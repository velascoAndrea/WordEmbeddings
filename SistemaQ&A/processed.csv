anarchism categories anarchism anticapitalism antifascism economic ideologies farleft politics leftwing politics libertarian socialism libertarianism political culture political ideologies political movements social theories socialism anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is against all forms of authority and seeks to abolish the institutions it claims maintain unnecessary coercion and hierarchy typically including the state and capitalism anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with stateless societies and voluntary free associations as a historically leftwing movement this reading of anarchism is placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum usually described as the libertarian wing of the socialist movement libertarian socialism although traces of anarchist ideas are found all throughout history modern anarchism emerged from the enlightenment during the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers struggles for emancipation various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period anarchists have taken part in several revolutions most notably in the paris commune the russian civil war and the spanish civil war whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism in the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more growing in popularity and influence within anticapitalist antiwar and antiglobalisation movements anarchists employ diverse approaches which may be generally divided into revolutionary and evolutionary strategies there is significant overlap between the two evolutionary methods try to simulate what an anarchist society might be like but revolutionary tactics which have historically taken a violent turn aim to overthrow authority and the state many facets of human civilization have been influenced by anarchist theory critique and praxis etymology terminology and definition the etymological origin of anarchism is from the ancient greek anarkhia ἀναρχία meaning without a ruler composed of the prefix an without and the word arkhos leader or ruler the suffix ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy anarchism appears in english from 1642 as anarchisme and anarchy from 1539 early english usages emphasised a sense of disorder various factions within the french revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as william godwin 17561836 and wilhelm weitling 18081871 would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist anarchiste was pierrejoseph proudhon 18091865 marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid19th century since the 1890s and beginning in france libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states some usages of libertarianism refer to individualistic freemarket philosophy only and freemarket anarchism in particular is termed libertarian anarchism while the term libertarian has been largely synonymous with anarchism its meaning has more recently been diluted by wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups including both the new left and libertarian marxists who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party and extreme cultural liberals who are primarily concerned with civil liberties additionally some anarchists use libertarian socialist to avoid anarchisms negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism anarchism is broadly used to describe the antiauthoritarian wing of the socialist movement anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are stateoriented or from above scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchisms socialist credentials and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from liberalism and being both liberal and socialist but more so many scholars reject anarchocapitalism as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles while opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought defining anarchism is not an easy task for scholars as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently major definitional elements include the will for a noncoercive society the rejection of the state apparatus the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a noncoercive society and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy history premodern era the most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in china and greece in china philosophical anarchism the discussion on the legitimacy of the state was delineated by taoist philosophers zhuang zhou and laozi alongside stoicism taoism has been said to have had significant anticipations of anarchism anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in greece aeschylus and sophocles used the myth of antigone to illustrate the conflict between laws imposed by the state and personal autonomy socrates questioned athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience cynics dismissed human law nomos and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature physis stoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state in medieval europe there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements these and other muslim movements later gave birth to religious anarchism in the sasanian empire mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy only to be soon executed by emperor kavad i in basra religious sects preached against the state in europe various sects developed antistate and libertarian tendencies renewed interest in antiquity during the renaissance and in private judgment during the reformation restored elements of antiauthoritarian secularism particularly in france enlightenment challenges to intellectual authority secular and religious and the revolutions of the 1790s and 1848 all spurred the ideological development of what became the era of classical anarchism modern era during the french revolution partisan groups such as the enragés and the sansculottes saw a turning point in the fermentation of antistate and federalist sentiments the first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century as william godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in england morally delegitimising the state max stirners thinking paved the way to individualism and pierrejoseph proudhons theory of mutualism found fertile soil in france by the late 1870s various anarchist schools of thought had become welldefined and a wave of then unprecedented globalisation occurred from 1880 to 1914 this era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the spanish civil war and is considered the golden age of anarchism drawing from mutualism mikhail bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the international workingmens association a class worker union later known as the first international that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents the international became a significant political force with karl marx being a leading figure and a member of its general council bakunins faction the jura federation and proudhons followers the mutualists opposed state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings after bitter disputes the bakuninists were expelled from the international by the marxists at the 1872 hague congress anarchists were treated similarly in the second international being ultimately expelled in 1896 bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by marxs terms they would end up the new tyrants of workers in response to their expulsion from the first international anarchists formed the st imier international under the influence of peter kropotkin a russian philosopher and scientist anarchocommunism overlapped with collectivism anarchocommunists who drew inspiration from the 1871 paris commune advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to ones needs by the turn of the 20th century anarchism had spread all over the world it was a notable feature of the international syndicalist movement in china small groups of students imported the humanistic proscience version of anarchocommunism tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from east asian countries who moved to the japanese capital to study in latin america argentina was a stronghold for anarchosyndicalism where it became the most prominent leftwing ideology during this time a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence known as propaganda of the deed the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the paris commune favoured individualist political expression and acts even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to prevent anarchists immigrating to the us including the immigration act of 1903 also called the anarchist exclusion act illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period despite concerns anarchists enthusiastically participated in the russian revolution in opposition to the white movement especially in the makhnovshchina however they met harsh suppression after the bolshevik government had stabilised including during the kronstadt rebellion several anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine before the bolsheviks crushed the anarchist movement there too with the anarchists being repressed in russia two new antithetical currents emerged namely platformism and synthesis anarchism the former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party seeing the victories of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war many workers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the united states members of major syndicalist movements such as the general confederation of labour and the industrial workers of the world left their organisations and joined the communist international in the spanish civil war of 193639 anarchists and syndicalists cnt and fai once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists a long tradition of spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war and particularly in the spanish revolution of 1936 in response to the army rebellion an anarchistinspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land the soviet union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war but the result was a bitter fight between communists and other leftists in a series of events known as the may days as joseph stalin asserted soviet control of the republican government ending in another defeat of anarchists at the hands of the communists postwwii by the end of world war ii the anarchist movement had been severely weakened the 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism likely caused by a perceived failure of marxismleninism and tensions built by the cold war during this time anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the antinuclear environmental and peace movements the counterculture of the 1960s and the new left it also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative anticapitalist reformism anarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols the established feminist tendencies of anarchafeminism returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism black anarchism began to take form at this time and influenced anarchisms move from a eurocentric demographic this coincided with its failure to gain traction in northern europe and its unprecedented height in latin america around the turn of the 21st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anticapitalist antiwar and antiglobalisation movements anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the world trade organization wto the group of eight and the world economic forum during the protests ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with the police other organisational tactics pioneered at this time include affinity groups security culture and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet a significant event of this period was the confrontations at the 1999 seattle wto conference anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the zapatistas in mexico and the democratic federation of northern syria more commonly known as rojava a de facto autonomous region in northern syria while having revolutionary aspirations many forms of anarchism are not confrontational nowadays instead they are trying to build an alternative way of social organization based on mutual interdependence and voluntary cooperation scholar carissa honeywell takes the example of food not bombs group of collectives to highlight some features of how anarchist groups work direct action working together and in solidarity with those left behind while doing so they inform about the rising rates of world hunger suggest a policy to tackle hunger ranging from defunding the arms industry to addressing monsanto seedsaving policies and patents helping farmers and commodification of food and housing honeywell also emphasizes that contemporary anarchists are interested in the flourishing not only of humans but nonhumans and the environment as well honeywell argues that escalation of problems such as continuous wars and world poverty show that the current framework not only cannot solve those pressing problems for humanity but are causal factors as well resulting in the rejection of representative democracy and the state as a whole thought anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions social anarchism and individualist anarchism owing to their different origins values and evolution the individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual while the social current emphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership in a chronological sense anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century and the postclassical currents anarchafeminism green anarchism and postanarchism developed thereafter beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state but claims that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have a central role in anarchist philosophy anarchisms emphasis on anticapitalism egalitarianism and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from anarchocapitalism and other types of economic libertarianism anarchism is usually placed on the farleft of the political spectrum much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect antiauthoritarian antistatist libertarian and radical interpretations of leftwing and socialist politics such as collectivism communism individualism mutualism and syndicalism among other libertarian socialist economic theories as anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by fernando tarrida del mármol in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time belief in political nihilism has been espoused by anarchists despite separation the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of shared principles such as autonomy mutual aid antiauthoritarianism and decentralisation classical inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism and individualism they were followed by the major currents of social anarchism collectivist communist and syndicalist they differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society mutualism is an 18thcentury economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by pierrejoseph proudhon its aims include abolishing the state reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and monetary reform of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism in what is property 1840 proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property collectivist anarchism is a revolutionary socialist form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution and that workers be paid according to time worked rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism collectivist anarchism arose alongside marxism but rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society anarchocommunism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production held by a federal network of voluntary associations with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need anarchocommunism developed from radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international it was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of peter kropotkin whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late 19th century anarchosyndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically selfmanaged by workers the basic principles of anarchosyndicalism are direct action workers solidarity and workers selfmanagement individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include william godwin max stirner and henry david thoreau through many countries individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation postclassical and contemporary anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the antiglobalisation movement whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation as the movement shaped 21st century radicalism wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches the anticapitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchisms historical association with chaos and violence its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to engage with the anarchist movement although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory various anarchist groups tendencies and schools of thought exist today making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement while theorists and activists have established relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple anarchisms rather than a singular anarchism in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently gender equality can be a common principle although it ranks as a higher priority to anarchafeminists than anarchocommunists anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms namely all centralized and hierarchical forms of government eg monarchy representative democracy state socialism etc economic class systems eg capitalism bolshevism feudalism slavery etc autocratic religions eg fundamentalist islam roman catholicism etc patriarchy heterosexism white supremacy and imperialism anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed the principle of equal liberty is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions this entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy tactics anarchists tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals namely to first oppose the establishment and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society illustrating the unity of means and ends a broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other evolutionary tactics embrace nonviolence reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims although there is significant overlap between the two anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches classical era during the classical era anarchists had a militant tendency not only did they confront state armed forces as in spain and ukraine but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state some of which were successful anarchists also took part in revolutions many anarchists especially the galleanists believed that these attempts would be the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late 1870s the early 1880s and the 1890s with some still occurring in the early 1900s their decrease in prevalence was the result of further judicial power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been controversial anarchopacifists advocate for nonviolence means to achieve their stateless nonviolent ends other anarchist groups advocate direct action a tactic which can include acts of sabotage or terrorism this attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a tyrant and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible emma goldman and errico malatesta who were proponents of limited use of violence stated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil anarchists took an active role in strike actions although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism seeing it as reformist they saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts some of whom practiced naturism and nudism those anarchists also built communities which were based on friendship and were involved in the news media revolutionary in the current era italian anarchist alfredo bonanno a proponent of insurrectionary anarchism has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards both bonanno and the french group the invisible committee advocate for small informal affiliation groups where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state capitalism and other enemies members of the invisible committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges terrorism included overall contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors they mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots especially in countries such as canada greece and mexico militant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police however anarchists not only clash with state operators they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists taking antifascist action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening evolutionary anarchists commonly employ direct action this can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy or the form of selfmanaging their lives through the creation of counterinstitutions such as communes and nonhierarchical collectives decisionmaking is often handled in an antiauthoritarian way with everyone having equal say in each decision an approach known as horizontalism contemporaryera anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are more or less based on horizontalism although not explicitly anarchist respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations in contrast with the biga anarchism of the classical era the newly coined term smalla anarchism signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classicalera anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as peter kropotkin and pierrejoseph proudhon to justify their opinions those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize the decisionmaking process of small anarchist affinity groups plays a significant tactical role anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group one way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point minorities usually accept rough consensus except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics goals and values anarchists usually form small groups 520 individuals to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members these kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other forming larger networks anarchists still support and participate in strikes especially wildcat strikes as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate as in the past newspapers and journals are used and anarchists have gone online in the world wide web to spread their message anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties hosting electronic libraries and other portals anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free the way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals especially when it comes to preserving users privacy from state surveillance anarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces during important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied they are often called temporary autonomous zones taz spaces where art poetry and surrealism are blended to display the anarchist ideal as seen by anarchists squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events make up a carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity key issues as anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed and anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as communism collectivism marxism and trade unionism anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened selfinterest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines phenomena such as civilisation technology eg within anarchoprimitivism and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others the state objection to the state and its institutions is a sine qua non of anarchism anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life major decisions are taken by a small elite authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless of whether that power is open or transparent as it still has the ability to coerce people another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government even the most altruistic among officials will unavoidably seek to gain more power leading to corruption anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary robert paul wolff believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate bakunin saw the state as meaning coercion domination by means of coercion camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be a john simmons and leslie green who leaned toward philosophical anarchism believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus although they saw this as highly unlikely beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ gender sexuality and free love as gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy many anarchists address analyse and oppose the suppression of ones autonomy imposed by gender roles sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as benjamin tucker who opposed age of consent laws believing they would benefit predatory men a historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was free love in contemporary anarchism this current survives as a tendency to support polyamory relationship anarchy and queer anarchism free love advocates were against marriage which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men the notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited womens sexual freedom and pleasure those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses where large groups of travelers anarchists and other activists slept in beds together free love had roots both in europe and the united states however some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love anarchist feminists were advocates of free love against marriage and prochoice utilising a contemporary term and had a similar agenda anarchist and nonanarchist feminists differed on suffrage but were supportive of one another during the second half of the 20th century anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well by the latest decades of the 20th century anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women gays queers and other marginalised groups with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents with the third wave of feminism sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists yielding a poststructuralist critique of sexual normality some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation education the interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism anarchists consider proper education one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society to be an act of mutual aid anarchist writers such as william godwin political justice and max stirner the false principle of our education attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges in 1901 catalan anarchist and free thinker francisco ferrer established the escuela moderna in barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the catholic church ferrers approach was secular rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students the school closed after constant harassment by the state and ferrer was later arrested nonetheless his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools around the world christian anarchist leo tolstoy who published the essay education and culture also established a similar school with its founding principle being that for education to be effective it had to be free in a similar token a s neill founded what became the summerhill school in 1921 also declaring being free from coercion anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a childs right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions however there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism along with other critiques of government and nationalism late 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers paul goodman herbert read and colin ward intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on childrens creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in consumerism as part of a consumer society contemporary anarchists such as ward claim that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality while few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modernday major tenets of anarchist schools among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method have spread among mainstream educational institutions judith suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools namely the free skool santa cruz in the united states which is part of a wider americancanadian network of schools the selfmanaged learning college in brighton england and the paideia school in spain the arts the connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists surrealists and others in literature anarchism was mostly associated with the new apocalyptics and the neoromanticism movement in music anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk anarchists such as leo tolstoy and herbert read stated that the border between the artist and the nonartist what separates art from a daily act is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends in his book breaking the spell a history of anarchist filmmakers videotape guerrillas and digital ninjas chris robé claims that anarchistinflected practices have increasingly structured movementbased video activism throughout the 20th century many prominent anarchists peter kropotkin emma goldman gustav landauer and camillo berneri and publications such as anarchy wrote about matters pertaining to the arts three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists it could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests as it appeals to both emotion and reason art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect the 19thcentury neoimpressionist movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism in les chataigniers a osny by anarchist painter camille pissarro the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community criticism the most common critique of anarchism is the assertion that humans cannot selfgovern and so a state is necessary for human survival philosopher bertrand russell supported this critique stating that peace and war tariffs regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs the preservation of a just system of distribution these among others are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be selfgoverning a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated anarchist federalism another criticism of anarchism is the belief that it is inherently unstable that an anarchist society would inevitably evolve back into a state thomas hobbes and other early social contract theorists argued that the state emerges in response to natural anarchy in order to protect the peoples interests and keep order philosopher robert nozick argued that a nightwatchman state or minarchy would emerge from anarchy through the process of an invisible hand in which people would exercise their liberty and buy protection from protection agencies evolving into a minimal state anarchists reject these criticisms by arguing that humans in a state of nature would not just be in a state of war anarchoprimitivists in particular argue that humans were better off in a state of nature in small tribes living close to the land while anarchists in general argue that the negatives of state organization such as hierarchies monopolies and inequality outweigh the benefits philosophy lecturer andrew g fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction not only in the pragmatic world such as at protests but in the world of ethics as well secondly anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state cannot be defeated practically this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it the third argument is that anarchism is selfcontradictory as a ruling theory that has no ruling theory anarchism also calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual hence no collective action can be taken lastly fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective all talk and thoughts and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of proanarchist books such as a john simmons moral principles and political obligations law professor william a edmundson authored an essay to argue against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious edmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate in the problem of political authority michael huemer defends philosophical anarchism claiming that political authority is a moral illusion one of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority joseph raz states that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities successful and mistaken instruction anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment anarchist perception of human nature rejection of the state and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive overly simplistic and unrealistic respectively classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering friedrich engels considered to be one of the principal founders of marxism criticised anarchisms antiauthoritarianism as inherently counterrevolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian academic john molyneux writes in his book anarchism a marxist criticism that anarchism cannot win believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas the marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values according to the marxist view that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act in the anarchist vision the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining see also anarchist communities references explanatory notes

atmospheric composition geographic location and time see position of the sun while bihemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence ie for a given position of the sun albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period the temporal resolution may range from seconds as obtained from flux measurements to daily monthly or annual averages unless given for a specific wavelength spectral albedo albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation due to measurement constraints it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface between 03 and 3 μm this spectrum includes visible light 0407 μm which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark eg trees absorb most radiation whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright eg snow reflects most radiation icealbedo feedback is a positive feedback climate process where a change in the area of ice caps glaciers and sea ice alters the albedo and surface temperature of a planet ice is very reflective therefore it reflects far more solar energy back to space than the other types of land area or open water icealbedo feedback plays an important role in global climate change albedo is an important concept in climate science terrestrial albedo any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 09 for fresh snow to about 004 for charcoal one of the darkest substances deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body when seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms most land areas are in an albedo range of 01 to 04 the average albedo of earth is about 03 this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds earths surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasas modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites and the ceres instrument on the suomi npp and jpss as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite not all directions a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directionalhemispherical reflectance and bihemispherical reflectance eg these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedojuly 2023 earths average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15 if earth were frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below 40 if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 in contrast if the entire earth was covered by water  a socalled ocean planet  the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27 in 2021 scientists reported that earth dimmed by 05 over two decades 19982017 as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques this may have both been cocaused by climate change as well as a substantial increase in global warming however the link to climate change has not been explored to date and it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend whitesky blacksky and bluesky albedo for land surfaces it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle θi can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms this formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface human activities human activities eg deforestation farming and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe as per campra et al human impacts to the physical properties of the land surface can perturb the climate by altering the earths radiative energy balance even on a small scale or when undetected by satellites the tens of thousands of hectares of greenhouses in almería spain form a large expanse of whitened plastic roofs a 2008 study found that this anthropogenic change lowered the local surface area temperature of the highalbedo area although changes were localized a followup study found that co2eq emissions associated to changes in surface albedo are a consequence of land transformation and can reduce surface temperature increases associated with climate change it has been found that urbanization generally decreases albedo commonly being 001002 lower than adjacent croplands which contributes to global warming deliberately increasing albedo in urban areas can mitigate urban heat island ouyang et al estimated that on a global scale an albedo increase of 01 in worldwide urban areas would result in a cooling effect that is equivalent to absorbing 44 gt of co2 emissions intentionally enhancing the albedo of the earths surface along with its daytime thermal emittance has been proposed as a solar radiation management strategy to mitigate energy crises and global warming known as passive daytime radiative cooling pdrc efforts toward widespread implementation of pdrcs may focus on maximizing the albedo of surfaces from very low to high values so long as a thermal emittance of at least 90 can be achieved examples of terrestrial albedo effects illumination albedo is not directly dependent on the illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the earths surface at that location eg through melting of reflective ice that said albedo and illumination both vary by latitude albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics with a local maximum in the tropics insolation effects the intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation solar irradiance high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation whereas areas such as the sahara desert which also have a relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation tropical and subtropical rainforest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb effectively cooling the earth this has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker being water or ground which is darker color and reflects less heat back into space this feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect climate and weather albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land ice or ocean surfaces can drive weatherjuly 2023 the response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks increased by selfreinforcing or positive feedbacks and reduced by balancing or negative feedbacks the main reinforcing feedbacks are the watervapour feedback the icealbedo feedback and the net effect of clouds58 albedotemperature feedback when an areas albedo changes due to snowfall a snowtemperature feedback results a layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling in principle if no outside temperature change affects this area eg a warm air mass the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snowtemperature feedback however because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight higher insolation cause melting when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass soil or ocean the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating snow snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as 09 for freshly fallen snow to about 04 for melting snow and as low as 02 for dirty snow over antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than 08 if a marginally snowcovered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack the icealbedo positive feedback in switzerland the citizens have been protecting their glaciers with large white tarpaulins to slow down the ice melt these large white sheets are helping to reject the rays from the sun and defecting the heat although that this method is very expensive it has shown to work by reducing snow and ice melt by 60 just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow the albedo of snowcovered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow when sea ice melts either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above the snowcovered surface is reduced and more surface of sea water is exposed so the rate of energy absorption increases the extra absorbed energy heats the sea water which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts as with the preceding example of snowmelt the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for global warmingjanuary 2018 cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets the dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates because of this in order to reduce the error of energy estimates it is important to measure the albedo of snowcovered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regionsjanuary 2018 smallscale effects albedo works on a smaller scale too in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and lightcoloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing solar photovoltaic effects albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices for example the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon asih and crystalline silicon csibased compared to traditional spectralintegrated albedo predictions research showed impacts of over 10 for vertically 90 mounted systems but such effects were substantially lower for systems with lower surface tilts spectral albedo strongly affects the performance of bifacial solar cells where rear surface performance gains of over 20 have been observed for csi cells installed above healthy vegetation an analysis on the bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials both humanmade and natural provided effective albedo values for simulating the performance of seven photovoltaic materials mounted on three common photovoltaic system topologies industrial solar farms commercial flat rooftops and residential pitchedroof applications trees forests generally have a low albedo because the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis for this reason the greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation in other words the climate change mitigation effect of carbon sequestration by forests is partially counterbalanced in that reforestation can decrease the reflection of sunlight albedo in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be significant enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts as strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate midtohighlatitude forests have a much lower albedo during snow seasons than flat ground thus contributing to warming modeling that compares the effects of albedo differences between forests and grasslands suggests that expanding the land area of forests in temperate zones offers only a temporary mitigation benefit in seasonally snowcovered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are 10 to 50 higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 015 to 018 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 009 to 015 variation in summer albedo across both forest types is associated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy the result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes eg siberia were neutral or perhaps warming water water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner not diffusely the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this at small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivityvsincidentangle curve and a locally increased average incident angle although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 09 clouds cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 08 on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies aerosol effects aerosols very fine particlesdroplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on earths radiative balance the direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain as per spracklen et al the effects are in extremely polluted cities like delhi aerosol pollutants influence local weather and induce an urban cool island effect during the day black carbon another albedorelated effect on the climate is from black carbon particles the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is 02 w m2 with a range 01 to 04 w m2 black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedojanuary 2020 astronomical albedo in astronomy the term albedo can be defined in several different ways depending upon the application and the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation involved optical or visual albedo the albedos of planets satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of photometry for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids enceladus a moon of saturn has one of the highest known optical albedos of any body in the solar system with an albedo of 099 another notable highalbedo body is eris with an albedo of 096 many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 005 a typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 004 such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around 014 but it is strongly directional and nonlambertian displaying also a strong opposition effect although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies two common optical albedos that are used in astronomy are the vband geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion in detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semiempirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces one of these five parameters is yet another type of albedo called the singlescattering albedo it is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles it depends on properties of the material refractive index the size of the particle and the wavelength of the incoming radiation an important relationship between an objects astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is given by radar albedo those components of the received echo that return from firstsurface reflections as from a smooth or mirrorlike surface are dominated by the oc component as there is a reversal in polarization upon reflection if the surface is rough at the wavelength scale or there is significant penetration into the regolith there will be a significant sc component in the echo caused by multiple scattering for most objects in the solar system the oc echo dominates and the most commonly reported radar albedo parameter is the normalized oc radar albedo often shortened to radar albedo radar albedos of solar system objects the values reported for the moon mercury mars venus and comet p2005 jq5 are derived from the total ocsc radar albedo reported in those references relationship to surface bulk density history the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his 1760 work photometriajuly 2023 see also references external links a categories iso basic latin letters vowel letters a or a is the first letter and the first vowel letter of the latin alphabet used in the modern english alphabet the alphabets of other western european languages and others worldwide its name in english is a pronounced  ay plural aes it is similar in shape to the ancient greek letter alpha from which it derives the uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar the lowercase version can be written in two forms the doublestorey a and singlestorey ɑ the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it especially fonts intended to be read by children and is also found in italic type in english a is the indefinite article with the alternative form an name in english the name of the letter is the long a sound pronounced  its name in most other languages matches the letters pronunciation in open syllables history the earliest known certain ancestor of a is aleph also written aleph the first letter of the phoenician alphabet which only used letters to denote consonants in turn the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in protosinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs styled as a triangular head with two horns extended when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stopthe consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letterso they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel a and called it by the similar name of alpha in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the eighth century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages including english typographic variants during roman times there were many variant forms of the letter a first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other more permanent media there was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles the known variants include the early semiuncial the uncial and the later semiuncial at the end of the roman empire 5th century ad several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or angloirish semiuncial or anglosaxon majuscule of great britain by the ninth century the caroline script which was very similar to the presentday form was the principal form used in bookmaking before the advent of the printing press this form was derived through a combining of prior forms 15thcentury italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today these variants the italic and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version the italic form also called script a is used in most current handwriting it consists of a circle and vertical stroke on the right ɑ this slowly developed from the fifthcentury form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers the roman form is used in most printed material it consists of a small loop with an arc over it a both derive from the majuscule capital form in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown many fonts then made the right leg vertical in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form graphic designers refer to the italic and roman forms as singledecker a and double decker a respectively italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest set in roman type there are some other cases aside from italic type where script a ɑ also called latin alpha is used in contrast with latin a such as in the international phonetic alphabet use in writing systems english in modern english orthography the letter a represents at least seven

in the american revolutionary war spain held mobile as part of spanish west florida until 1813 in december 1819 alabama was recognized as a state during the antebellum period alabama was a major producer of cotton and widely used african american slave labor in 1861 the state seceded from the united states to become part of the confederate states of america with montgomery acting as its first capital and rejoined the union in 1868 following the american civil war alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship in part due to agriculture and a few cash crops being the main driver of the states economy similar to other former slave states alabamian legislators employed jim crow laws from the late 19th century up until the 1960s highprofile events such as the selma to montgomery march

american football particularly at the college level plays a major part of the states culture etymology the europeanamerican naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people a muskogeanspeaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river in the alabama language the word for a person of alabama lineage is albaamo or variously albaama or albàamo in different dialects the plural form is albaamaha the words spelling varies significantly among historical sources the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of 1540 garcilaso de la vega used alibamo while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu respectively in transliterations of the term as early as 1702 the french called the tribe the alibamon with french maps identifying the river as rivière des alibamons other spellings of the name have included alibamu alabamo albama alebamon alibama alibamou alabamu and allibamou the use of state names derived from native american languages is common in the us an estimated 26 states have names of native american origin sources disagree on the words meaning some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants the state has numerous place names of native american origin an 1842 article in the jacksonville republican

mobile in 1702 the city was moved to the current site of mobile in 1711 this area was claimed by the french from 1702 to 1763 as part of la louisiane after the french lost to the british in the seven years war it became part of british west florida from 1763 to 1783 after the united states victory in the american revolutionary war the territory was divided between the united states and spain the latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the spanish garrison at mobile to us forces on april 13 1813 thomas bassett a loyalist to the british monarchy during the revolutionary era was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside mobile he settled in the tombigbee district during the early 1770s the districts boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the tombigbee river and included portions of what is today southern clarke county northernmost mobile county and most of washington county what are now baldwin and mobile counties became part of spanish west florida in 1783 part of the independent republic of west florida in 1810 and finally part of the mississippi territory in 1812 most of what is now the northern twothirds of alabama was known as the yazoo lands beginning during the british colonial period it was claimed by the province of georgia from 1767 onwards following the revolutionary war it remained a part of georgia although heavily disputed with the exception of the area around mobile and the yazoo lands what is now the lower onethird of alabama was made part of the mississippi territory when it was organized in 1798 the yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804 following the yazoo land scandal spain kept a claim on its former spanish west florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the adamsonís treaty officially ceded it to the united states in 1819 19th century before mississippis admission to statehood on december 10 1817 the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the alabama territory the united states congress created the alabama territory on march 3 1817 st stephens now abandoned served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819 alabama was admitted as the 22nd state on december 14 1819 with congress selecting huntsville as the site for the first constitutional convention from julyspaces5 to august 2 1819 delegates met to prepare the new state constitution huntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820 when the seat of government moved to cahaba in dallas county cahaba now a ghost town was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825 the alabama fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the union with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men southeastern planters and traders from the upper south brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in alabama expanded the economy of the central black belt named for its dark productive soil was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew mainly from slave labor the area also drew many poor disenfranchised people who became subsistence farmers alabama had an estimated population of under 10000 people in 1810 but it increased to more than 300000 people by 1830 most native american tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the indian removal act by congress in 1830 from 1826 to 1846 tuscaloosa served as alabamas capital on january 30 1846 the alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from tuscaloosa to montgomery the first legislative session in the new capital met in december 1847 a new capitol building was erected under the direction of stephen decatur button of philadelphia the first structure burned down in 1849 but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851 this second capitol building in montgomery remains to the present day it was designed by barachias holt of exeter maine civil war and reconstruction by 1860 the population had increased to 964201 people of which nearly half 435080 were enslaved african americans and 2690 were free people of color on january 11 1861 alabama declared its secession from the union after remaining an independent republic for a few days it joined the confederate states of america the confederacys capital was initially at montgomery alabama was heavily involved in the american civil war although comparatively few battles were fought in the state alabama contributed about 120000 soldiers to the war effort a company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville alabama joined nathan bedford forrests battalion in hopkinsville kentucky the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coattails this led to them being greeted with yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate army alabamas slaves were freed by the 13th amendment in 1865 alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in may 1865 until its official restoration to the union in 1868 from 1867 to 1874 with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised many african americans emerged as political leaders in the state alabama was represented in congress during this period by three africanamerican congressmen jeremiah haralson benjamin s turner and james t rapier following the war the state remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton during reconstruction state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 which created the states first public school system and expanded womens rights legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation organized insurgent resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans besides the shortlived original ku klux klan these included the pale faces knights of the white camellia red shirts and the white league reconstruction in alabama ended in 1874 when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governors office through an election dominated by fraud and violence they wrote another constitution in 1875 and the legislature passed the blaine amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religiousaffiliated schools the same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891 20th century the new 1901 constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population including nearly all african americans and native americans and tens of thousands of poor european americans through making voter registration difficult requiring a poll tax and literacy test the 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools by 1903 only 2980 african americans were registered in alabama although at least 74000 were literate this compared to more than 181000 african americans eligible to vote in 1900 the numbers dropped even more in later decades the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s jails were segregated in 1911 hospitals in 1915 toilets hotels and restaurants in 1928 and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945 while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax by 1941 whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws 600000 whites vs 520000 african americans nearly all blacks had lost the ability to vote despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens the ruraldominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid onethird of the construction costs the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas they often donated land and labor as well beginning in 1913 the first 80 rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african american children a total of 387 schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the great migration out of the south reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920 at the same time many rural people migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the magic city by 1920 birmingham was the 36thlargest city in the united states heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy its residents were underrepresented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution this did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile between 1940 and 1943 more than 89000 people moved into the city to work for warrelated industries cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961 the ruraldominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas one result was that jefferson county containing birminghams industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than onethird of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature a 1960 study noted that because of rural domination a minority of about 25 of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature in the united states supreme court cases of baker v carr 1962 and reynolds v sims 1964 the court ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties african americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement including legal challenges in 1954 the us supreme court ruled in brown v board of education that public schools had to be desegregated but alabama was slow to comply during the 1960s under governor george wallace alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama including the montgomery bus boycott 19551956 freedom rides in 1961 and 1965 selma to montgomery marches these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 by the us congress legal segregation ended in the states in 1964 but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court according to the new york times by 2017 many of alabamas african americans were living in alabamas cities such as birmingham and montgomery also the black belt region across central alabama is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly africanamerican these counties include dallas lowndes marengo and perry in 1972 for the first time since 1901 the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census this benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation in the 1980s an omnibus redistricting case dillard v crenshaw county challenged the atlarge voting for representative seats of 180 alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards atlarge voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county as the majority tended to take all seats despite african americans making up a significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the atlarge jurisdictions as part of settlement of this case five alabama cities and counties including chilton county adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multiseat jurisdictions this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters in another form of proportional representation 23 jurisdictions use limited voting as in conecuh county in 1982 limited voting was first tested in conecuh county together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens beginning in the 1960s the states economy shifted away from its traditional lumber steel and textile industries because of increased foreign competition steel jobs for instance declined from 46314 in 1950 to 14185 in 2011 however the state particularly huntsville benefited from the opening of the george c marshall space flight center in 1960 a major facility in the development of the saturn rocket program and the space shuttle technology and manufacturing industries such as automobile assembly replaced some the states older industries in the late twentieth century but the states economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area such as georgia and florida 21st century in 2001 alabama supreme court chief justice roy moore installed a statue of the ten commandments in the capitol in montgomery in 2002 the 11th us circuit court ordered the statue removed but moore refused to follow the court

leaving practically no power in local hands most counties do not have home rule any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and frequently by state referendum the former constitution was particularly criticized for its complexity and length intentionally codifying segregation and racism alabamas government is divided into three coequal branches the legislative branch is the alabama legislature a bicameral assembly composed of the alabama house of representatives with 105 members and the alabama senate with 35 members the legislature is responsible for writing debating passing or defeating state legislation the republican party currently holds a majority in both houses of the legislature the legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority most state legislatures require a twothirds majority to override a veto until 1964 the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county with one per county it had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901 as a result urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses either in reynolds v sims 1964 the us supreme court implemented the principle of one man one vote ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented further the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems at that time alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas for instance birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied onethird of the state budget but jefferson county received only 167th of state services in funding through the legislative delegations the alabama legislature kept control of county governments the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws it is headed by the governor of alabama other members of the executive branch include the cabinet the lieutenant governor of alabama the attorney general of alabama the alabama secretary of state the alabama state treasurer and the state auditor of alabama the current governor is republican kay ivey the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections statewide officials such as the governor lieutenant governor attorney general and other constitutional officers take office the following january the judiciary is responsible for interpreting the constitution of alabama and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases the states highest court is the supreme court of alabama alabama uses partisan elections to select judges since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized the current chief justice of the alabama supreme court is republican tom parker all sitting justices on the alabama supreme court are members of the republican party there are two intermediate appellate courts the court of civil appeals and the court of criminal appeals and four trial courts the circuit court trial court of general jurisdiction and the district probate and municipal courts alabama has the death penalty with authorized methods of execution that include the electric chair and the gas chamber some critics believe the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country in some years it imposes more death sentences than does texas a state which has a population five times larger however executions per capita are significantly higher in texas some of its cases have been highly controversial the us supreme court has overturned 24 convictions in death penalty casesmarch 2017 it was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole that were voted unanimously by juries this judicial authority was removed in april 2017 on may 14 2019 alabama passed the human life protection act banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy unless there is a serious health risk with no exceptions for rape and incest the law subjects doctors who perform abortions with 10 to 99 years imprisonment the law was originally supposed to take effect the following november but on october 29 2019 us district judge myron thompson blocked the law from taking effect due to it being in conflict with the 1973 us supreme court case roe v wade on june 24 2022 after the us supreme court overturned roe v wade in dobbs v jackson womens health organization judge thompson lifted the injunction allowing the law to go into effect alabama is one of the very few states that does not allow the creation of state lotteries taxes taxes are collected by the alabama department of revenue alabama levies a 2 4 orspaces5 personal income tax depending on the amount earned and filing status taxpayers are allowed to deduct their

sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases for example the total sales tax rate in mobile county alabama is 10 and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1 which means a

state in the country property taxes of 40 of assessed value per year are the secondlowest in the us after hawaii the current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes county and local governments alabama has 67 counties each county has its own elected legislative branch usually called the county commission it also has limited executive authority in the county because of the constraints of the alabama constitution which centralizes power in the state legislature only seven counties jefferson lee mobile madison montgomery shelby and tuscaloosa in the state have limited home rule instead most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the 1973 alabama constitutional commission legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county united states supreme court decisions in baker v carr 1964 required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census to implement the principle of one man one vote before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to underrepresentation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties the rural bias of the state legislature which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house affected politics well into the 20th century failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution alabamas constitution has been amended more than 700 times and almost onethird of the amendments are local in nature applying to only one county or city a significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state meaning the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol the alabama alcoholic beverage control board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state a total of 25 of the 67 counties are dry counties which ban the sale of alcohol and there are many dry municipalities in counties which permit alcohol sales politics during reconstruction following the american civil war alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope in 1874 the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans in part by suppressing the black vote through violence fraud and intimidation after 1890 a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor whites by 1941 more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised 600000 to 520000 the total effects were greater on the black community as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law from 1901 through the 1960s the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas as counties were the basis of election districts the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly threequarters of the century until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement when whites bureaucratically and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform governor george wallace the states only fourterm governor was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation only after passage of the federal civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage among other civil rights in many jurisdictions they continued to be excluded from representation by atlarge electoral systems which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish singlemember districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards in 2007 the alabama legislature passed and republican governor bob riley signed a resolution expressing profound regret over slavery and its lingering impact in a symbolic ceremony the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol which housed congress of the confederate states of america in 2010 republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years 2023 there are a total of 3707233 registered voters with 3318679 active and the others inactive in the state the 2023 american values atlas by public religion research institute found that a majority of alabama residents support samesex marriage elections state elections with the disfranchisement of blacks in 1901 the state became part of the solid south a system in which the democratic party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every southern state for nearly a hundred years local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election since the mid to late 20th century however white conservatives started shifting to the republican party in alabama majoritywhite districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal state and local office members of the nine seats on the supreme court of alabama and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office until 1994 no republicans held any of the court seats in that general election the thenincumbent chief justice ernest c hornsby refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3000 votes to republican perry o hooper sr hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in courtjanuary 2021 the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august 2011 with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench in the early 21st century republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of education in 2010 republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years the last remaining statewide democrat who served on the alabama public service commission was defeated in 2012 only three republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of reconstruction when republicans generally represented reconstruction government including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise the three gop lieutenant governors are steve windom 19992003 kay ivey 20112017 and will ainsworth 2019present local elections many local offices county commissioners boards of education tax assessors mayors etc in the state are still held by democrats many metropolitan and suburban counties have voters who are majority democrats resulting in local elections being decided in the democratic primary similarly most rural counties are majorityrepublican and elections are effectively decided in the republican primary however since local governments in alabama are weaker than in other parts of the country republicans have the upper hand in government alabamas 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan atlarge races and republicans retain the vast majority of those posts the current split is 18 democrats and 49 republicans as of 2023 however most of the democratic sheriffs preside over urban and more populated counties the majority of republican sheriffs have been elected in the more rural counties with lower population the state of alabama has and 11 africanamerican sheriffs federal elections the states two us senators are katie britt and tommy tuberville both of whom are republican in the us house

external links achilles categories greek mythological heroes kings of the myrmidons achaean leaders thessalians in the trojan war metamorphoses characters mythological rapists demigods in classical mythology lgbt themes in greek mythology achilles deeds of apollo medea princes in greek mythology in greek mythology achilles ə ə or achilleus achilleús was a hero of the trojan war who was known as being the greatest of all the greek warriors a central character in homers iliad he was the son of the nereid thetis and peleus king of phthia and famous argonaut achilles was raised in phthia along with his childhood companion patroclus and received his education by the centaur chiron in the iliad he is presented as the commander of the mythical tribe of the myrmidons achilles most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan prince hector outside the gates of troy although the death of achilles is not presented in the iliad other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris who shot him with an arrow later legends beginning with statius unfinished epic achilleid written in the 1st century ad state that achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel according to that myth when his mother thetis dipped him in the river styx as an infant she held him by one of his heels leaving it untouched by the waters and thus his only vulnerable body part alluding to these legends the term achilles heel has come to mean a point of weakness which can lead to downfall especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution the achilles tendon is named after him following the same legend etymology linear b tablets attest to the personal name achilleus in the forms akireu and akirewe the latter being the dative of the former the name grew more popular becoming common soon after the seventh century bc and was also turned into the female form ἀχιλλεία achilleía attested in attica in the fourth century bc ig ii² 1617 and in the form achillia on a stele in halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an amazon achilles name can be analyzed as a combination of ἄχος grc distress pain sorrow grief and λαός grc people soldiers nation resulting in a protoform akhílāuos he who has the people distressed or he whose people have distress the grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the iliad and frequently by achilles himself achilles role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of κλέος grc glory usually in war furthermore laós has been construed by gregory nagy following leonard palmer to mean a corps of soldiers a muster with this derivation the name obtains a double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring distress to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership some researchers deem the name a loan word possibly from a pregreek language achilles descent from the nereid thetis and a similarity of his name with those of river deities such as acheron and achelous have led to speculations about his being an old water divinity  below robert s p beekes has suggested a pregreek origin of the name based among other things on the coexistence of λλ and λ in epic language which may account for a palatalized phoneme ly in the original language birth and early years achilles was the son of thetismdasha nereid and daughter of the old man of the seamdashand peleus the king of the myrmidons zeus and poseidon had been rivals for thetiss hand in marriage until prometheus the forethinker warned zeus of a prophecy originally uttered by themis goddess of divine law that thetis would bear a son greater than his father for this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed peleus there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events in the argonautica 4760 zeus sister and wife hera alludes to thetis chaste resistance to the advances of zeus pointing out that thetis was so loyal to heras marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods thetis although a daughter of the seagod nereus was also brought up by hera further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal according to the achilleid written by statius in the 1st century ad and to nonsurviving previous sources when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx however he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his left heel see achilles heel achilles tendon it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier in another version of this story thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage none of the sources before statius make any reference to this general invulnerability to the contrary in the iliad homer mentions achilles being wounded in book 21 the paeonian hero asteropaios son of pelagon challenged achilles by the river scamander he was ambidextrous and cast a spear from each hand one grazed achilles elbow drawing a spurt of blood in the few fragmentary poems of the epic cycle which describe the heros death ie the cypria the little iliad by lesches of pyrrha the aethiopis and iliupersis by arctinus of miletus there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel in the later vase paintings presenting the death of achilles the arrow or in many cases arrows hit his torso peleus entrusted achilles to chiron who lived on mount pelion and was known as the most righteous of the centaurs to be reared in some accounts achilles original name was ligyron and he was later named achilles by his tutor chiron according to homer achilles grew up in phthia with his childhood companion patroclus homer further writes that achilles taught patroclus what he himself had been taught by chiron including the medical arts thetis foretold that her sons fate was either to gain glory and die young or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity achilles chose the former and decided to take part in the trojan war according to photius the sixth book of the new history by ptolemy hephaestion reported that thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by peleus when she had achilles peleus noticed tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot and confided him to the centaur chiron later chiron exhumed the body of the damysus who was the fastest of all the giants removed the ankle and incorporated it into achilles burnt foot physical description in the account of dares the phrygian achilles was described having  a large chest a fine mouth and powerfully formed arms and legs his head was covered with long wavy chestnutcolored hair though mild in manner he was very fierce in battle his face showed the joy of a man richly endowed homer described achilles along with numerous other characters as being blond other names among the appellations under which achilles is generally known are the following hidden on skyros some posthomeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war thetis or in some versions peleus hid the young man dressed as a princess or at least a girl at the court of lycomedes king of skyros there achilles properly disguised lived among lycomedes daughters perhaps under the name pyrrha the redhaired girl cercysera or aissa swift with lycomedes daughter deidamia with whom he had begun a relationship achilles there fathered two sons neoptolemus also called pyrrhus after his fathers possible alias and oneiros according to this story odysseus learned from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles aid odysseus went to skyros in the guise of a pedlar selling womens clothes and jewellery and placed a shield and spear among his goods when achilles instantly took up the spear odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the greek campaign in another version of the story odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes women while the women fled in panic achilles prepared to defend the court thus giving his identity away in the trojan war according to the iliad achilles arrived at troy with 50 ships each carrying 50 myrmidons he appointed five leaders each leader commanding 500 myrmidons menesthius eudorus peisander phoenix and alcimedon telephus when the greeks left for the trojan war they accidentally stopped in mysia ruled by king telephus in the resulting battle achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal guided by the oracle he arrived at argos where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy according to other reports in euripides lost play about telephus he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge alternatively telephus held orestes for ransom the ransom being achilles aid in healing the wound odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore the spear must be able to heal it pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed troilus according to the cypria the part of the epic cycle that tells the events of the trojan war before achilles wrath when the achaeans desired to return home they were restrained by achilles who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas sacked neighbouring cities like pedasus and lyrnessus where the greeks capture the queen briseis and killed tenes a son of apollo as well as priams son troilus in the sanctuary of apollo thymbraios however the romance between troilus and chryseis described in geoffrey chaucers troilus and criseyde and in william shakespeares troilus and cressida is a medieval invention in dares phrygius account of the destruction of troy the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe as well as in older accounts troilus was a young trojan prince the youngest of king priams and hecubas five legitimate sons or according other sources another son of apollo despite his youth he was one of the main trojan war leaders a horse fighter or chariot fighter according to homer prophecies linked troilus fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him yet achilles struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth  who refusing to yield instead found himself decapitated upon an altaromphalos of apollo thymbraios later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an overardent lovers embrace in this version of the myth achilles death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents had troilus lived to adulthood the first vatican mythographer claimed troy would have been invincible however the motif is older and found already in plautus bacchides in the iliad homers iliad is the most famous narrative of achilles deeds in the trojan war achilles wrath μῆνις ἀχιλλέως mênis achilléōs is the central theme of the poem the first two lines of the iliad read the homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decadelong war and does not narrate achilles death it begins with achilles withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by agamemnon the commander of the achaean forces agamemnon has taken a woman named chryseis as his slave her father chryses a priest of apollo begs agamemnon to return her to him agamemnon refuses and apollo sends a plague amongst the greeks the prophet calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless achilles vows to protect him achilles does so and calchas declares that chryseis must be returned to her father agamemnon consents but then commands that achilles slave briseis the daughter of briseus be brought to him to replace chryseis angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away and as he says later because he loves briseis with the urging of his mother thetis achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces at the same time burning with rage over agamemnons theft achilles prays to thetis to convince zeus to help the trojans gain ground in the war so that he may regain his honour as the battle turns against the greeks thanks to the influence of zeus nestor declares that the trojans are winning because agamemnon has angered achilles and urges the king to appease the warrior agamemnon agrees and sends odysseus and two other chieftains ajax and phoenix they promise that if achilles returns to battle agamemnon will return the captive briseis and other gifts achilles rejects all agamemnon offers him and simply urges the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do the trojans led by hector subsequently push the greek army back toward the beaches and assault the greek ships with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction patroclus leads the myrmidons into battle wearing achilles armour though achilles remains at his camp patroclus succeeds in pushing the trojans back from the beaches but is killed by hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of troy after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus the son of nestor achilles grieves over his beloved companions death his mother thetis comes to comfort the distraught achilles she persuades hephaestus to make new armour for him in place of the armour that patroclus had been wearing which was taken by hector the new armour includes the shield of achilles described in great detail in the poem enraged over the death of patroclus achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector achilles even engages in battle with the river god scamander who has become angry that achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed the god tries to drown achilles but is stopped by hera and hephaestus zeus himself takes note of achilles rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles can defy fate itself finally achilles finds his prey achilles chases hector around the wall of troy three times before athena in the form of hectors favorite and dearest brother deiphobus persuades hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face after hector realizes the trick he knows the battle is inevitable wanting to go down fighting he charges at achilles with his only weapon his sword but misses accepting his fate hector begs achilles not to spare his life but to treat his body with respect after killing him achilles tells hector it is hopeless to expect that of him declaring that my rage my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw  such agonies you have caused me achilles then kills hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot after having a dream where patroclus begs achilles to hold his funeral achilles hosts a series of funeral games in honour of his companion at the onset of his duel with hector achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky which comes on in the autumn orions dog sirius a sign of evil during the cremation of patroclus he is compared to hesperus the eveningwestern star venus while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until phosphorus the morningeastern star also venus has set descended with the assistance of the god hermes argeiphontes hectors father priam goes to achilles tent to plead with achilles for the return of hectors body so that he can be buried achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th in the tradition of niobes offspring the poem ends with a description of hectors funeral with the doom of troy and achilles himself still to come later epic accounts fighting penthesilea and memnon the aethiopis 7th century bc and a work named posthomerica composed by quintus of smyrna in the fourth century ce relate further events from the trojan war when penthesilea queen of the amazons and daughter of ares arrives in troy priam hopes that she will defeat achilles after his temporary truce with priam achilles fights and kills the warrior queen only to grieve over her death later initially taken aback he did not fight as intensely as usual once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life he refocused and killed her following the death of patroclus nestors son antilochus becomes achilles closest companion when memnon son of the dawn goddess eos and king of ethiopia slays antilochus achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield killing memnon consequently eos will not let the sun rise until zeus persuades her the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus except that memnon unlike hector was also the son of a goddess many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the iliads description of the death of patroclus and achilles reaction to it the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic aethiopis which was composed after the iliad possibly in the 7th century bc the aethiopis is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors achilles and patroclus the exact nature of achilles relationship with patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times in the iliad it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus had sexual relations although there is no direct evidence in the text of the iliad that achilles and patroclus were lovers this theory was expressed by some later authors commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures in 5thcentury bc athens the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of paiderasteia which is the relationship between an older male and a younger one usually a teenager in patroclus and achilles case achilles would have been the younger as patroclus is usually seen as his elder in platos symposium the participants in a dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were a couple phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover however ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to achilles and patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship  death the death of achilles even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources is a complex one with many different versions starting with the oldest account in the iliad book xxii hector predicts with his last dying breath that paris and apollo will slay him at the scaean gates leading to troy with an arrow to the heel according to statius in book xxiii the sad spirit of dead patroclus visits achilles just as he drifts off into slumber requesting that his bones be placed with those of achilles in his golden vase a gift of his mother in the odyssey book xi odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades one of these is achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead but achilles then asks odysseus of his sons exploits in the trojan war and odysseus tells him of neoptolemus actions in the odyssey book xxiv we read dead king agamemnons ghostly account of his death achilles funeral pyre bleached bones had been mixed with those of patroclus and put into his mothers golden vase also the bones of antilocus who had become closer to achilles than any other following patroclus death were separately enclosed and the customary funeral games of a hero were performed and a massive tomb or mound was built on the hellespont for approaching seagoers to celebrate achilles was represented in the aethiopis as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube another version of achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses polyxena achilles asks priam for polyxenas hand in marriage priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the worlds greatest warrior but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles paris who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with a divine arrow killing him according to some accounts he had married medea in life so that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades  as hera promised thetis in apollonius argonautica 3rd century bc fate of achilles armour achilles armour was the object of a feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax ajax the greater they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners who after considering both mens presentations decided odysseus was more deserving of the armour furious ajax cursed odysseus which earned him the ire of athena who temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep thinking them his comrades after a while when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep he was so ashamed that he committed suicide odysseus eventually gave the armour to neoptolemus the son of achilles when odysseus encounters the shade of ajax much later in the house of hades odyssey 11543566 ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to odysseus the armour they fought for was made by hephaestus and thus much stronger and more beautiful than any armour a mortal could craft thetis had the gear made for achilles because his first set was worn by patroclus when he went to battle and taken by hector when he killed patroclus the shield of achilles was also made by the fire god his legendary spear was given to him by his mentor chiron before he participated in the trojan war it was called the pelian spear which allegedly no other man could wield a relic claimed to be achilles bronzeheaded spear was preserved for centuries in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis lycia a port on the pamphylian gulf the city was visited in 333 bc by alexander the great who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the iliad with him but his court biographers do not mention the spear however it was shown in the time of pausanias in the 2nd century ce achilles ajax and a game of petteia numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions at some point in the war achilles and ajax were playing a board game petteia they were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle the trojans attacked and reached the heroes who were saved only by an intervention of athena worship and heroic cult right the tomb of achilles extant throughout antiquity in troad was venerated by thessalians but also by persian expeditionary forces as well as by alexander the great and the roman emperor caracalla achilles cult was also to be found at other places e g on the island of astypalaea in the sporades in sparta which had a sanctuary in elis and in achilles homeland thessaly as well as in the magna graecia cities of tarentum locri and croton accounting for an almost panhellenic cult to the hero the cult of achilles is illustrated in the 500 bc polyxena sarcophagus which depicts the sacrifice of polyxena near the tumulus of achilles strabo 13132 also suggested that such a cult of achilles existed in troad the spread and intensity of the heros veneration among the greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the pontus euxinus todays black sea appears to have been remarkable an archaic cult is attested for the milesian colony of olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the black sea today identified with snake island ukrainian зміїний zmiinyi near kiliya ukraine early dedicatory inscriptions from the greek colonies on the black sea graffiti and inscribed clay disks these possibly being votive offerings from olbia the area of berezan island and the tauric chersonese attest the existence of a heroic cult of achilles from the sixth century bc onwards the cult was still thriving in the third century ce when dedicatory stelae from olbia refer to an achilles pontárchēs ποντάρχης roughly lord of the sea or of the pontus euxinus who was invoked as a protector of the city of olbia venerated on par with olympian gods such as the local apollo prostates hermes agoraeus or poseidon pliny the elder 2379 ad in his natural history mentions a port of the achæi and an island of achilles famous for the tomb of that man portus achaeorum insula achillis tumulo eius viri clara situated somewhat nearby olbia and the dnieperbug estuary furthermore at 125 roman miles from this island he places a peninsula which stretches forth in the shape of a sword obliquely called dromos achilleos ἀχιλλέως δρόμος achilléōs drómos the racecourse of achilles and considered the place of the heros exercise or of games instituted by him this last feature of plinys account is considered to be the iconic spit called today tendra or kosa tendra and kosa djarilgatch situated between the mouth of the dnieper and karkinit bay but which is hardly 125 roman miles 185 km away from the dnieperbug estuary as pliny states to the racecourse he gives a length of 80 miles 120 km whereas the spit measures 70 km today in the following chapter of his book pliny refers to the same island as achillea and introduces two further names for it leuce or macaron from greek νῆσος μακαρῶν island of the blest the present day measures he gives at this point seem to account for an identification of achillea or leuce with todays snake island plinys contemporary pomponius mela 43 ad tells that achilles was buried on an island named achillea situated between the borysthenes and the ister adding to the geographical confusion ruins of a square temple measuring 30 meters to a side possibly that dedicated to achilles were discovered by captain kritzikly критский николай дмитриевич in 1823 on snake island a second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple a fifth century bc blackglazed lekythos inscription found on the island in 1840 reads glaukos son of poseidon dedicated me to achilles lord of leuke in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century bc a statue is dedicated to achilles lord of leuke by a citizen of olbia while in a further dedication the city of olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the islands cult again suggesting its quality as a place of a supraregional hero veneration the heroic cult dedicated to achilles on leuce seems to go back to an account from the lost epic aethiopis according to which after his untimely death thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical λεύκη νῆσος leúkē nêsos white island already in the fifth century bc pindar had mentioned a cult of achilles on a bright island φαεννά νᾶσος phaenná nâsos of the black sea while in another of his works pindar would retell the story of the immortalized achilles living on a geographically indefinite island of the blest together with other heroes such as his father peleus and cadmus well known is the connection of these mythological fortunate isles μακαρῶν νῆσοι makárôn nêsoi or the homeric elysium with the stream oceanus which according to greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the euxine with it guy hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by alcaeus speaking of achilles lord of scythia and the opposition of north and south as evoked by achilles fight against the aethiopian prince memnon who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother eos after his death the periplus of the euxine sea 130 ad gives the following details the greek geographer dionysius periegetes who likely lived during the first century ce wrote that the island was called leuce because the wild animals which live there are white it is said that there in leuce island reside the souls of achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour similarly others relate the islands name to its white cliffs snakes or birds dwelling there pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame in this island there is also achilles temple and his statue leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing pausanias reports that the delphic pythia sent a lord of croton to be cured of a chest wound ammianus marcellinus attributes the healing to waters aquae on the island strabo mentioned that the cape of the racecourse of achilles was sacred to achilles and although it was treeless was called alsos ἄλσος alsos in greek means grove a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters were dedicated to achilles herodotus pliny the elder and strabo reported on the existence of a town achílleion ἀχίλλειον built by settlers from mytilene in the sixth century bc close to the heros presumed burial mound in the troad later attestations point to an achílleion in messenia according to stephanus byzantinus and an achílleios ἀχίλλειος in laconia nicolae densuşianu recognized a connection to achilles in the names of aquileia and of the northern arm of the danube delta called chilia presumably from an older achileii though his conclusion that leuce had sovereign rights over the black sea evokes modern rather than archaic sealaw the kings of epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son neoptolemus alexander the great son of the epirote princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy in ad 216 the roman emperor caracalla while on his way to war against parthia emulated alexander by holding games around achilles tumulus reception during antiquity in greek tragedy the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles given the title achilleis by modern scholars the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo punctures his heel extant fragments of the achilleis and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play the first part of the achilleis trilogy the myrmidons focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon only a few lines survive today in platos symposium phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles being the younger and more beautiful of the two was the beloved who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge him the tragedian sophocles also wrote the lovers of achilles a play with achilles as the main character only a few fragments survive towards the end of the 5th century bc a more negative view of achilles emerges in greek drama euripides refers to achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in hecuba electra and iphigenia in aulis in greek philosophy zeno the philosopher zeno of elea centred one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between swiftfooted achilles and a tortoise by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start and therefore that motion and change were impossible as a student of the monist parmenides and a member of the eleatic school zeno believed time and motion to be illusions plato in hippias minor a socratic dialogue attributed to plato an arrogant man named hippias argues with socrates the two get into a discussion about lying they decide that a person who is intentionally false must be better than a person who is unintentionally false on the basis that someone who lies intentionally must understand the subject about which they are lying socrates uses various analogies discussing athletics and the sciences to prove his point the two also reference homer extensively socrates and hippias agree that odysseus who concocted a number of lies throughout the odyssey and other stories in the trojan war cycle was false intentionally achilles like odysseus told numerous falsehoods hippias believes that achilles was a generally honest man while socrates believes that achilles lied for his own benefit the two argue over whether it is better to lie on purpose or by accident socrates eventually abandons homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point someone who does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally in roman and medieval literature the romans who traditionally traced their lineage to troy took a highly negative view of achilles virgil refers to achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men while horace portrays achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children other writers such as catullus propertius and ovid represent a second strand of disparagement with an emphasis on achilles erotic career this strand continues in latin accounts of the trojan war by writers such as dictys cretensis and dares phrygius and in benoît de saintemaures roman de troie and guido delle colonnes historia destructionis troiae which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the matter of troy until the 17th century achilles was described by the byzantine chronicler leo the deacon not as hellene but as scythian while according to the byzantine author john malalas his army was made up of a tribe previously known as myrmidons and later as bulgars in modern literature and arts literature visual arts music achilles has been frequently the subject of operas ballets and related genres film and television achilles has been portrayed in the following films and television series architecture namesakes gallery references further reading external links abraham lincoln categories abraham lincoln 1809 births 1865 deaths 1865

indiana it had just been admitted to the union as a free nonslaveholding state except that though no new enslaved people were allowed  currently enslaved individuals remained somarch 2024 in 1860

itinerant teachers it included two short stints in kentucky where he learned to read but probably not to write at age seven and in indiana where due to farm chores he attended school only sporadically for a total of fewer than 12 months in aggregate by age 15 he remained an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning family neighbors and schoolmates recalled that his reading included the king james bible aesops fables john bunyans the pilgrims progress daniel defoes robinson crusoe and the autobiography of benjamin franklin despite being selfeducated lincoln was the recipient of

sickness outbreak several members of the extended lincoln family including abraham moved west to illinois a free state and settled in macon county abraham then became increasingly distant from thomas

new salem illinois for six years lincoln and some friends took goods including live hogs by flatboat to new orleans louisiana where he first witnessed slavery marriage and children speculation persists that lincolns first romantic interest was ann rutledge whom he met when he moved to new salem witness testimony given decades afterward showed a lack of any specific recollection of a romance between the two rutledge died on august 25 1835 most likely of typhoid fever saying that he could not bear the idea of rain falling on anns grave lincoln sunk into a serious episode of depression and this gave rise to speculation that he had been in love with her in the early 1830s he met mary owens from kentucky late in 1836 lincoln agreed to a match with owens if she returned to new salem owens arrived that november and he courted her for a time however they both had second thoughts on august 16 1837 he wrote owens a letter saying he would not blame her if she ended the relationship and she

lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own in fact lincolns law partner william h herndon would grow irritated when lincoln brought his children to the law office their father it seemed was often too absorbed in his work to notice his childrens behavior herndon recounted i have felt many and many a time that i wanted to wring their little necks and yet out of respect for lincoln i kept my mouth shut lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done the deaths of their sons eddie and willie had profound effects on both parents lincoln suffered from melancholy a condition now thought to be clinical depression later in life mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons and in 1875 robert committed her to an asylum early career and militia service during 1831 and 1832 lincoln worked at a general store in new salem illinois in 1832 he declared his candidacy for the illinois house of representatives but interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the illinois militia during the black hawk war when lincoln returned home from the black hawk war he planned to become a blacksmith but instead formed a partnership with 21yearold william berry with whom he purchased a new salem general store on credit because a license was required to sell customers single beverages berry obtained bartending licenses for 7 each for lincoln and himself and in 1833 the lincolnberry general store became a tavern as well as licensed bartenders lincoln and berry were able to sell spirits including liquor for 12 cents a pint they offered a wide range of alcoholic beverages as well as food including takeout dinners but berry became an alcoholic was often too drunk to work and lincoln ended up running the store by himself although the economy

canal and later was a canal commissioner he voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males but adopted a free soil stance opposing both slavery and abolition in 1837 he declared the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils he echoed henry clays support for the american colonization society which advocated a program of abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in liberia he was admitted to the illinois bar on september 9 1836 and moved to springfield and began to practice law under john t stuart mary todds cousin lincoln emerged as a formidable trial combatant during crossexaminations and closing arguments he partnered several years with stephen t logan and in 1844 began his practice with william herndon a studious young man on january 27 1838 abraham lincoln then 28 years old delivered his first major speech at the lyceum in springfield illinois after the murder of newspaper editor elijah parish lovejoy in alton lincoln warned that no transatlantic military giant could ever crush the us as a nation it cannot come from abroad if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher said lincoln prior to that on april 28 1836 an innocent black man francis mcintosh was burned alive in st louis missouri zann gill describes how these two murders set off a chain reaction that ultimately prompted abraham lincoln to run for president us house of representatives 18471849 true to his record lincoln professed to friends in 1861 to be an old line whig a disciple of henry clay their party favored economic modernization in banking tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads and urbanization in 1843 lincoln sought the whig nomination for illinoiss 7th district seat in the us house of representatives he was defeated by john j hardin though he prevailed with the party in limiting hardin to one term lincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining the nomination in 1846 but also won the election he was the only whig in the illinois delegation but as dutiful as any participated in almost all votes and made speeches that toed the party line he was assigned to the committee on post office and post roads and the committee on expenditures in the war department lincoln teamed with joshua r giddings on a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners enforcement to capture fugitive slaves and a popular vote on the matter he dropped the bill when it eluded whig support political views on foreign and military policy lincoln spoke against the mexicanamerican war which he imputed to president james k polks desire for military glory  that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood he supported the wilmot proviso a failed proposal to ban slavery in any us territory won from mexico lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions the war had begun with a killing of american soldiers by mexican cavalry patrol in disputed territory and polk insisted that mexican soldiers had invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellowcitizens on our own soil lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil the resolution was ignored in both congress and the national papers and it cost lincoln political support in his district one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln lincoln later regretted some of his statements especially his attack on presidential warmaking powers lincoln had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the house realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency he supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election taylor won and lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed commissioner of the united states general land office the administration offered to appoint him secretary or governor of the oregon territory as consolation this distant territory was a democratic stronghold and acceptance of the post would have disrupted his legal and political career in illinois so he declined and resumed his law practice prairie lawyer in his springfield practice lincoln handled every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer twice a year he appeared for 10 consecutive weeks in county seats in the midstate county courts this continued for 16 years lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nations western expansion particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges as a riverboat man lincoln initially favored those interests but ultimately represented whoever hired him he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in hurd v rock island bridge company a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge in 1849 he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water the idea was never commercialized but it made lincoln the only president to hold a patent lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in 175 cases he was sole counsel in 51 cases of which 31 were decided in his favor from 1853 to 1860 one of his largest clients was the illinois central railroad his legal reputation gave rise to the nickname honest abe lincoln argued in an 1858 criminal trial defending william duff armstrong who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker the case is famous for lincolns use of a fact established by judicial notice to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness after an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac showing the moon was at a low angle drastically reducing visibility armstrong was acquitted leading up to his presidential campaign lincoln elevated his profile in an 1859 murder case with his defense of simeon quinn peachy harrison who was a third cousin harrison was also the grandson of lincolns political opponent rev peter cartwright harrison was charged with the murder of greek crafton who as he lay dying of his wounds confessed to cartwright that he had provoked harrison lincoln angrily protested the judges initial decision to exclude cartwrights testimony about the confession as inadmissible hearsay lincoln argued that the testimony involved a dying declaration and was not subject to the hearsay rule instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as expected the judge a democrat reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence resulting in harrisons acquittal republican politics 18541860 emergence as republican leader the debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slaveholding south and the free north with the failure of the compromise of 1850 a legislative package designed to address the issue in his 1852 eulogy for clay lincoln highlighted the latters support for gradual emancipation and opposition to both extremes on the slavery issue as the slavery debate in the nebraska and kansas territories became particularly acrimonious illinois senator stephen a douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery the legislation alarmed many northerners who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that could result but douglass kansasnebraska act narrowly passed congress in may 1854 lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his peoria speech of october 1854 lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency he said the kansas act had a declared indifference but as i must think a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery i cannot but hate it i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world lincolns attacks on the kansasnebraska act marked his return to political life nationally the whigs were irreparably split by the kansasnebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue reflecting on the demise of his party lincoln wrote in 1855 i think i am a whig but others say there are no whigs and that i am an abolitionist  i do no more than oppose the extension of slavery the new republican party was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery drawing from the antislavery wing of the whig party and combining free soil liberty and antislavery democratic party members lincoln resisted early republican entreaties fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the whigs though he lamented his partys growing closeness with the nativist know nothing movement in 1854 lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature but declined to take his seat the years elections showed the strong opposition to the kansasnebraska act and in the aftermath lincoln sought election to the united states senate at that time senators were elected by the state legislature after leading in the first six rounds of voting he was unable to obtain a majority lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull trumbull was an antislavery democrat and had received few votes in the earlier ballots his supporters also antislavery democrats had vowed not to support any whig lincolns decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbulls antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate joel aldrich matteson 1856 campaign violent political confrontations in kansas continued and opposition to the kansasnebraska act remained strong throughout the north as the 1856 elections approached lincoln joined the republicans and attended the bloomington convention which formally established the illinois republican party the convention platform endorsed congresss right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of kansas as a free state lincoln gave the final speech of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the union at the june 1856 republican national convention though lincoln received support to run as vice president john c frémont and william dayton were on the ticket which lincoln supported throughout illinois the democrats nominated former secretary of state james buchanan and the knownothings nominated former whig president millard fillmore buchanan prevailed while republican william henry bissell won election as governor of illinois and lincoln became a leading republican in illinois dred scott v sandford dred scott was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a territory that was free as a result of the missouri compromise after scott was returned to the slave state he petitioned a federal court for his freedom his petition was denied in dred scott v sandford 1857 in his opinion supreme court chief justice roger b taney wrote that black people were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution and that the missouri compromise was unconstitutional for infringing upon slave owners property rights while many democrats hoped that dred scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories the decision sparked further outrage in the north lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power he argued the decision was at variance with the declaration of independence he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect they believed all men were equal in certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness lincolndouglas debates and cooper union speech in 1858 douglas was up for reelection in the us senate and lincoln hoped to defeat him many in the party felt that a former whig should be nominated in 1858 and lincolns 1856 campaigning and support of trumbull had earned him a favor some eastern republicans supported douglas for his opposition to the lecompton constitution and admission of kansas as a slave state many illinois republicans resented this eastern interference for the first time illinois republicans held a convention to agree upon a senate candidate and lincoln won the nomination with little opposition lincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal after his nomination he delivered his house divided speech with the biblical reference mark 325 a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolvedi do not expect the house to fallbut i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other the speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion the stage was then set for the election of the illinois legislature which would in turn select lincoln or douglas when informed of lincolns nomination douglas stated lincoln is the strong man of the party  and if i beat him my victory will be hardly won the senate campaign featured seven debates between lincoln and douglas these were the most famous political debates in american history they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism and he accused douglas of distorting the founding fathers premise that all men are created equal in his freeport doctrine douglas argued that despite the dred scott decision which he claimed to support local settlers under the doctrine of popular sovereignty should be free to choose whether to allow slavery within their territory and he accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists lincolns argument assumed a moral tone as he claimed that douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery douglass argument was more legal in nature claiming that lincoln was defying the authority of the us supreme court as exercised in the dred scott decision though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas however lincolns articulation of the issues had given him a national political presence in may 1859 lincoln purchased the illinois staatsanzeiger a germanlanguage newspaper that was consistently supportive most of the states 130000 german americans voted for democrats but the germanlanguage paper mobilized republican support in the aftermath of the 1858 election newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as a potential republican presidential candidate rivaled by william h seward salmon p chase edward bates and simon cameron while lincoln was popular in the midwest he lacked support in the northeast and was unsure whether to seek the office in january 1860 lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the presidential nomination if offered and in the following months several local papers endorsed his candidacy over the coming months lincoln was tireless making nearly fifty speeches along the campaign trail by the quality and simplicity of his rhetoric he quickly became the champion of the republican party however despite his overwhelming support in the midwestern united states he was less appreciated in the east horace greeley editor of the new york tribune at that time wrote up an unflattering account of lincolns compromising position on slavery and his reluctance to challenge the courts dred scott ruling which was promptly used against him by his political rivals on february 27 1860 powerful new york republicans invited lincoln to give a speech at cooper union in which he argued that the founding fathers of the united states had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery he insisted that morality required opposition to slavery and rejected any groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly but lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership which brought him into contention journalist noah brooks reported no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience historian david herbert donald described the speech as a superb political move for an unannounced presidential aspirant appearing in sewards home state sponsored by a group largely loyal to chase lincoln shrewdly made no reference to either of these republican rivals for the nomination in response to an inquiry about his ambitions lincoln said the taste is in my mouth a little 1860 presidential election on may 910 1860 the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur lincolns followers organized a campaign team led by david davis norman judd leonard swett and jesse dubois and lincoln received his first endorsement exploiting his embellished frontier legend clearing land and splitting fence rails lincolns supporters adopted the label of the rail candidate in 1860 lincoln described himself i am in height six feet four inches nearly lean in flesh weighing on an average one hundred and eighty pounds dark complexion with coarse black hair and gray eyes michael martinez wrote about the effective imaging of lincoln by his campaign at times he was presented as the plaintalking rail splitter and at other times he was honest abe unpolished but trustworthy on may 18 at the republican national convention in chicago lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot beating candidates such as seward and chase a former democrat hannibal hamlin of maine was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket lincolns success depended on his campaign team his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff pennsylvania put him over the top led by the states iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support lincolns managers had focused on this delegation while honoring lincolns dictate to make no contracts that will bind me as the slave power tightened its grip on the national government most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party throughout the 1850s lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession when douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the democratic convention they opposed douglass position on popular sovereignty and selected incumbent vice president john c breckinridge as their candidate a group of former whigs and know nothings formed the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee lincoln and douglas competed for votes in the north while bell and breckinridge primarily found support in the south before the republican convention the lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization the wide awakes which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln and rallied supporters for lincoln as douglas and the other candidates campaigned lincoln gave no speeches relying on the enthusiasm of the republican party the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north and produced an abundance of campaign posters leaflets and newspaper editorials republican speakers focused first on the party platform and second on lincolns life story emphasizing his childhood poverty the goal was to demonstrate the power of free labor which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts the republican partys production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition a chicago tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed lincolns life and sold 100000200000 copies though he did not give public appearances many sought to visit him and write him in the runup to the election he took an office in the illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention he also hired john george nicolay as his personal secretary who would remain in that role during the presidency on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected the 16th president he was the first republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the north and west no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 southern slave states and he won only two of 996 counties in all the southern states an omen of the impending civil war lincoln received 1866452 votes or 398 of the total in a fourway race carrying the free northern states as well as california and oregon his victory in the electoral college was decisive lincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents presidency 18611865 secession and inauguration the south was outraged by lincolns election and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the union before he took office in march 1861 on december 20 1860 south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession by february 1 1861 florida mississippi alabama georgia louisiana and texas followed six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation the confederate states of america and adopted a constitution the upper south and border states delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas initially rejected the secessionist appeal president buchanan and presidentelect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy declaring secession illegal the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february 9 1861 attempts at compromise followed but lincoln and the republicans rejected the proposed crittenden compromise as contrary to the partys platform of freesoil in the territories lincoln said i will suffer death before i consent  to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right lincoln supported the corwin amendment to the constitution which passed congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when lincoln took office that doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed on march 4 1861 in his first inaugural address lincoln said that because he holds such a provision to now be implied constitutional law i have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable a few weeks before the war lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution on february 11 1861 lincoln gave a particularly emotional farewell address upon leaving springfield he would never again return to springfield alive lincoln traveled east in a special train due to secessionist plots a thenunprecedented attention to security was given to him and his train en route to his inauguration lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north the presidentelect evaded suspected assassins in baltimore on february 23 1861 he arrived in disguise in washington dc which was placed under substantial military guard lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension indeed the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists i believe i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between north and south stating one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended this is the only substantial dispute the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature the failure of the peace conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible by march 1861 no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms meanwhile lincoln and the republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated in his second inaugural address lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came civil war major robert anderson commander of the unions fort sumter in charleston south carolina sent a request for provisions to washington and lincolns order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war on april 12 1861 confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter and began the fight historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and overlooking southern unionist opposition to an invasion william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on a volcano and that the south was preparing for war donald concludes his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on fort sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood but he had also vowed not to surrender the forts the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot they did just that on april 15 lincoln called on the states to send a total of 75000 volunteer troops to recapture forts protect washington and preserve the union which in his view remained intact despite the seceding states this call forced states to choose sides virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of richmond as the confederate capital despite its exposure to union lines north carolina tennessee and arkansas followed over the following two months secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland but did not prevail kentucky remained neutral the fort sumter attack rallied americans north of the masondixon line to defend the nation as states sent union regiments south on april 19 baltimore mobs in control of the rail links attacked union troops who were changing trains local leaders groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the army responded by arresting local maryland officials lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in an effort to protect the troops trying to reach washington john merryman one maryland official hindering the us troop movements petitioned supreme court chief justice roger b taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus in june in ex parte merryman taney not ruling on behalf of the supreme court issued the writ believing that article i section 9 of the constitution authorized only congress and not the president to suspend it but lincoln invoked nonacquiescence and persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas union military strategy lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the union military strategy he responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as commanderinchief by exercising unprecedented authority he expanded his war powers imposed a blockade on confederate ports disbursed funds before appropriation by congress suspended habeas corpus and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers lincoln gained the support of congress and the northern public for these actions lincoln also had to reinforce union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict it was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery on august 6 1861 lincoln signed the confiscation act which authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederates the law had little practical effect but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery in august 1861 general john c frémont the 1856 republican presidential nominee without consulting washington issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels lincoln canceled the illegal proclamation as politically motivated and lacking military necessity as a result union enlistments from maryland kentucky and missouri increased by over 40000 internationally lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the confederacy he relied on his combative secretary of state william seward while working closely with senate foreign relations committee chairman charles sumner in the 1861 trent affair which threatened war with great britain the us navy illegally intercepted a british mail ship the trent on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys britain protested vehemently while the us cheered lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats biographer james g randall dissected lincolns successful techniques lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the war department he tracked all phases of the effort consulting with governors and selecting generals based on their success their state and their party in january 1862 after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department lincoln replaced war secretary simon cameron with edwin stanton stanton centralized the war departments activities auditing and canceling contracts saving the federal government 17000000 stanton was a staunch unionist probusiness conservative democrat who gravitated toward the radical republican faction he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than did any other senior official stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together say thomas and hyman lincolns war strategy had two priorities ensuring that washington was welldefended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt decisive victory twice a week lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon occasionally mary prevailed on him to take a carriage ride concerned that he was working too hard for his edification lincoln relied upon a book by his chief of staff general henry halleck entitled elements of military art and science halleck was a disciple of the european strategist antoinehenri jomini lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points such as the mississippi river lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemys army rather than merely capturing territory in directing the unions war strategy lincoln valued the advice of gen winfield scott even after his retirement as commanding general of the united states army on june 2324 1862 lincoln made an unannounced visit to west point where he spent five hours consulting with scott regarding the handling of the civil war and the staffing of the war department general mcclellan after the union rout at bull run and winfield scotts retirement lincoln appointed major general george b mcclellan generalinchief mcclellan then took months to plan his virginia peninsula campaign mcclellans slow progress frustrated lincoln as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington mcclellan in turn blamed the failure of the campaign on lincolns reservation of troops for the capital in 1862 lincoln removed mcclellan for the generals continued inaction he elevated henry halleck in july and appointed john pope as head of the new army of virginia pope satisfied lincolns desire to advance on richmond from the north thus protecting washington from counterattack but pope was then soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac back to defend washington despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellans failure to reinforce pope lincoln restored him to command of all forces around washington two days after mcclellans return to command general robert e lees forces crossed the potomac river into maryland leading to the battle of antietam that battle a union victory was among the bloodiest in american history it facilitated lincolns emancipation proclamation in january mcclellan then resisted the presidents demand that he pursue lees withdrawing army while general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans and after the 1862 midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with ambrose burnside the appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on lincolns part against presidential advice burnside launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december desertions during 1863 came in the thousands and only increased after fredericksburg so lincoln replaced burnside with joseph hooker in the 1862 midterm elections the republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation high taxes rumors of corruption suspension of habeas corpus military draft law and fears that freed slaves would come north and undermine the labor market the emancipation proclamation gained votes for republicans in rural new england and the upper midwest but cost votes in the irish and german strongholds and in the lower midwest where many southerners had lived for generations in the spring of 1863 lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near the plans included attacks by hooker on lee north of richmond rosecrans on chattanooga grant on vicksburg and a naval assault on charleston hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may then resigned and was replaced by george meade meade followed lee north into pennsylvania and beat him in the gettysburg campaign but then failed to follow up despite lincolns demands at the same time grant captured vicksburg and gained control of the mississippi river splitting the far western rebel states emancipation proclamation

constitution which before 1865 was understood to reserve the issue to the individual states lincoln believed that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented because these territories would be admitted to the union as free states and free states would come to outnumber slave states he sought to persuade the states to agree to compensation for emancipating their slaves lincoln rejected major general john c frémonts august 1861 emancipation attempt as well as one by major general david hunter in may 1862 on the grounds that it was not within their power and might upset loyal border states enough for them to secede in june 1862 congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory which lincoln signed in july the confiscation act of 1862 was enacted providing court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional he felt such action could be taken only within the war powers of the commanderinchief which he planned to exercise on july 22 1862 lincoln reviewed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet peace

millions implored lincoln to embrace emancipation in a public letter of august 22 1862 lincoln replied to greeley writing that while he personally wished all men could be free his first obligation as president was to preserve the union when lincoln published his reply to greeley he had already decided to issue the preliminary emancipation proclamation and therefore had already chosen the third option he mentioned in his letter to greeley to free some of the slaves namely those in the states in rebellion some scholars therefore believe that his reply to greeley was disingenuous and was intended to reassure white people who would have opposed a war for emancipation that emancipation was merely a means to preserve the union on september 22 1862 lincoln issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation which announced that in states still in rebellion on january 1 1863 the slaves would be freed he spent the next 100 days between september 22 and january 1 preparing the army and the nation for emancipation while democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites at the same time during those 100 days lincoln made efforts to end the war with slavery intact suggesting that he still took seriously the first option he mentioned in his letter to greeley saving the union without freeing any slave but on january 1 1863 keeping his word lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation freeing the slaves in 10 states not then under union control with exemptions specified for areas under such control lincolns comment on signing the proclamation was i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper with the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective union armies advancing south enabled thousands of slaves to escape to freedom the emancipation proclamation having stated that freedmen would be received into the armed service of the united states enlisting these freedmen became official policy by the spring of 1863 lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers in a letter to tennessee military governor andrew johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops lincoln wrote the bare sight of fifty thousand armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once by the end of 1863 at lincolns direction general lorenzo thomas had enrolled twenty regiments of african americans from the mississippi valley gettysburg address 1863 lincoln spoke at the dedication of the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november 19 1863 in 272 words and three minutes lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal he defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain that the future of democracy would be assured and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth defying his prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what

porter general ulysses grants victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln responding to criticism of grant after shiloh lincoln had said i cant spare this man he fights with grant in command lincoln felt the union army could advance in multiple theaters while also including black troops meades failure to capture lees army after gettysburg and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to promote grant to supreme commander grant then assumed command of meades army lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in 1864 he arranged for an intermediary to inquire into grants political intentions and once assured that he had none lincoln promoted grant to the newly revived rank of lieutenant general a rank which had been unoccupied since george washington authorization for such a promotion with the advice and consent of the senate was provided by a new bill which lincoln signed the same day he submitted grants name to the senate his nomination was confirmed by the senate on march 2 1864 grant in 1864 waged the bloody overland campaign which exacted heavy losses on both sides when lincoln asked what grants plans were the persistent general replied i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer grants army moved steadily south lincoln traveled to grants headquarters at city point virginia to confer with grant and william tecumseh sherman lincoln reacted to union losses by mobilizing support throughout the north lincoln authorized grant to target infrastructureplantations railroads and bridgeshoping to weaken the souths morale and fighting ability he emphasized defeat of the confederate armies over destruction which was considerable for its own sake lincolns engagement became distinctly personal on one occasion in 1864 when confederate general jubal early raided washington dc legend has it that while lincoln watched from an exposed position union captain and future supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes jr shouted at him get down you damn fool before you get shot but this story is commonly regarded as apocryphal as grant continued to weaken lees forces efforts to discuss peace began confederate vice president stephens led a group meeting with lincoln seward and others at hampton roads lincoln refused to negotiate with the confederacy as a coequal his objective to end the fighting was not realized on april 1 1865 grant nearly encircled petersburg in a siege the confederate government evacuated richmond and lincoln visited the conquered capital on april 9 lee surrendered to grant at appomattox officially ending the war reelection lincoln ran for reelection in 1864 while uniting the main republican factions along with war democrats edwin m stanton and andrew johnson lincoln used conversation and his patronage powersgreatly expanded from peacetimeto build support and fend off the radicals efforts to replace him at its convention the republicans selected johnson as his running mate to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans lincoln ran under the label of the new union party grants bloody stalemates damaged lincolns reelection prospects and many republicans feared defeat lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope the pledge read as followsthis morning as for some days past it seems exceedingly probable that this administration will not be reelected then it will be my duty to so cooperate with the president elect as to save the union between the election and the inauguration as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure but their candidate mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform meanwhile lincoln emboldened grant with more troops and republican party support shermans capture of atlanta in september and david farraguts capture of mobile ended defeatism the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln the national union party was united by lincolns support for emancipation state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads on november 8 lincoln carried all but three states including 78 percent of union soldiers on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address in it he deemed the war casualties to be gods will historian mark noll places the speech among the small handful of semisacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world it is inscribed in the lincoln memorial lincoln said reconstruction reconstruction preceded the wars end as lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation and the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates were to be treated lincoln replied let em up easy lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states his main goal was to keep the union together so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame but on how to rebuild the nation as one lincoln led the moderates in reconstruction policy and was opposed by the radicals under rep thaddeus stevens sen charles sumner and sen benjamin wade who otherwise remained lincolns allies determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office and had not mistreated union prisoners if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance as southern states fell they needed leaders while their administrations were restored in tennessee and arkansas lincoln respectively appointed johnson and frederick steele as military governors in louisiana lincoln ordered general nathaniel p banks to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery democratic opponents accused lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the republicans political aspirations the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the 1864 wadedavis bill which lincoln vetoed the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from louisiana arkansas and tennessee lincolns appointments were designed to harness both moderates and radicals to fill chief justice taneys seat on the supreme court he named the radicals choice salmon p chase who lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies after implementing the emancipation proclamation lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment he declared that such an amendment would clinch the whole matter and by december 1863 an amendment was brought to congress the senate passed it on april 8 1864 but the first vote in the house of representatives fell short of the required twothirds majority passage became part of lincolns reelection platform and after his successful reelection the second attempt in the house passed on january 31 1865 with ratification it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december 6 1865 lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen he signed senator charles sumners freedmens bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves the law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen lincoln announced a reconstruction plan that involved shortterm military control pending readmission under the control of southern unionists historians agree that it is impossible to predict how reconstruction would have proceeded had lincoln lived biographers james g randall and richard current according to david lincove argue that eric foner argues that native americans lincolns relationship with native americans started before he was born with their killing of his grandfather in front of his sons including lincolns father thomas lincoln himself served as a captain in the state militia during the black hawk war but saw no combat lincoln used appointments to the indian bureau as a reward to supporters from minnesota and wisconsin while in office his administration faced difficulties guarding western settlers railroads and telegraphs from indian attacks on august 17 1862 the dakota war broke out in minnesota hundreds of settlers were killed 30000 were displaced from their homes and washington was deeply alarmed some feared incorrectly that it might represent a confederate conspiracy to start a war on the northwestern frontier lincoln ordered thousands of confederate prisoners of war sent by railroad to put down the uprising when the confederates protested forcing confederate prisoners to fight indians lincoln revoked the policy and none arrived in minnesota lincoln sent general john pope as commander of the new department of the northwest two weeks into the hostilities before he arrived the fond du lac band of chippewa sent lincoln a letter asking to go to war for the united states against the sioux so lincoln could send minnesotas troops to fight the south shortly after a mille lacs band chief offered the same at st cloud minnesota in it the chippewa specified they wanted to use the indigenous rules of warfare that meant there would be no prisoners of war no surrender no peace agreement lincoln did not accept the chippewa offer as he could not control the chippewa and women and children were considered legitimate casualties in native american warfare serving under gen pope was minnesota congressman henry h sibley minnesotas governor had made sibley a colonel united states volunteers to command the us force tasked with fighting the war and that eventually defeated little crows forces at the battle of wood lake the day the mdewakanton force surrendered at camp release a chippewa war council met at minnesotas capitol with another chippewa offer to lincoln to fight the siouxfebruary 2023 sibley ordered a military commission to review the actions of the captured to try those that had committed war crimes the legitimacy of military commissions trying opposing combatants had been established during the mexican war sibley thought he had 1620 of the men he wanted for trial while gen pope ordered all detained be tried 303 were given death sentences that were subject to presidential review lincoln ordered pope send all trial transcripts to washington where lincoln and two of his staff examined them lincoln realized the trials could be divided into two groups combat between combatants and combat against civiliansmarch 2024 the groups could be identified by their transcripts the first group all had three pages in length while the second group had more some up to twelve pagesmarch 2024 he placed 263 cases into the first group and commuted their sentences in the second group were forty cases one he commuted for becoming a states witness sibley dismissed another when proof surfaced exonerating the defendant the remaining 38 were executed in the largest mass hanging in us historymarch 2024 questions arose concerning three executions that have not been answered less than 4 months afterwards lincoln issued the lieber code which governed wartime conduct of the union army by defining command responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity congressman alexander ramsey told lincoln in 1864 he would have gotten more reelection support in minnesota had he executed all 303 of the mdewakanton lincoln responded i could not afford to hang men for votes the men whose sentences he commuted were sent to a military prison at davenport iowa some he released due to the efforts of bishop henry whipple whig theory of a presidency lincoln adhered to the whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to congress responsibility for legislating lincoln vetoed only four bills including the wadedavis bill with its harsh reconstruction program the 1862 homestead act made millions of acres of western governmentheld land available for purchase at low cost the 1862 morrill landgrant colleges act provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869 the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was enabled by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s in the selection and use of his cabinet lincoln employed the strengths of his opponents in a manner that emboldened his presidency lincoln commented on his thought process we need the strongest men of the party in the cabinet we needed to hold our own people together i had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men then i had no right to deprive the country of their services goodwin described the group in her biography as a team of rivals there were two measures passed to raise revenues for the federal government tariffs a policy with long precedent and a federal income tax in 1861 lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariffs following the first enacted by buchanan he also signed the revenue act of 1861 creating the first us income taxa flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above 800 usus the revenue act of 1862 adopted rates that increased with income the lincoln administration presided over the expansion of the federal governments economic influence in other areas the national banking act created the system of national banks the us issued paper currency for the first time known as greenbacksprinted in green on the reverse side in 1862 congress created the department of agriculture in response to rumors of a renewed draft the editors of the new york world and the journal of commerce published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others to corner the gold market lincoln attacked the media for such behavior and ordered a military seizure of the two papers which lasted for two days lincoln is largely responsible for the thanksgiving holiday thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in new england in the 17th century it had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates the prior proclamation had been during james madisons presidency 50 years earlier in 1863 lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be a day of thanksgiving in june 1864 lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park supreme court appointments lincolns philosophy on court nominations was that we cannot ask a man what he will do and if we should and he should answer us we should despise him for it therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known lincoln made five appointments to the supreme court noah haynes swayne was an antislavery lawyer who was committed to the union samuel freeman miller supported lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist david davis was lincolns campaign manager in 1860 and had served as a judge in the illinois court circuit where lincoln practiced democrat stephen johnson field a previous california supreme court justice provided geographic and political balance finally lincolns treasury secretary salmon p chase became chief justice lincoln believed chase was an able jurist would support reconstruction legislation and that his appointment united the republican party foreign policy lincoln named his main political rival william h seward as secretary of state and left most diplomatic issues in his portfolio however lincoln did select some top diplomats as part of his patronage policy he also closely watched the handling of the trent affair in late 1861 to make sure there was no escalation into a war with britain sewards main role was to keep britain and france from supporting the confederacy he was successful after indicating to britain and france that the union would declare war on them if they supported the south assassination john wilkes booth was a wellknown actor and a confederate spy from maryland though he never joined the confederate army he had contacts with the confederate secret service after attending lincolns last public address on april 11 1865 in which lincoln stated his preference that the franchise be conferred on some black men specifically on the very intelligent and on those who serve our cause as soldiers booth hatched a plot to assassinate the president when booth learned of the lincolns intent to attend a play with general grant he planned to assassinate lincoln and grant at fords theatre lincoln and his wife attended the play our american cousin on the evening of april 14 just five days after the union victory at the battle of appomattox courthouse at the last minute grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play at 1015 in the evening booth entered the back of lincolns theater box crept up from behind and fired at the back of lincolns head mortally wounding him lincolns guest major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth but booth stabbed him and escaped after being attended by doctor charles leale and two other doctors lincoln was taken across the street to petersen house after remaining in a coma for eight hours lincoln died at 722 in the morning on april 15 stanton saluted and said now he belongs to the ages lincolns body was placed in a flagwrapped coffin which was loaded into a hearse and escorted to the white house by union soldiers president johnson was sworn in later that same day two weeks later booth refusing to surrender was tracked to a farm in virginia he was mortally shot by sergeant boston corbett and died on april 26 secretary of war stanton had issued orders that booth be taken alive so corbett was initially arrested to be court martialed after a brief interview stanton declared him a patriot and dismissed the charge funeral and burial the late president lay in state first in the east room of the white house and then in the capitol rotunda from april 19 to 21 the caskets containing lincolns body and the body of his son willie traveled for three weeks on the lincoln special funeral train the train followed a circuitous route from washington dc to springfield illinois stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands bonfires and hymn singing or in silent grief poet walt whitman composed when lilacs last in the dooryard bloomd to eulogize him one of four poems he wrote about lincoln african americans were especially moved they had lost their moses in a larger sense the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow but noted that some lincoln haters celebrated his death lincolns body was buried at oak ridge cemetery in springfield and now lies within the lincoln tomb religious and philosophical beliefs as a young man lincoln was a religious skeptic he was deeply familiar with the bible quoting and praising it he was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others he never made a clear profession of christian beliefs throughout his public career lincoln often quoted scripture his three most famous speechesthe house divided speech the gettysburg address and his second inauguraleach contain direct allusions to providence and quotes from scripture in the 1840s lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power with the death of his son edward in 1850 he more frequently expressed a dependence on god he never joined a church although he frequently attended first presbyterian church with his wife beginning in 1852 in the 1850s lincoln asserted his belief in providence in a general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence the death of his son willie in february 1862 may have caused him to look toward religion for solace after willies death he questioned the divine necessity of the wars severity he wrote at this time that god could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest yet the contest began and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day yet the contest proceeds lincoln did believe in an allpowerful god that shaped events and by 1865 was expressing that belief in major speeches by the end of the war he increasingly appealed to the almighty for solace and to explain events writing on april 4 1864 to a newspaper editor in kentucky i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me now at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected god alone can claim it whither it is tending seems plain if god now wills the removal of a great wrong and wills also that we of the north as well as you of the south shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of godthis spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address considered by some scholars as the greatest such address in american history and by lincoln himself as his own greatest speech or one of them at the very least lincoln explains therein that the cause purpose and result of the war was gods will lincolns frequent use of religious imagery and language toward the end of his life may have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences who were mostly evangelical protestants on the day lincoln was assassinated he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land health lincoln is believed to have had depression smallpox and malaria he took blue mass pills which contained mercury to treat constipation it is unknown to what extent this may have resulted in mercury poisoning several claims have been made that lincolns health was declining before the assassination these are often based on photographs of lincoln appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting it is also suspected that he might have had a rare genetic disease such as marfan syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b legacy republican values lincolns redefinition of republican values has been stressed by historians such as john patrick diggins harry v jaffa vernon burton eric foner and herman j belz lincoln called the declaration of independencewhich emphasized freedom and equality for allthe sheet anchor of republicanism beginning in the 1850s he did this at a time when the constitution which tolerated slavery was the focus of most political discourse diggins notes lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself in the 1860 cooper union speech instead of focusing on the legality of an argument he focused on the moral basis of republicanism his position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the constitution as essentially a contract among the states and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract furthermore it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state many soldiers and religious leaders from the north though felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs as a whig activist lincoln was a spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks infrastructure improvements and railroads in opposition to jacksonian democrats lincoln shared the sympathies that the jacksonians professed for the common man but he disagreed with the jacksonian view that the government should be divorced from economic enterprise nevertheless lincoln admired andrew jacksons steeliness as well as his patriotism according to historian sean wilentz william c harris found that lincolns reverence for the founding fathers the constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism james g randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform randall concludes that he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of socalled radicalism which involved abuse of the south hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders reunification of the states in lincolns first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy he denounced secession as anarchy and he explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints he said a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people the successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people viewed the country the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural these united states and other times in the singular the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century historical reputation in surveys of us scholars ranking presidents conducted since 1948 the top three presidents are generally lincoln washington and franklin delano roosevelt although the order varies between 1999 and 2011 lincoln john f kennedy and ronald reagan were the topranked presidents in eight public opinion surveys according to gallup a 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one while legal scholars placed him second after george washington lincolns assassination left him a national martyr he was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty republicans linked lincolns name to their party many though not all in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability historians have said he was a classical liberal in the 19thcentury sense allen c guelzo states that lincoln was a classical liberal democratan enemy of artificial hierarchy a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling and an american counterpart to mill cobden and bright whose portrait lincoln hung in his white house office sociologist barry schwartz argues that lincolns american reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the progressive era 19001920s when he emerged as one of americas most venerated heroes even among white southerners the high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington dc union nationalism as envisioned by lincoln helped lead america to the nationalism of theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson and franklin delano roosevelt in the new deal era liberals honored lincoln not so much as the selfmade man or the great war president but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state schwartz argues that in the 1930s and 1940s the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life during the great depression he argues lincoln served as a means for seeing the worlds disappointments for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful franklin d roosevelt preparing america for war used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan americans asked what would lincoln do however schwartz also finds that since world war ii lincolns symbolic power has lost relevance and this fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept in the cold war years lincolns image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes he had long been known as the great emancipator but by the late 1960s some african american intellectuals led by lerone bennett jr denied that lincoln deserved that title bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in 1968 he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality and proposed that freed slaves voluntarily move to another country the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government to emancipate them defenders of lincoln such as authors dirck and cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day and that he was a moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible dirck stated that few civil war scholars take bennett seriously pointing to his narrow political agenda and faulty research by the 1970s lincoln had become a hero to political conservativesapart from neoconfederates such as mel bradford who denounced his treatment of the white southfor his intense nationalism his support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of slavery his acting on lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers lincoln became a favorite of liberal intellectuals across the world barry schwartz wrote in 2009 that lincolns image suffered erosion fading prestige benign ridicule in the late 20th century on the other hand donald opined in his 1996 biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason in the 21st century president barack obama named lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using the lincoln bible for his inaugural ceremonies lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood almost always in a flattering light lincoln has been also admired by political figures outside the us including german political theorist karl marx indian independence leader mahatma gandhi former liberian president

classical theism aristotle ˈ arr ἀριστοτέλης aristotélēs aristotélɛːs 384322 bc was an ancient greek philosopher and polymath his writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the natural sciences philosophy linguistics economics politics psychology and the arts as the founder of the peripatetic school of philosophy in the lyceum in athens he began the wider aristotelian tradition that followed which set the groundwork for the development of modern science little is known about aristotles life he was born in the city of stagira in northern greece during the classical period his father nicomachus died when aristotle was a child and he was brought up by a guardian at 17 or 18 he joined platos academy in athens and remained there until the age of 37 347 bc shortly after plato died aristotle left athens and at the request of philip ii of macedon tutored his son alexander the great beginning in 343 bc he established a library in the lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication only around a third of his original output has survived none of it intended for publication aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him his teachings and methods of inquiry have had a significant impact across the world and remain a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion aristotles views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship the influence of his physical science extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance and was not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed he influenced judeoislamic philosophies during the middle ages as well as christian theology especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the catholic church aristotle was revered among medieval muslim scholars as the first teacher and among medieval christians like thomas aquinas as simply the philosopher while the poet dante called him the master of those who know his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic and were studied by medieval scholars such as peter abelard and jean buridan aristotles influence on logic continued well into the 19th century in addition his ethics although always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics life in general the details of aristotles life are not wellestablished the biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points aristotle was born in 384 bc in stagira chalcidice about 55 km 34 miles east of modernday thessaloniki his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon while he was young aristotle learned about biology and medical information which was taught by his father both of aristotles parents died when he was about thirteen and proxenus of atarneus became his guardian although little information about aristotles childhood has survived he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy at the age of seventeen or eighteen aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at platos academy he probably experienced the eleusinian mysteries as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the eleusinian mysteries to experience is to learn μαθεĩν aristotle remained in athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in 34847 bc the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academys direction after control passed to platos nephew speusippus although it is possible that he feared the antimacedonian sentiments in athens at that time and left before plato died aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor after the death of hermias aristotle travelled with his pupil theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon while in lesbos aristotle married pythias either hermiass adoptive daughter or niece they had a daughter whom they also named pythias in 343 bc aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon during aristotles time in the macedonian court he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings ptolemy and cassander aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and aristotles own attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric in one famous example he counsels alexander to be a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants by 335 bc aristotle had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira they had a son whom aristotle named after his father nicomachus if the suda en dash an uncritical compilation from the middle ages en dash is accurate he may also have had an erômenos palaephatus of abydus this period in athens between 335 and 323 bc is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics on the soul and poetics aristotle studied and made significant contributions to logic metaphysics mathematics physics biology botany ethics politics agriculture medicine dance and theatre near the end of his life alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexanders relationship with persia and persians a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexanders death but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death following alexanders death antimacedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled in 322 bc demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety prompting him to flee to his mothers family estate in chalcis on euboea at which occasion he was said to have stated i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy  a reference to athenss trial and execution of socrates he died in chalcis euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife theoretical philosophy logic with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until 19thcentury advances in mathematical logic kant stated in the critique of pure reason that with aristotle logic reached its completion organon what is today called aristotelian logic with its types of syllogism methods of logical argument aristotle himself would have labelled analytics the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics most of aristotles work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers the logical works of aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the organon around 40 bc by andronicus of rhodes or others among his followers the books are the order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotles writings it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the analytics and dialectics in the topics and sophistical refutations the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning the rhetoric is not conventionally included but it states that it relies on the topics metaphysics the word metaphysics appears to have been coined by the first century ad editor who assembled various small selections of aristotles works to the treatise we know by the name metaphysics aristotle called it first philosophy and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science physics as the contemplative theoretikē philosophy which is theological and studies the divine he wrote in his metaphysics 1026a16 substance aristotle examines the concepts of substance ousia and essence to ti ên einai the what it was to be in his metaphysics book vii and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form a philosophical theory called hylomorphism in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed for example the matter of a house is the bricks stones timbers etc or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia that let us define something as a house the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form immanent realism like his teacher plato aristotles philosophy aims at the universal aristotles ontology places the universal katholou in particulars kath hekaston things in the world whereas for plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate for aristotle form is still what phenomena are based on but is instantiated in a particular substance plato argued that all things have a universal form which could be either a property or a relation to other things when one looks at an apple for example one sees an apple and one can also analyse a form of an apple in this distinction there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple moreover one can place an apple next to a book so that one can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things for example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still a proper universal form aristotle disagreed with plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things in addition aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals where plato spoke of the forms as existing separately from the things that participate in them aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated so according to aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms potentiality and actuality concerning the nature of change kinesis and its causes as he outlines in his physics and on generation and corruption 319b320a he distinguishes comingtobe genesis also translated as generation from comingtobe is a change where the substrate of the thing that has undergone the change has itself changed in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dynamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form referring to potentiality this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else for example the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially dynamei a plant and if it is not prevented by something it will become a plant potentially beings can either act poiein or be acted upon paschein which can be either innate or learned for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innate  being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exercise  acting actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality because the end telos is the principle of every change and potentiality exists for the sake of the end actuality accordingly is the end referring then to the previous example it can be said that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do in summary the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also a final cause or end then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality with this definition of the particular substance ie matter and form aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes a man one since according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped how then is man a unity however according to aristotle the potential being matter and the actual one form are one and the same epistemology aristotles immanent realism means his epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world and rises to knowledge of the universal whereas for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction whereas plato relies on deduction from a priori principles natural philosophy aristotles natural philosophy spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics biology and other natural sciences in aristotles terminology natural philosophy is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences aristotles work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science however his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method for aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical metaphysics 1025b25 his practical science includes ethics and politics his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry his theoretical science covers physics mathematics and metaphysics physics five elements in his on generation and corruption aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by empedocles earth water air and fire to two of the four sensible qualities hot cold wet and dry in the empedoclean scheme all matter was made of the four elements in differing proportions aristotles scheme added the heavenly aether the divine substance of the heavenly spheres stars and planets motion aristotle describes two kinds of motion violent or unnatural motion such as that of a thrown stone in the physics 254b10 and natural motion such as of a falling object in on the heavens 300a20 in violent motion as soon as the agent stops causing it the motion stops also in other words the natural state of an object is to be at rest since aristotle does not address friction with this understanding it can be observed that as aristotle stated heavy objects on the ground say require more force to make them move and objects pushed with greater force move faster this would imply the equation incorrect in modern physics natural motion depends on the element concerned the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens while the 4 empedoclean elements move vertically up like fire as is observed or down like earth towards their natural resting places in the physics 215a25 aristotle effectively states a quantitative law that the speed v of a falling body is proportional say with constant c to its weight w and inversely proportional to the density ρ of the fluid in which it is falling aristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible opinions have varied on whether aristotle intended to state quantitative laws henri carteron held the extreme view that aristotles concept of force was basically qualitative but other authors reject this archimedes corrected aristotles theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places metal boats can float if they displace enough water floating depends in archimedes scheme on the mass and volume of the object not as aristotle thought its elementary composition aristotles writings on motion remained influential until the early modern period john philoponus in late antiquity and galileo in early modern period are said to have shown by experiment that aristotles claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect a contrary opinion is given by carlo rovelli who argues that aristotles physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity that of objects in the earths gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air in this system heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones whether friction is ignored or not and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium newtons forced motion corresponds to aristotles violent motion with its external agent but aristotles assumption that the agents effect stops immediately it stops acting eg the ball leaves the throwers hand has awkward consequences he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it resulting in the medieval theory of impetus four causes aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors his term aitia is traditionally translated as cause but it does not always refer to temporal sequence it might be better translated as explanation but the traditional rendering will be employed here optics aristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera obscura in problems book 15 the apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small aperture that let light in with it he saw that whatever shape he made the hole the suns image always remained circular he also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image chance and spontaneity according to aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things from what is spontaneous there is also more a specific kind of chance which aristotle names luck that only applies to peoples moral choices astronomy in astronomy aristotle refuted democrituss claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the suns rays pointing out partly correctly that if the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them he also wrote descriptions of comets including the great comet of 371 bc geology and natural sciences aristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations he stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one persons lifetime the geologist charles lyell noted that aristotle described such change including lakes that had dried up and deserts that had become watered by rivers giving as examples the growth of the nile delta since the time of homer and the upheaving of one of the aeolian islands previous to a volcanic eruption meteorologica lends its name to the modern study of meteorology but its modern usage diverges from the content of aristotles ancient treatise on meteors the ancient greeks did use the term for a range of atmospheric phenomena but also for earthquakes and volcanic eruptions aristotle proposed that the cause of earthquakes was a gas or vapor anathymiaseis that was trapped inside the earth and trying to escape following other greek authors anaxagoras empedocles and democritus aristotle also made many observations about the hydrologic cycle for example he made some of the earliest observations about desalination he observed early  and correctly  that when seawater is heated freshwater evaporates and that the oceans are then replenished by the cycle of rainfall and river runoff i have proved by experiment that salt water evaporated forms fresh and the vapor does not when it condenses condense into sea water again biology empirical research aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically and biology forms a large part of his writings he spent two years observing and describing the zoology of lesbos and the surrounding seas including in particular the pyrrha lagoon in the centre of lesbos his data in history of animals generation of animals movement of animals and parts of animals are assembled from his own observations statements given by people with specialized knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas his apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident his works on botany have been lost but two books on plants by his pupil theophrastus have survived aristotle reports on the sealife visible from observation on lesbos and the catches of fishermen he describes the catfish electric ray and frogfish in detail as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus his description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until the 19th century he gives accurate descriptions of the fourchambered forestomachs of ruminants and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark he notes that an animals structure is well matched to function so birds like the heron which live in marshes with soft mud and live by catching fish have a long neck long legs and a sharp spearlike beak whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet darwin too noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal but unlike aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution aristotles writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution but while aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridizations could occur he saw these as rare accidents for aristotle accidents like heat waves in winter must be considered distinct from natural causes he was thus critical of empedocless materialist theory of a survival of the fittest origin of living things and their organs and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results to put his views into modern terms he nowhere says that different species can have a common ancestor or that one kind can change into another or that kinds can become extinct scientific style aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense he used the ancient greek term pepeiramenoi to mean observations or at most investigative procedures like dissection in generation of animals he finds a fertilized hens egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryos heart beating inside instead he practiced a different style of science systematically gathering data discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals and inferring possible causal explanations from these this style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field such as genomics it does not result in the same certainty as experimental science but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed in this sense aristotles biology is scientific from the data he collected and documented aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the lifehistory features of the livebearing tetrapods terrestrial placental mammals that he studied among these correct predictions are the following brood size decreases with adult body mass so that an elephant has fewer young usually just one per brood than a mouse lifespan increases with gestation period and also with body mass so that elephants live longer than mice have a longer period of gestation and are heavier as a final example fecundity decreases with lifespan so longlived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than shortlived kinds like miceclear classification of living things aristotle distinguished about 500 species of animals arranging these in the history of animals in a graded scale of perfection a nonreligious version of the scala naturae with man at the top his system had eleven grades of animal from highest potential to lowest expressed in their form at birth the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures the lowest laid cold dry minerallike eggs animals came above plants and these in turn were above minerals he grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter animals with blood and below them the colder invertebrates as animals without blood those with blood were divided into the livebearing mammals and the egglaying birds reptiles fish those without blood were insects crustacea nonshelled  cephalopods and shelled and the hardshelled molluscs bivalves and gastropods he recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale and noted various exceptions such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods to a modern biologist the explanation not available to aristotle is convergent evolution philosophers of science have generally concluded that aristotle was not interested in taxonomy but zoologists who studied this question in the early 21st century think otherwise he believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design psychology soul aristotles psychology given in his treatise on the soul peri psychēs posits three kinds of soul psyches the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul humans have all three the vegetative soul is concerned with growth and nourishment the sensitive soul experiences sensations and movement the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the nous intellect and logos reason for aristotle the soul is the form of a living being because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings eg the ability to initiate movement or in the case of plants growth and transformations which aristotle considers types of movement in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians he placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain notable is aristotles division of sensation and thought which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon in on the soul aristotle famously criticizes platos theory of the soul and develops his own in response the first criticism is against platos view of the soul in the timaeus that the soul takes up space and is able to come into physical contact with bodies 20thcentury scholarship overwhelmingly opposed aristotles interpretation of plato and maintained that he had misunderstood him todays scholars have tended to reassess aristotles interpretation and been more positive about it aristotles other criticism is that platos view of reincarnation entails that it is possible for a soul and its body to be mismatched in principle aristotle alleges any soul can go with any body according to platos theory aristotles claim that the soul is the form of a living being eliminates that possibility and thus rules out reincarnation memory according to aristotle in on the soul memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past in other words a memory is a mental picture phantasm that can be recovered aristotle believed an impression is left on a semifluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory a memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation aristotelian common sense and thinking aristotle uses the term memory for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents memory is of the past prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly a transitional channel is needed and located in past experiences both for previous experience and present experience because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences to search for these impressions people search the memory itself within the memory if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another if the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the next when people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed recollection is thus the selfdirected activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity such as numbers and words animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain impressions was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity contrast and contiguity described in his laws of association aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience according to aristotle association is the power innate in a mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled dreams aristotle describes sleep in on sleep and wakefulness sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion so it is vital to the body while a person is asleep the critical activities which include thinking sensing recalling and remembering do not function as they do during wakefulness since a person cannot sense during sleep they cannot have desire which is the result of sensation however the senses are able to work during sleep albeit differently unless they are weary dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus in dreams sensation is still involved but in an altered manner aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water and then looks away the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion when a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention it leaves an impression when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored however during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences so dreams result from these lasting impressions since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience during sleep a person is in an altered state of mind aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus for example a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams like the infatuated person this leads the person to believe the dream is real even when the dreams are absurd in nature in de anima iii 3 aristotle ascribes the ability to create to store and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination phantasia one component of aristotles theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it if a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred secondly any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream for example if while a person is sleeping a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut this sensory experience is not part of the dream lastly the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences practical philosophy aristotles practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics politics economics and rhetoric ethics aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study ie one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake he wrote several treatises on ethics most notably including the nicomachean ethics aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ergon of a thing an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē soul in accordance with reason logos aristotle identified such an optimum activity the virtuous mean between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes wellbeing to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character ēthikē aretē often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom phronesis and their intellect nous can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words a philosopher politics in addition to his works on ethics which address the individual aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics aristotle considered the city to be a natural community moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part he famously stated that man is by nature a political animal and argued that humanitys defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others aristotles conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotles understanding although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to aristotle was the city polis which functions as a political community or partnership koinōnia the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together this is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences in protrepticus the character aristotle states as platos disciple aristotle was rather critical concerning democracy and following the outline of certain ideas from platos statesman he developed a coherent theory of integrating various forms of power into a socalled mixed state economics aristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought especially to thought in the middle ages in politics aristotle addresses the city property and trade his response to criticisms of private property in lionel robbinss view anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society and that although private property is often blamed for social strife such evils in fact come from human nature in politics aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money money came into use because people became dependent on one another importing what they needed and exporting the surplus for the sake of convenience people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable such as iron or silver aristotles discussions on retail and interest was a major influence on economic thought in the middle ages he had a low opinion of retail believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household retail trade seeks to make a profit it thus uses goods as a means to an end rather than as an end unto itself he believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural similarly aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural as it makes a gain out of the money itself and not from its use aristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time he wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them commensurable he goes on to state that money is also useful for future exchange making it a sort of security that is if we do not want a thing now we shall be able to get it when we do want it rhetoric aristotles rhetoric proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience ethos an appeal to the speakers character pathos an appeal to the audiences emotion and logos an appeal to logical reasoning he also categorizes rhetoric into three genres epideictic ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame forensic judicial speeches over guilt or innocence and deliberative speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs enthymeme proof by syllogism and paradeigma proof by example poetics aristotle writes in his poetics that epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry painting sculpture music and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis imitation each varying in imitation by medium object and manner he applies the term mimesis both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artists intention and contends that the audiences realisation of the mimesis is vital to understanding the work itself aristotle states that mimesis is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry follows the pattern of nature because of this aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what stephen halliwell calls highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language the forms also differ in their object of imitation comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation  through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama while it is believed that aristotles poetics originally comprised two books  one on comedy and one on tragedy  only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plotstructure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions aristotle concludes poetics with a discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop transmission more than 2300 years after his death aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields according to the philosopher bryan magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did among countless other achievements aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method taneli kukkonen observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched and his reach in influencing every branch of intellectual enterprise including western ethical and political theory theology rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long as a result kukkonen argues any analysis of reality today will almost certainly carry aristotelian overtones  evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind jonathan barnes wrote that an account of aristotles intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of european thought aristotle has been called the father of logic biology political science zoology embryology natural law scientific method rhetoric psychology realism criticism individualism teleology and meteorology the scholar taneli kukkonen notes that in the best 20thcentury scholarship aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the greek philosophical tradition what follows is an overview of the transmission and influence of his texts and ideas into the modern era his successor theophrastus aristotles pupil and successor theophrastus wrote the history of plants a pioneering work in botany some of his technical terms remain in use such as carpel from carpos fruit and pericarp from pericarpion seed chamber theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than aristotle was instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned later greek philosophy the immediate influence of aristotles work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school aristotles students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion mnason of phocis nicomachus and theophrastus aristotles influence over alexander the great is seen in the latters bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists botanists and researchers he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotles geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all mens common property hellenistic science after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work though interest in aristotles ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilus of chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not though a few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology and after the rise of christianity natural theology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries ernst mayr states that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance revival in the slumbering centuries following the decline of the roman empire aristotles vast philosophical and scientific corpus lay largely dormant in the west but in the burgeoning intellectual heartland of the abbasid caliphate his works underwent a remarkable revival translated into arabic alongside other greek classics aristotles logic ethics and natural philosophy ignited the minds of early islamic scholars through meticulous commentaries and critical engagements figures like alfarabi and ibn sina avicenna breathed new life into aristotles ideas they harmonized his logic with islamic theology employed his scientific methodologies to explore the natural world and even reinterpreted his ethics within the framework of islamic morality this revival was not mere imitation islamic thinkers embraced aristotles rigorous methods while simultaneously challenging his conclusions where they diverged from their own religious beliefs byzantine scholars greek christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were philoponus elias and david in the sixth century and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century john philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotles views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of aristotelian thought philoponus questioned aristotles teaching of physics noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations after a hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by anna comnena medieval islamic world aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology most of the still extant works of aristotle as well as a number of the original greek commentaries were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers scientists and scholars averroes avicenna and alpharabius who wrote on aristotle in great depth also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers alkindus greatly admired aristotles philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the first teacher the title was later used by western philosophers as in the famous poem of dante who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy medieval europe with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west aristotle was practically unknown there from ce 600 to 1100 except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke after the scholastic thomas aquinas wrote his summa theologica working from moerbekes translations and calling aristotle the philosopher the demand for aristotles writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages scholars such as boethius peter abelard and john buridan worked on aristotelian logic according to scholar roger theodore lafferty dante built up the philosophy of the comedy with the works of aristotle as a foundation just as the scholastics used aristotle as the basis for their thinking dante knew aristotle directly from latin translations of his works and indirectly through quotations in the works of albert magnus dante even acknowledges aristotles influence explicitly in the poem specifically when virgil justifies the infernos structure by citing the nicomachean ethics dante famously refers to him as he  who is acknowledged master of those who know medieval judaism moses maimonides considered to be the foremost intellectual figure of medieval judaism adopted aristotelianism from the islamic scholars and based his guide for the perplexed on it and that became the basis of jewish scholastic philosophy maimonides also considered aristotle to be the greatest philosopher that ever lived and styled him as the chief of the philosophers also in his letter to samuel ibn tibbon maimonides observes that there is no need for samuel to study the writings of philosophers who preceded aristotle because the works of the latter are sufficient by themselves and superior to all that were written before them his intellect aristotles is the extreme limit of human intellect apart from him upon whom the divine emanation has flowed forth to such an extent that they reach the level of prophecy there being no level higher early modern science in the early modern period scientists such as william harvey in england and galileo galilei in italy reacted against the theories of aristotle and other classical era thinkers like galen establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the bodys heat as aristotle thought galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace aristotles physics proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight 18th and 19thcentury science the english mathematician george boole fully accepted aristotles logic but decided to go under over and beyond it with his system of algebraic logic in his 1854 book the laws of thought this gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations enables it to solve equations as well as check validity and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms not just two charles darwin regarded aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology in an 1882 letter he wrote that linnaeus and cuvier have been my two gods though in very different ways but they were mere schoolboys to old aristotle also in later editions of the book on the origin of species darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as aristotle the text he cites is a summary by aristotle of the ideas of the earlier greek philosopher empedocles present science the philosopher bertrand russell claims that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine russell calls aristotles ethics repulsive and labelled his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy russell states that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembers what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors the dutch historian of science eduard jan dijksterhuis writes that aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by proceeding so readily to frame a theory of such a general character on limited evidence from their senses in 1985 the biologist peter medawar could still state in pure seventeenth century tones that aristotle had assembled a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay imperfect observation wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility zoologists have frequently mocked aristotle for errors and unverified secondhand reports however modern observation has confirmed several of his more surprising claims aristotles work remains largely unknown to modern scientists though zoologists sometimes mention him as the father of biology or in particular of marine biology practising zoologists are unlikely to adhere to aristotles chain of being but its influence is still perceptible in the use of the terms lower and upper to designate taxa such as groups of plants the evolutionary biologist armand marie leroi has reconstructed aristotles biology while niko tinbergens four questions based on aristotles four causes are used to analyse animal behaviour they examine function phylogeny mechanism and ontogeny the concept of homology began with aristotle the evolutionary developmental biologist lewis i held commented that he would be interested in the concept of deep homology surviving works corpus aristotelicum the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum these texts as opposed to aristotles lost works are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotles school reference to them is made according to the organization of immanuel bekkers royal prussian academy edition aristotelis opera edidit academia regia borussica berlin 18311870 which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works loss and preservation aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls the common writing medium of that era his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric intended for the public and the esoteric for use within the lyceum school aristotles lost works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving aristotelian corpus whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication ciceros description of aristotles literary style as a river of gold must have applied to the published works not the surviving notes a major question in the history of aristotles works is how the exoteric writings were all lost and how the ones now possessed came to be found the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotles school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today according to strabo and plutarch after aristotles death his library and writings went to theophrastus aristotles successor as head of the lycaeum and the peripatetic school after the death of theophrastus the peripatetic library went to neleus of scepsis5 some time later the kingdom of pergamon began conscripting books for a royal library and the heirs of neleus hid their collection in a cellar to prevent it from being seized for that purpose the library was stored there for about a century and a half in conditions that were not ideal for document preservation on the death of attalus iii which also ended the royal library ambitions the existence of aristotelian library was disclosed and it was purchased by apellicon and returned to athens in about 100 bc apellicon sought to recover the texts many of which were seriously degraded at this point due to the conditions in which they were stored he had them copied out into new manuscripts and used his best guesswork to fill in the gaps where the originals were unreadable when sulla seized athens in 86 bc he seized the library and transferred it to rome there andronicus of rhodes organized the texts into the first complete edition of aristotles works and works attributed to him the aristotelian texts we have to day are based on these depictions in art paintings aristotle has been depicted by major artists including lucas cranach the elder justus van gent raphael paolo veronese jusepe de ribera rembrandt and francesco hayez over the centuries among the bestknown depictions is raphaels fresco the school of athens in the vaticans apostolic palace where the figures of plato and aristotle are central to the image at the architectural vanishing point reflecting their importance rembrandts aristotle with a bust of homer too is a celebrated work showing the knowing philosopher and the blind homer from an earlier age as the art critic jonathan jones writes this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world ensnaring us in its musty glowing pitchblack terrible knowledge of time sculptures eponyms the aristotle mountains in antarctica are named after aristotle he was the first person known to conjecture in his book meteorology the existence of a landmass in the southern highlatitude region which he called antarctica aristoteles is a crater

selection external links an american in paris categories 1928 compositions compositions by george gershwin grammy hall of fame award recipients music about paris music commissioned by the new york philharmonic symphonic poems an american in paris is a jazzinfluenced symphonic poem or tone poem for orchestra by american composer george gershwin first performed in 1928 it was inspired by the time that gershwin had spent in paris and evokes the sights and energy of the french capital during the années folles gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta saxophones and automobile horns he brought back four parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition which took place on december 13 1928 in carnegie hall with walter damrosch conducting the new york philharmonic it was damrosch who had commissioned gershwin to write his concerto in f following the earlier success of rhapsody in blue 1924 he completed the orchestration on november 18 less than four weeks before the works premiere he collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer deems taylor background although the story is likely apocryphal gershwin is said to have been attracted by maurice ravels unusual chords and gershwin went on his first trip to paris in 1926 ready to study with ravel after his initial student audition with ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories ravel said he could not teach him saying why be a secondrate ravel when you can be a firstrate gershwin gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for a tour to this end upon his return to new york gershwin joined the efforts of ravels friend robert schmitz a pianist ravel had met during the war to urge ravel to tour the us schmitz was the head of pro musica promoting francoamerican musical relations and was able to offer ravel a 10000 fee for the tour an enticement gershwin knew would be important to raveldecember 2018 gershwin greeted ravel in new york in march 1928 during a party held for ravels birthday by éva gauthier ravels tour reignited gershwins desire to return to paris which he and his brother ira did after meeting ravel ravels high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to nadia boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris yet after he played for her she told him she could not teach him boulanger gave gershwin basically the same advice she gave all her accomplished master students what could i give you that you havent already got this did not set gershwin back as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his rhapsody in blue paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them ezra pound w b yeats ernest hemingway f scott fitzgerald and artist pablo picasso composition gershwin based an american in paris on a melodic fragment called very parisienne written in 1926 on his first visit to paris as a gift to his hosts robert and mabel schirmer gershwin called it a rhapsodic ballet it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works gershwin explained in musical america my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city listens to the various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere the piece is structured into five sections which culminate in a loose aba format gershwins first a episode introduces the two main walking themes in the allegretto grazioso and develops a third theme in the subito con brio the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six this a section featured duple meter singsong rhythms and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe english horn and taxi horns the b sections andante ma con ritmo deciso introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness the allegro that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelvebar blues in the b section gershwin uses common time syncopated rhythms and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet saxophone and snare drum moderato con grazia is the last a section that returns to the themes set in a after recapitulating the walking themes gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final grandioso response gershwin did not particularly like walter damroschs interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris he stated that damroschs sluggish dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work the audience according to edward cushing responded with a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music good and bad ordinarily arouses critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than gershwins concerto in fjuly 2021 some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers césar franck richard wagner or guillaume lekeu on its premierejuly 2021 gershwin responded to the critics instrumentation an american in paris was originally scored for 3 flutes 3rd doubling on piccolo 2 oboes english horn 2 clarinets in bflat bass clarinet in bflat 2 bassoons 4 horns in f 3 trumpets in bflat 3 trombones tuba timpani snare drum bass drum triangle wood block ratchet cymbals low and high tomtoms xylophone glockenspiel celesta 4 taxi horns labeled as a b c and d with circles around them alto saxophone tenor saxophone baritone saxophone all doubling soprano and alto saxophones and strings although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes a b c and d it had been gershwins intention to use the notes aflat4 bflat4 d5 and a3 it is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as a b c and d with circles he was referring to the four horns and not the notes that they played a major revision of the work by composer and arranger f campbellwatson simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only three instruments alto tenor and baritone the soprano and alto saxophone doublings were eliminated to avoid changing instruments this became the standard performing edition until 2000 when gershwin specialist jack gibbons made his own restoration of the original orchestration of an american in paris working directly from gershwins original manuscript including the restoration of gershwins soprano saxophone parts removed in campbellwatsons revision gibbons restored orchestration of an american in paris was performed at londons queen elizabeth hall on july 9 2000 by the city of oxford orchestra conducted by levon parikian william daly arranged the score for piano solo this was published by new world music in 1929 preservation status on september 22 2013 it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score would be eventually released the gershwin family working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan were working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwins true intent it was unknown whether the critical score would include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section or if the score would document changes in the orchestration during gershwins composition process the score to an american in paris was scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released the entire project was expected to take 30 to 40 years to complete but an american in paris was planned to be an early volume in the series two urtext editions of the work were published by the german publisher bnote music in 2015 the changes made by campbellwatson were withdrawn in both editions in the extended urtext 120 bars of music were reintegrated conductor walter damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance on september 9 2017 the cincinnati symphony orchestra gave the world premiere of the longawaited critical edition of the piece prepared by mark clague director of the gershwin initiative

machine company in 1929 with nathaniel shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra gershwin was on hand to supervise the recording however shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studiojuly 2021 then a little later shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the solo gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recordingjuly 2021 this recording is believed to use

to the media three months earlier for the second ceremony in 1930 and the rest of the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at 1100 pm on the night of the awards in 1940 the los angeles times announced the winners before the ceremony began as a result the following year the academy started using a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners the term oscar is a registered trademark of the ampas however in the italian language it is used generically to refer to any award or award ceremony regardless of which field milestones the first best actor awarded was emil jannings for his performances in the last command and the way of all flesh he had to return to europe before the ceremony so the academy agreed to give him the prize earlier this made him the first academy award winner in history at that time winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period for example jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and janet gaynor later won a single oscar for performances in three films with the fourth ceremony however the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film for the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years at the 29th ceremony held in 1957 the best foreign

in 1974 bemused host david niven quipped isnt it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings later evidence arose suggesting that opels appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the shows producer jack haley jr robert metzler the shows business manager believed that the incident had been planned in some way during the dress rehearsal niven had asked metzlers wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line which was thus not the adlib it appeared to be the 74th academy awards held in

abandoned in favor of britannia metal a pewterlike alloy which is then plated in copper nickel silver and finally 24karat gold due to a metal shortage during world war ii oscars were made of painted plaster for three years following the war the academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for goldplated metal ones the only addition to the oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base the original oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the cw shumway  sons foundry in batavia illinois which also contributed to casting the molds for the vince lombardi trophy and emmy award statuettes from 1983 to 2015 approximately 50 oscars in a tin alloy with gold plating were made each year in chicago by illinois manufacturer rs owens  company it would take between three and

owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the academy and service existing oscars that need replating naming the origin of the nickname of the trophy has been disputed as multiple people have taken credit for naming the trophy oscar margaret herrick librarian and president of the academy may have said she named it after her supposed uncle oscar in 1921 the only corroboration was a 1938 clipping from the los angeles examiner in which herrick told a story of her and her husband joking with each other using the phrase hows your uncle oscar bette davis in her 1962 autobiography claimed she named it in 1936 after her first husband harmon oscar nelson of whom the statues rear end reminded her but the term had been in use at least two years before and in a 1974 biography written by whitney stine with commentary from davis davis wrote i relinquish once and for all any claim that i was the one  so academy of motion picture arts and sciences the honor is all yours columnist sidney skolsky wrote in his 1970 memoir that he came up with the term in 1934 under pressure for a deadline mocking vaudeville comedians who asked will you have a cigar oscar the academy credits skolsky with the first confirmed newspaper reference to oscar in his column on march 16 1934 which was written about that years 6th academy awards but in the newspaper clipping that skolsky referred to he wrote that these statues are called oscars meaning that the name was already in use bruce davis a former executive director of the academy credited eleanore lilleberg a secretary at the academy when the award was first introduced for the nickname she had overseen the preceremony handling of the awards davis credits lilleberg because he found in an autobiography of einar lilleberg eleanores brother that einar had referenced a norwegian army veteran named oscar that the two knew in chicago whom einar described as having always stood straight and tall he asserts credit should almost certainly belong to lilleberg in 2021 brazilian researcher dr waldemar dalenogare neto found the probable first public mention of the name oscar in journalist relman morins cinematters column in the los angeles evening postrecord on december 5 1933 since the awards didnt take place that year he said whats happened to the annual academy banquet as a rule the banquet and the awarding of oscar the bronze statuette given for best performances is all over long before this this information changes the version of sidney skolsky as the first to publicly mention the name engraving to prevent information identifying the oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates until 2010 winners returned their statuettes to the academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective oscars since 2010 winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscriptionprocessing station at the governors ball a party held immediately after the oscar ceremony the rs owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony bearing the name of every potential winner the nameplates for the nonwinning nominees are later recycled ownership of oscar statuettes prior to 1950 oscar statuettes were and remain the property of the recipient since then the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that the statuette be first offered for sale back to the academy for us1 if a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation then the academy keeps the statuette academy awards predating this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for sixfigure sums in 1989 michael todds grandson tried to sell todds best picture oscar for his 1956 production of around the world in 80 days to a movie prop collector the academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining a permanent injunction against the sale in 1992 harold russell consigned his 1946 oscar for best supporting actor for the best years of our lives to auction to raise money for his wifes medical expenses though his decision caused controversy the first oscar ever to be sold passed to a private collector on august 6 1992 for 60500 us today russell defended his action saying i dont know why anybody would be critical my wifes health is much more important than sentimental reasons the movie will be here even if oscar isnt in december 2011 orson welles 1941 oscar for citizen kane academy award for best original screenplay was put up for auction after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the academy on december 20 2011 it sold in an online auction for us861542 us today some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the academy which keeps them in its treasury other awards presented by the academy in addition to the academy award of

feature and awards in short film categories additionally the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run with at least one of the daily showings starting between 6 pm and 10 pm local time for example the 2009 best picture winner the hurt locker was originally first released in 2008 but did not qualify for the 2008 awards as it did not play its oscarqualifying run in los angeles until mid2009 thus qualifying for the 2009 awards foreign films must include english subtitles and each country can submit only one film for consideration in the international feature film category per year rule 2 states that a film must be featurelength defined as a minimum of 40 minutes except for shortsubject awards and it must exist either on a 35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24 frames or 48 frames progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of 2048 by 1080 pixels since the 90th academy awards presented in 2018 multipart and limited series have been ineligible for the best documentary feature award this followed the win of oj made in america an eighthour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on abc and espn in that category in 2017 the academys announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film the best international feature film award does not require a us release it requires the film to be submitted as its countrys official selection the best documentary feature award requires either weeklong releases in both los angeles county and any of the five boroughs of new york city during the previous calendar year or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the documentary feature qualifying festival list regardless of any public exhibition or

short film and best live action short film have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards first the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year instead covering one year starting on october 1 and ending on september 30 of the calendar year before the ceremony second there are multiple methods of qualification the main method is a weeklong theatrical release in either new york city or los angeles county during the eligibility period films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film festivals designated by the academy also without regard to prior public distribution finally a film that is selected as a gold silver or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous student academy awards is also eligible documentary category for that award and animation narrative alternative or international for the other awards the requirements for the qualifying

directors writers for writers actors for actors etc in the special case of best picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees in all major categories a variant of the single transferable vote is used with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees ten for best picture ranked preferentially in certain categories including international feature film documentary and animated feature nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches in most categories the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members since 2009 the best picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting since 2013 reweighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the best visual effects film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for best picture in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders for example a producer of the 2009 best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the frontrunner the hurt locker eventually won academy screening room the academy screening room or academy digital screening room is a secure streaming platform which allows voting members of the academy to view all eligible films except initially those in the international category in one place it was introduced in 2019 for the 2020 oscars though dvd screeners and academy inperson screenings were still provided for films to be included on the platform the north american distributor must pay 12500 including a watermarking fee and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the academy the platform can be accessed via apple tv and roku players the watermarking process involved several video security firms creating a forensic watermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings in 2021 for the 2022 oscars the academy banned all physical screeners and inperson screenings restricting official membership viewing to the academy screening room films eligible in the documentary and international categories were made available in different sections of the platform distributors can also pay an extra fee to add video featurettes to promote their films on the platform the inperson screenings were said to be cancelled because of the covid19 pandemic eligible films do not have to be added to the platform but the academy advertises them to voting members when they are awards ceremonies telecast the major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees it is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during november or december of the previous year this is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day black tie dress is the most common outfit for men although fashion may dictate not wearing a bowtie and musical performers are sometimes not required to adhere to this the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast the academy awards is the worlds longestrunning awards show televised live from the us to all time zones in north america and worldwide and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world the oscars were first televised in 1953 by nbc which continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when abc took over televising the festivities including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966 through 1970 nbc regained the rights for five years 197175 then abc resumed broadcast duties in 1976 and its current contract with the academy runs through 2028 the academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets especially those outside of the americas in more desirable local timeslots the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970 but only two south american countries chile and brazil purchased the rights to air the broadcast by that time the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in 50 countries a decade later the rights were already being sold to 60 countries and by 1984 the tv rights to the awards were licensed in 76 countries the ceremonies were moved up from late marchearly april to late february since 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success coinciding with the ncaa division i mens basketball tournament which would cut into the academy awards audience in 1976 and 1977 abcs regained oscars were moved from tuesday to monday and went directly opposite the national championship game on nbc the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period some years the ceremony is moved into the first sunday of march to avoid a clash with the winter olympic games another reason for the move to late february and early march is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of passover and easter which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast as of 2020 the production of the academy awards telecast held the distinction of winning one the highest number of emmys in history with 54 wins and 280 nominations overall after many years of being held on mondays at 600 pm pacific900 pm eastern since the 1999 ceremonies it was moved to sundays at 530 pm pt830 pm et the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays that los angeles rushhour traffic jams could be avoided and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier for many years the film industry opposed a sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office in 2010 the academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into january citing tv viewers fatigue with the film industrys long awards season however such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail furthermore a january ceremony on sunday would clash with national football league playoff games in 2018 the academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late february to midfebruary beginning with the 92nd academy awards in 2020 in 2024 the ceremony was moved to an even earlier start time of 400 pm pt700 pm et the apparent impetus being the ability for abc to air a halfhour of primetime programming as a leadout program at 730 pm pt1030 pm et originally scheduled for april 8 1968 the 40th academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days because of the assassination of dr martin luther king jr on march 30 1981 the 53rd academy awards was postponed for one day after the attempted assassination of president ronald reagan and others in washington dc in 1993 an in memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months a selection compiled by a small committee of academy members this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect with the segment having a popularity contest feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subjects cultural impact the applause has since been muted during the telecast and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead this segment was later followed by a commercial break in terms of broadcast length the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours the first oscars in 1929 lasted 15 minutes at the other end of the spectrum the 2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twentythree minutes in 2010 the organizers of the academy awards announced winners acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds this according to organizer bill mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show  overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion in 2016 in a further effort to streamline speeches winners dedications were displayed on an onscreen ticker during the 2018 ceremony host jimmy kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become by announcing that he would give a brandnew jet ski to whoever gave the shortest speech of the night a reward won by mark bridges when accepting his best costume design award for phantom thread the wall street journal analyzed the average minutes spent across the 20142018 telecasts as follows 14 on song performances 25 on the hosts speeches 38 on prerecorded clips and 78 on the awards themselves broken into 24 on the introduction and announcement 24 on winners walking to the stage and 30 on their acceptance speeches although still dominant in ratings the viewership of the academy awards has steadily dropped the 88th academy awards were the lowestrated in the past eight years although with increases in male and 1849 viewership while the show itself also faced mixed reception following the show variety reported that abc was in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the oscars seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself currently and nominally ampas is responsible for most aspects of the telecast including the choice of production staff and hosting although abc is allowed to have some input on their decisions in august 2016 ampas extended its contract with abc through 2028 the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives abc any further creative control over the telecast tv ratings historically the telecasts viewership is higher when boxoffice hits are favored to win the best picture award more than 5725 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th academy awards in 1998 the year of titanic which generated a box office haul during its initial 199798 run of us6008 million in the us a boxoffice record that would remain unsurpassed for years the 76th academy awards ceremony in which the lord of the rings the return of the king pretelecast box office earnings of us368 million received 11 awards including best picture drew 4356 million viewers the mostwatched ceremony based on nielsen ratings to date however was the 42nd academy awards best picture midnight cowboy which drew a 434 household rating on april 7 1970 hoping to reinvigorate the preshow and ratings the 2023 oscars organizers hired members of the met gala creative team by contrast ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings despite how much critical acclaim those films have received the 78th academy awards which awarded a lowbudget independent film crash with a preoscar gross of us534 million generated an audience of 3864 million with a household rating of 2291 in 2008 the 80th academy awards telecast was watched by 3176 million viewers on average with an 1866 household rating the lowestrated and leastwatched ceremony at the time in spite of celebrating 80 years of the academy awards the best picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film this time the coen brotherss no country for old men whereas the 92nd academy awards drew an average of 236 million viewers the 93rd academy awards drew an even lower viewership of 104 million the lowest viewership recorded by nielsen since it started recording audience totals in 1974 the 94th and 95th editions drew 166 and 187 million viewers respectively still below the audience of the 92nd edition archive the academy film archive holds copies of every academy awards ceremony since the 1949 oscars as well as material on many prior ceremonies along with ancillary material related to more recent shows copies are held in a variety of film video and digital formats broadcasters venues in 1929 the first academy awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the hollywood roosevelt hotel from 1930 to 1943 the ceremony alternated between two venues the ambassador hotel on wilshire boulevard and the biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles graumans chinese theatre in hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946 followed by the shrine auditorium in los angeles from 1947 to 1948 the 21st academy awards in 1949 were held at the academy award theatre at what had been the academys headquarters on melrose avenue in hollywood from 1950 to 1960 the awards were presented at hollywoods pantages theatre with the advent of television the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in hollywood and new york first at the nbc international theatre 1953 and then at the nbc century theatre after which the ceremony took place solely in los angeles the oscars moved to the santa monica civic auditorium in santa monica california in 1961 by 1969 the academy decided to move the ceremonies back to downtown los angeles this time to the dorothy chandler pavilion at the los angeles county music center in the late 1990s and early 2000s the ceremony returned to the shrine auditorium in 2002 hollywoods dolby theatre previously known as the kodak theatre became the presentations current venue awards of merit categories current categories in the first year of the awards the best directing award was split into two categories drama and comedy at times the best original score award has also been split into separate categories drama and comedymusical from the 1930s through the 1960s the art direction now production design cinematography and costume design awards were likewise split into two categories blackandwhite films and color films prior to 2012 the production design award was called art direction while the makeup and hairstyling award was called makeup in august 2018 the academy announced that several categories would not be televised live but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony following dissent from academy members they announced that they would indeed air all 24 categories live this followed several proposals among them the introduction of a popular film category that the academy had announced but did not implement discontinued categories proposed categories the board of governors meets each year and considers new award categories to date the following categories have been proposed special categories the special academy awards are voted on by special committees rather than by the academy membership as a whole they are not always presented on an annual basis current special categories discontinued special categories criticism and controversies accusations of commercialism due to the positive exposure and prestige of the academy awards many studios spend around 25 million dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the oscar season this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing and lobbying than by quality william friedkin an academy awardwinning film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in 2009 describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself tim dirks editor of amcs filmsite has written of the academy awards unfortunately the critical worth artistic vision cultural influence and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight especially since the 1980s moneymaking formulamade blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowdpleasing titans and best picture winners but they havent necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measurea recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the oscar season is the whisper campaign these campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those that were involved in creating the movie examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against zero dark thirty suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that lincoln distorts history accusations of bias typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an overrepresentation of romantic historical epics biographical dramas romantic dramedies and family melodramas most of which are released in the us in the last three months of the calendar year the oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded the term oscar bait was coined to describe such movies this has led at times to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience eg by favoring oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues despite the success of the dark knight the film did not receive a best picture nomination at the 81st academy awards this decision received substantial criticism and was described as a snub by many publications the backlash to the decision was such that for the 82nd academy awards awards in 2010 the academy increased the limit for best picture nominees from five to ten a change known as the dark knight rule allegations of a lack of diversity the academy awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees this criticism is based on the statistics from every academy awards since 1929 which show that only 64 of academy award nominees have been nonwhite and since 1991 112 of nominees have been nonwhite with the rate of winners being even more polarizing due to a variety of reasons including marketability and historical bans on interracial couples a number of highprofile oscars have been given to yellowface portrayals as well as performances of asian characters rewritten for white characters it took until 2023 for an asian woman to win an academy award for best actress when michelle yeoh received the award for her performance in everything everywhere all at once the 88th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott popularized on social media with the hashtag oscarssowhite based on activists perception that its allwhite acting nominee list reflected bias in response the academy initiated historic changes in membership by 2020 some media critics claim the academys efforts to address its purported racial gender and national biases are merely distractions by contrast the golden globe awards already have multiple winners of asian descent in leading actress categories some question whether the academys definition of merit is just or empowering for nonamericans the academys representation and inclusion standards have been criticized for excluding jews as a distinct underrepresented class miscategorization of actors the academy has no rules for how to categorize whether a performance is leading or supporting and it is up to the discretion of the studios whether a given performance is submitted for either best actoractress or best supporting actoractress this has led situations where a film has two or more coleads and one of these is submitted in a supporting category to avoid the two leads competing against each other and to increase the films chances of winning this practice has been derisively called category fraud for example rooney mara was nominated for best supporting actress for carol 2015 despite her having a comparable amount of screentime to cate blanchett who was nominated for best actress another example is once upon a time in hollywood 2019 where brad pitt was nominated for and won best supporting actor even though he played an equally important role to best actor nominee leonardo dicaprio in both these cases critics argued that the weinstein company the studio behind the former film had placed someone who was actually a leading actor or actress into the supporting categories to avoid them competing against their colead symbolism or sentimentalization acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity to make up for a snub for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded or presented as a career honor to recognize a distinguished nominees entire body of work recognition of streaming media film following the 91st academy awards in february 2019 in which the netflixbroadcast film roma had been nominated for ten awards including the best picture category steven spielberg and other members of the academy discussed changing the requirements through the board of governors for films as to exclude those from netflix and other media streaming services spielberg had been concerned that netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical oscarwinning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than other best picturenominated films while still being able to meet the minimal theatricalrun status to qualify for an oscar the united states department of justice having heard of this potential rule change wrote a letter to the academy in march 2019 cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise antitrust concerns against the academy following its april 2019 board meeting the academy board of governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs 2022 chris rock and will smith slapping incident during the 94th academy awards on march 27 2022 chris rock joked about jada pinkett smiths shaved head with a gi jane reference will smith walked onstage and slapped rock across the face then returned to his seat and told rock twice to keep my wifes name out of your fucking mouth while later accepting the best actor award for king richard smith apologized to the academy and the other nominees but not to rock rock decided not to press charges against smithmarch 2022 on april 8 2022 the academy made an announcement via a letter sent by president david rubin and ceo dawn hudson informing the public that will smith had received a tenyear ban from attending the oscars as a result of the incident refusals of the award some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars the first to do so was screenwriter dudley nichols best writing in 1935 for the informer nichols boycotted the 8th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers guild nichols eventually accepted the 1935 award three years later at the 1938 ceremony nichols was nominated for three further academy awards during his career george c scott became the second person to refuse his award best actor in 1970 for patton at the 43rd academy awards ceremony scott described it as a meat parade saying i dont want any part of it the third person to refuse the award was marlon brando who refused his award best actor for 1972s the godfather citing the film industrys discrimination and mistreatment of native americans at the 45th academy awards ceremony brando asked actress and civil rights activist sacheen littlefeather to read a 15page speech in his place detailing his criticisms for which there was booing and cheering by the audience in 2022 littlefeather was accused by her sisters of misrepresenting her ancestry as native american disqualifications seven films have had nominations revoked before the official award ceremony one film was disqualified after winning the award and had the winner return the oscar one film had its nomination revoked after the award ceremony when it had not won the oscar remarks about animated films as childrens genre at the 94th academy awards in 2022 the award for the best animated feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed as disney princess characters in liveaction remakes of their respective animated films lily james cinderella naomi scott aladdin and halle bailey the little mermaid while introducing the category bailey stated that animated films are formative experiences as kids who watch them as james put it so many kids watch these movies over and over over and over again scott added i see some parents who know exactly what were talking about the remarks were heavily criticized by animation fans and those working in the animation industry as infantilizing the medium and perpetuating the stigma that animated works are strictly for children especially since the industry was credited with sustaining the flow of hollywood content and revenue during the height of the covid19 pandemic phil lord coproducer of one of the nominated films the mitchells vs the machines tweeted that it was super cool to position animation as something that kids watch and adults have to endure the films official social media accounts responded to the joke with an image reading animation is cinema a week later lord and his producing partner christopher miller wrote a guest column in variety criticizing the academy for the joke and how hollywood has been treating animation writing that no one set out to diminish animated films but its high time we set out to elevate them they also suggested to the academy that the category should be presented by a filmmaker who respects the art of animation as cinema adding to the controversy was that the award for best animated short film the nominees for which were mostly made up of shorts not aimed at children was one of the eight categories that were not presented during the live broadcast the winner for the best animated short award was the windshield wiper a multilingual spanishamerican film which is adult animated while another nominee in three categories best animated feature best documentary feature film and best international feature film was flee a pg13 rated animated documentary about an afghan refugee alberto mielgo director of the windshield wiper later gave an acceptance speech for the oscar animation is an art that includes every single art that you can imagine animation for adults is a

international is a highprecision atomic coordinate time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on earths geoid tai is a weighted average of the time kept by over 450 atomic clocks in over 80 national laboratories worldwide it is a continuous scale of time without leap seconds and it is the principal realisation of terrestrial time with a fixed offset of epoch it is the basis for coordinated universal time utc which is used for civil timekeeping all over the earths surface and which has leap seconds utc deviates from tai by a number of whole seconds 2017 when another leap second was put into effect utc is currently exactly 37 seconds behind tai the 37 seconds result from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972 plus 27 leap seconds in utc since 1972 tai may be reported using traditional means of specifying days carried over from nonuniform time standards based on the rotation of the earth specifically both julian days and the gregorian calendar are used tai in this form was synchronised with universal time at the beginning of 1958 and the two have drifted apart ever since due primarily to the slowing rotation of the earth operation tai is a weighted average of the time kept by over 450 atomic clocks in over 80 national laboratories worldwide the majority of the clocks involved are caesium clocks the international system of units si definition of the second is based on caesium the clocks are compared using gps signals and twoway satellite time and frequency transfer due to the signal averaging tai is an order of magnitude more stable than its best constituent clock the participating institutions each broadcast in real time a frequency signal with timecodes which is their estimate of tai time codes are usually published in the form of utc which differs from tai by a wellknown integer number of seconds these time scales are denoted in the form utcnpl in the utc form where npl here identifies the national physical laboratory uk the tai form may be denoted tainpl the latter is not to be confused with tanpl which denotes an independent atomic time scale not synchronised to tai or to anything else the clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other the international bureau of weights and measures bipm france combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible this combined time scale is published monthly in circular t and is the canonical tai this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc  utck equal to tai  taik for each participating institution k the same circular also gives tables of tai  tak for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty circular t or by errata in a subsequent circular t aside from this once published in circular t the tai scale is not revised in hindsight it is possible to discover errors in tai and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale since the published circulars are definitive better estimates do not create another version of tai it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of terrestrial time tt history early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock the atomic clocks were not operated continuously atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955 using the first caesium atomic clock at the national physical laboratory uk npl it was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the royal greenwich observatory and to establish a time scale called greenwich atomic ga the united states naval observatory began the a1 scale on 13 september 1956 using an atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the nbsa scale at the national bureau of standards boulder colorado on 9 october 1957 the international time bureau bih began a time scale tm or am in july 1955 using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of vlf radio signals the bih scale a1 and nbsa were defined by an epoch at the beginning of 1958 the procedures used by the bih evolved and the name for the time scale changed a3 in 1964 and tabih in 1969 the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967 from 1971 to 1975 the general conference on weights and measures and the international committee for weights and measures made a series of decisions that designated the bipm time scale international atomic time tai in the 1970s it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined tai scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks starting from the julian date 24431445 1 january 1977 000000 corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that tai would correspond to proper time at the geoid mean sea level because the clocks were on average well above sea level this meant that tai slowed by about one part in a trillion the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name eal échelle atomique libre meaning free atomic scale the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for barycentric coordinate time tcb geocentric coordinate time tcg and terrestrial time tt which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system all three of these time scales were defined to read jd 24431445003725 1 january 1977 000032184 exactly at that instant tai was henceforth a realisation of tt with the equation tttai  tai  32184 s the continued existence of tai was questioned in a 2007 letter from the bipm to the itur which stated in the case of a redefinition of utc without leap seconds the cctf would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing tai as it would remain parallel to the continuous utc relation to utc contrary to tai utc is a discontinuous time scale it is occasionally adjusted by leap seconds between these adjustments it is composed of segments that are mapped to atomic time by a constant offset from its beginning in 1961 through december 1971 the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that utc approximated ut2 afterward these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate ut1 this was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale the less frequent wholesecond adjustments meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally the fact that it continues to approximate ut1 means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of universal time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of utc see also notes references footnotes bibliography external links altruism categories altruism auguste comte defence mechanisms morality moral psychology philanthropy social philosophy interpersonal relationships virtue altruism is the principle and practice of concern for the wellbeing andor happiness of other humans or animals above oneself while objects of altruistic concern vary it is an important moral value in many cultures and religions it may be considered a synonym of selflessness the opposite of selfishness the word altruism was popularized and possibly coined by the french philosopher auguste comte in french as altruisme for an antonym of egoism he derived it from the italian altrui which in turn was derived from latin alteri meaning other people or somebody else altruism as observed in populations of organisms is when an individual performs an action at a cost to themselves in terms of eg pleasure and quality of life time probability of survival or reproduction that benefits directly or indirectly another individual without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty or concern for the common good the latter are predicated upon social relationships whilst altruism does not consider relationships whether true altruism is possible in human psychology is a subject of debate the theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification the validity of this argument depends on whether such intrinsic rewards qualify as benefits the term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others used in this sense it is usually contrasted with egoism which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first effective altruism is the use of evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to benefit others the notion of altruism the concept of altruism has a history in philosophical and ethical thought the term was coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science auguste comte and has become a major topic for psychologists especially evolutionary psychology researchers evolutionary biologists and ethologists whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism in simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them above oneself scientific viewpoints anthropology marcel mausss essay the gift contains a passage called note on alms this note describes the evolution of the notion of alms and by extension of altruism from the notion of sacrifice in it he writes evolutionary explanations in the science of ethology the study of animal behaviour and more generally in the study of social evolution altruism refers to behavior by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor in evolutionary psychology this term may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners tipping courtship gifts production of public goods and environmentalism theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce ideas compatible with evolutionary origins two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioral strategies some of the proposed mechanisms are such explanations do not imply that humans consciously calculate how to increase their inclusive fitness when doing altruistic acts instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote certain altruistic behaviors the benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to nokin to friends than strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to noncompetitors than competitors and to members ingroups than to members of outgroups the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george r prices development of the price equation a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds such as dictyostelium mucoroides these protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved to facilitate longterm highcost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for leftwing politics for example by the russian zoologist and anarchist peter kropotkin in his 1902 book mutual aid a factor of evolution and moral philosopher peter singer in his book a darwinian left neurobiology jorge moll and jordan grafman neuroscientists at the national institutes of health and labsdor hospital network provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging in their research they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex however when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortexseptal region these structures are related to social attachment and bonding in other species the experiment suggested that altruism is not a higher moral faculty overpowering innate selfish desires but a fundamental ingrained and enjoyable trait in the brain one brain region the subgenual anterior cingulate cortexbasal forebrain contributes to learning altruistic behavior especially in people with trait empathy the same study identified a link between giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding bill harbaugh a university of oregon economist in an fmri scanner test conducted with his psychologist colleague dr ulrich mayr reached the same conclusions as jorge moll and jordan grafman about giving to charity although they were able to divide the study group into two groups egoists and altruists one of their discoveries was that though rarely even some of the considered egoists sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in charity such as a persons environment and values a recent metaanalysis of fmri studies conducted by shawn rhoads jo cutler and abigail marsh analyzed the results of prior studies of generosity in which participants could freely choose to give or not give resources to someone else the results of this study confirmed that altruism is supported by distinct mechanisms from giving motivated by reciprocity or by fairness this study also confirmed that the right ventral striatum is recruited during altruistic giving as well as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral anterior insula which are regions previously implicated in empathy abigail marsh has conducted studies of realworld altruists that have also identified an important role for the amygdala in human altruism in realworld altruists such as people who have donated kidneys to strangers the amygdala is larger than in typical adults altruists amygdalas are also more responsive than those of typical adults to the sight of others distress which is thought to reflect an empathic response to distress this structure may also be involved in altruistic choices due to its role in encoding the value of outcomes for others this is consistent with the findings of research in nonhuman animals which has identified neurons within the amygdala that specifically encode the value of others outcomes activity in which appears to drive altruistic choices in monkeys psychology the international encyclopedia of the social sciences defines psychological altruism as a motivational state to increase anothers welfare psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism which refers to the motivation to increase ones welfare in keeping with this research in realworld altruists including altruistic kidney donors bone marrow donors humanitarian aid workers and heroic rescuers findings that these altruists are primarily distinguished from other adults by unselfish traits and decisionmaking patterns this suggests that human altruism reflects genuinely high valuation of others outcomes there has been some debate on whether humans are capable of psychological altruism some definitions specify a selfsacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors however because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases the selflessness of altruistic acts is difficult to prove the social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when the benefits outweigh the costs to the self daniel batson a psychologist examined this question and argued against the social exchange theory he identified four significant motives to ultimately benefit the self egoism to ultimately benefit the other person altruism to benefit a group collectivism or to uphold a moral principle principlism altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that empathyinduced altruism can be genuinely selfless the empathyaltruism hypothesis states that psychological altruism exists and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone suffering feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with personal distress which compels people to reduce their unpleasant emotions and increase their positive ones by helping someone in need empathy is thus not selfless since altruism works either as a way to avoid those negative unpleasant feelings and have positive pleasant feelings when triggered by others need for help or as a way to gain social reward or avoid social punishment by helping people with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid allowing it unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to anothers suffering helping behavior is seen in humans from about two years old when a toddler can understand subtle emotional cues in psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the persons distress the number of bystanders witnessing pain or suffering affects the likelihood of helping the bystander effect more significant numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility however a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism as a form of altruism on happiness and health and have consistently found that those who exhibit volunteerism also have better current and future health and wellbeing in a study of older adults those who volunteered had higher life satisfaction and will to live and less depression anxiety and somatization volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages one study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over 30 years and found that 52 of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36 of those who did volunteer experienced one a study on adults aged 55 and older found that during the fouryear study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63 lower likelihood of dying after controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44 reduction in mortality merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater wellbeing a study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness happier people are kinder and more grateful kinder people are happier and more grateful and more grateful people are happier and kinder the study suggests while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite directionthat happier people are also kinder the relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional studies found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states feeling overtaxed by the needs of others has negative effects on health and happiness for example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one although positive effects were still significant pathological altruism pathological altruism is altruism taken to an unhealthy extreme such that it either harms the altruistic person or the persons wellintentioned actions cause more harm than good the term pathological altruism was popularised by the book pathological altruism examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of ones own needs hoarding of animals and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid sociology sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society the structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other prosocial altruistic actions for the common good is a commonly researched topic within the field the american sociology association asa acknowledges public sociology saying the intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct good societies is unquestionable this type of sociology seeks contributions that aid popular and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies how altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and build the good society the motivation of altruism is also the focus of study for example one study links the occurrence of moral outrage to altruistic compensation of victims studies show that generosity in laboratory and in online experiments is contagious  people imitate the generosity they observe in others religious viewpoints most if not all of the worlds religions promote altruism as a very important moral value buddhism christianity hinduism islam jainism judaism and sikhism etc place particular emphasis on altruistic morality buddhism altruism figures prominently in buddhism love and compassion are components of all forms of buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion these qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being dalai lama the notion of altruism is modified in such a worldview since the belief is that such a practice promotes the practitioners own happiness the more we care for the happiness of others the greater our own sense of wellbeing becomes dalai lama in the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative unhappy consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment but from the law of karma which functions like a natural law of cause and effect a simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes if one causes suffering then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering if one causes happiness then as a natural consequence one would experience happinessjuly 2023 jainism the fundamental principles of jainism revolve around altruism not only fordoes for mean towards or by in this phrase humans but for all sentient beings jainism preaches sa  to live and let live not harming sentient beings ie uncompromising reverence for all life it also considers all living things to be equalequal in what way on what dimension the first sa rishabhdev introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation giving oneself up for others nonviolence and compassion for all living thingsjuly 2023 the principle of nonviolence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become sa god in jainism because all living beings possess a soul great care and awareness is essential in ones actions jainism emphasizes the equality of all life advocating harmlessness towards all whether the creatures are great or small this policy extends even to microscopic organisms jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householdersjuly 2023 christianity thomas aquinas interprets you should love your neighbour as yourself as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others considering that the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship he quotes aristotle that the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves aquinas concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves we naturally seek the common good the good of the whole more than any private good the good of a part however he thought we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours and more than our bodily lifesince the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude a more desirable thing than bodily wellbeing in coining the word altruism as stated above comte was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine which is present in some theological schools within catholicism the aim and focus of christian life is a life that glorifies god with obeying christs command to treat others equally caring for them and understanding eternity in heaven is what jesus resurrection at calvary was all about many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of god 1 john states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman and that hatred of ones fellowman is the same as hatred of god thomas jay oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love an altruistic action is not always a loving action oord defines altruism as acting for the others good and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for ones own good when the others demands undermine overall wellbeing german philosopher max scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak one way is a sincere expression of christian love motivated by a powerful feeling of security strength and inner salvation of the invincible fullness of ones own life and existence8889 another way is merely one of the many modern substitutes for love nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other peoples business at its worst scheler says love for the small the poor the weak and the oppressed is really disguised hatred repressed envy an impulse to detract etc directed against the opposite phenomena wealth strength power largesse islam in the arabic language ar إيثار means preferring others to oneself on the topic of donating blood to nonmuslims a controversial topic within the faith the shia religious professor fadhil almilani has provided theological evidence that makes it positively justifiable in fact he considers it a form of religious sacrifice and ithar altruism for sufis iythar means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of ones own concerns where concern for others is deemed as a demand made by god on the human body considered to be property of god alone the importance of iythar aka ar lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good islam considers those practicing ar as abiding by the highest degree of nobility this is similar to the notion of chivalry a constant concern for god results in a careful attitude towards people animals and other things in this world judaism judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation rabbi abraham isaac kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity love is defined as bestowal or giving which is the intention of altruism this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god kabbalah defines god as the force of giving in existence rabbi moshe chaim luzzatto focused on the purpose of creation and how the will of god was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this force of giving modern kabbalah developed by rabbi yehuda ashlag in his writings about the future generation focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework120130 ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism love for one another ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity sikhism altruism is essential to the sikh religion the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed anyone can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love affection sacrifice patience harmony and truthfulness sa or selfless service to the community for its own sake is an important concept in sikhism the fifth guru arjun dev sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth the greatest gift to humanity the guru granth the ninth guru tegh bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity in the late seventeenth century guru gobind singh the tenth guru in sikhism was at war with the mughal rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow sikh bhai kanhaiya attended the troops of the enemy he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield what were you doing and why asked the guru i was giving water to the wounded because i saw your face in all of them replied bhai kanhaiya the guru responded then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru under the tutelage of the guru bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism which is still engaged today in doing good to others and in training new recruits for this service hinduism in hinduism selflessness sa love sa kindness sa and forgiveness sa are considered as the highest acts of humanity or sa giving alms to the beggars or poor people is considered as a divine act or sa and hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or sa and will led them to heaven or sa in afterlife altruism is also the central act of various hindu mythology and religious poems and songs mass donation of clothes to poor people sa or blood donation camp or mass food donation sa for poor people is common in various hindu religious ceremoniesjuly 2023 the bhagavad gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga achieving oneness with god through action  nishkam karma or action without expectation  desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in hindu literature and are central to hindu morality philosophy there is a wide range of philosophical views on humans obligations or motivations to act altruistically proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically the opposing view is ethical egoism which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own selfinterest both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their coinhabitants a related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism the thesis that humans always act in their own selfinterest and that true altruism is impossible rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in ones selfinterest without specifying how this affects ones moral obligations effective altruism effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others effective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact based upon their values it is the broad evidencebased and causeneutral approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity effective altruism is part of the larger movement towards evidencebased practices while a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects companies and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives help people or otherwise have the biggest benefit people associated with the movement include philosopher peter singer facebook co founder dustin moskovitz cari tuna oxfordbased researchers william macaskill and toby ord and professional poker player liv boeree extreme altruism extreme altruism also known as costly altruism extraordinary altruism or heroic behaviours shall be distinguished from heroism refers to selfless acts directed to a stranger which significantly exceed the normal altruistic behaviours often involving risks or great cost to the altruists themselves since acts of extreme altruism are often directed towards strangers many commonly accepted models of simple altruism appear inadequate in explaining this phenomenon one of the initial concepts was introduced by wilson in 1976 which he referred to as hardcore altruism this form is characterised by impulsive actions directed towards others typically a stranger and lacking incentives for reward since then several papers have mentioned the possibility of such altruism the current slow progress in the field is due to general ethical guidelines that restrict exposing research participants to costly or risky decisions consequently much research has based their studies on living organ donations and the actions of carnegie hero medal recipients actions which involve high risk high cost and are of infrequent occurrences a typical example of extreme altruism would be nondirected kidney donation  a living person donating one of their kidneys to a stranger without any benefits or knowing the recipient however current research can only be carried out on a small population that meets the requirements of extreme altruism most of the time the research is also via the form of selfreport which could lead to selfreport biases due to the limitations the current gap between high stakes and normal altruism remains unknown characteristics of extreme altruists in 1970 schwartz hypothesised that extreme altruism is positively related to a persons moral norms and is not influenced by the cost associated with the action this hypothesis was supported in the same study examining bone marrow donors schwartz discovered that individuals with strong personal norms and those who attribute more responsibility to themselves are more inclined to participate in bone marrow donation similar findings were observed in a 1986 study by piliavin and libby focusing on blood donors these studies suggest that personal norms lead to the activation of moral norms leading individuals to feel compelled to help others abigail marsh has described psychopaths as the opposite group of people to extreme altruists and has conducted a few research comparing these two groups of individuals utilising techniques such as brain imaging and behavioural experiments marshs team observed that kidney donors tend to have larger amygdala sizes and exhibit better abilities in recognizing fearful expressions compared to psychopathic individuals furthermore an improved ability to recognize fear has been associated with an increase in prosocial behaviours including greater charity contribution rand and epstein explored the behaviours of 51 carnegie hero medal recipients demonstrating how extreme altruistic behaviours often stem from system i of the dual process theory which leads to rapid and intuitive behaviours additionally a separate by carlson et al indicated that such prosocial behaviours are prevalent in emergencies where immediate actions are required this discovery has led to ethical debates particularly in the context of living organ donation where laws regarding this issue differ by country as observed in extreme altruists these decisions are made intuitively which may reflect insufficient consideration critics are concerned about whether this rapid decision encompasses a thorough costbenefit analysis and question the appropriateness of exposing donors to such risk one finding suggests how extreme altruists exhibit lower levels of social discounting as compared to others with that meaning extreme altruists place a higher value on the welfare of strangers than a typical person does analysis of 676 carnegie hero award recipients and another study on 243 rescuing acts reveal that a significant proportion of rescuers come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds johnson attributes the distribution to the highrisk occupations that are more prevalent between lower socioeconomic groups another hypothesis proposed by lyons is that individuals from these groups may perceive they have less to lose when engaging in highrisk extreme altruistic behaviours possible explanations evolutionary theories such as the kinselection reciprocity vested interest and punishment either contradict or do not fully explain the concept of extreme altruism as a result considerable research has attempted for a separate explanation for this behaviour research suggests that males are more likely to engage in heroic and risktaking behaviours due to a preference among females for such traits these extreme altruistic behaviours could serve to act as an unconscious signal to showcase superior power and ability compared to ordinary individuals when an extreme altruist survives a highrisk situation they send an honest signal of quality three qualities hypothesized to be exhibited by extreme altruists which could be interpreted as signals are 1 traits that are difficult to fake 2 a willingness to help and 3 generous behaviours the empathy altruism hypothesis appears to align with the concept of extreme altruism without contradiction the hypothesis was supported with further brain scanning research which indicates how this group of people demonstrate a higher level of empathy concern the level of empathy concern then triggers activation in specific brain regions urging the individual to engage in heroic behaviours while most altruistic behaviours offer some form of benefit extreme altruism may sometimes result from a mistake where the victim does not reciprocate considering the impulsive characteristic of extreme altruists some researchers suggest that these individuals have made a wrong judgement during the costbenefit analysis furthermore extreme altruism might be a rare variation of altruism where they lie towards to ends of a normal distribution in the us the annual prevalence rate per capita is less than 000005 this shows the rarity of such behaviours genetics oxtr cd38 comt drd4 drd5 igf2 and gabrb2 are candidate genes for influencing altruistic behaviorexpand on how altruism was measured to come up with these results digital altruism digital altruism is the notion that some are willing to freely share information based on the principle of reciprocity and in the belief that in the end everyone benefits from sharing information via the internet there are three types of digital altruism 1 everyday digital altruism involving expedience ease moral engagement and conformity 2 creative digital altruism involving creativity heightened moral engagement and cooperation and 3 cocreative digital altruism involving creativity moral engagement and meta cooperative efforts see also notes

philosophers have generally ignored or rejected rands philosophy arguing that she has a polemical approach and that her work lacks methodological rigor her writings have politically influenced some rightlibertarians and conservatives the objectivist movement circulates her ideas both to the public and in academic settings life early life rand was born alisa zinovyevna rosenbaum on february 2

studios in 1932 although it was never produced her courtroom drama night of january 16th first staged in hollywood in 1934 reopened successfully on broadway in 1935 each night a jury was selected from members of the audience based on its vote one of two different endings would be performed rand and oconnor moved to new york city in december 1934 so she could handle revisions for the broadway production her first novel the semiautobiographical we the living was published in 1936 set in soviet russia it focuses on the struggle between the individual and the state initial sales were slow and the american publisher let it go out of print although european editions continued to sell she adapted the story as a stage play but the broadway production closed in less than a week after the success of her later novels rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies rand started her next major novel the fountainhead in december 1935 but took a break from it in 1937 to write her novella anthem the novella presents a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that the word i has been forgotten and replaced with we protagonists equality 72521 and liberty 53000 eventually escape the collectivistic society and rediscover the word i it was published in england in 1938 but rand could not find an american publisher at that time as with we the living rands later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946 and this sold over 35 million copies the fountainhead and political activism during the 1940s rand became politically active she and her husband were fulltime volunteers for republican wendell willkies 1940 presidential campaign this work put her in contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to freemarket capitalism she became friends with journalist henry hazlitt who introduced her to the austrian school economist ludwig von mises despite philosophical differences with them rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career and they expressed admiration for her mises once called her the most courageous man in america a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said man instead of woman rand became friends with libertarian writer isabel paterson rand questioned her about american history and politics during their many meetings and gave paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book the god of the machine rands first major success as a writer came in 1943 with the fountainhead a novel about an uncompromising architect named howard roark and his struggle against what rand described as secondhanders who attempt to live through others placing others above themselves twelve publishers rejected it before bobbsmerrill company accepted it at the insistence of editor archibald ogden who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it while completing the novel rand was prescribed the amphetamine benzedrine to fight fatigue the drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks rest her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to mood swings and outbursts described by some of her later associates the success of the fountainhead brought rand fame and financial security in 1943 she sold the film rights to warner bros and returned to hollywood to write the screenplay producer hal b wallis then hired her as a screenwriter and scriptdoctor for screenplays including love letters and you came along rand became involved with the anticommunist motion picture alliance for the preservation of american ideals and american writers association in 1947 during the second red scare she testified as a friendly witness before the united states house unamerican activities committee that the 1944 film song of russia grossly misrepresented conditions in the soviet union portraying life there as much better and happier than it was she also wanted to criticize the lauded 1946 film the best years of our lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world but was not allowed to do so when asked after the hearings about her feelings on the investigations effectiveness rand described the process as futile after several delays the film version of the fountainhead was released in 1949 although it used rands screenplay with minimal alterations she disliked the movie from beginning to end and complained about its editing the acting and other elements atlas shrugged and objectivism following the publication of the fountainhead rand received many letters from readers some of whom the book had influenced profoundly in 1951 rand moved from los angeles to new york city where she gathered a group of these admirers who met at rands apartment on weekends to discuss philosophy the group included future chair of the federal reserve alan greenspan a young psychology student named nathan blumenthal later nathaniel branden and his wife barbara and barbaras cousin leonard peikoff later rand began allowing them to read the manuscript drafts of her new novel atlas shrugged in 1954 her close relationship with nathaniel branden turned into a romantic affair with the knowledge of their spouses published in 1957 atlas shrugged is considered rands magnum opus she described the novels theme as the role of the mind in mans existenceand as a corollary the demonstration of a new moral philosophy the morality of rational selfinterest it advocates the core tenets of rands philosophy of objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement the plot involves a dystopian united states in which the most creative industrialists scientists and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a hidden valley where they build an independent free economy the novels hero and leader of the strike john galt describes it as stopping the motor of the world by withdrawing the minds of individuals contributing most to the nations wealth and achievements the novel contains an exposition of objectivism in a lengthy monologue delivered by galt despite many negative reviews atlas shrugged became an international bestseller but the reaction of intellectuals to the novel discouraged and depressed rand atlas shrugged was her last completed work of fiction marking the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher in 1958 nathaniel branden established the nathaniel branden lectures later incorporated as the nathaniel branden institute nbi to promote rands philosophy through public lectures he and rand cofounded the objectivist newsletter later renamed the objectivist in 1962 to circulate articles about her ideas she later republished some of these articles in book form rand was unimpressed by many of the nbi students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her critics including some former nbi students and branden himself later described the culture of the nbi as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for rand some described the nbi or the objectivist movement as a cult or religion rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers some former nbi students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated and the problem was concentrated among rands closest followers in new york later years throughout the 1960s and 70s rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through nonfiction works and speeches at colleges and universities she began delivering annual lectures at the ford hall forum and responded to audience questions often taking controversial stances on the political and social issues of the day these included supporting abortion rights opposing the vietnam war and the military draft but condemning many draft dodgers as bums supporting israel in the yom kippur war of 1973 against a coalition of arab nations as civilized men fighting savages claiming european colonists had the right to invade and take land inhabited by american indians and calling homosexuality immoral and disgusting despite advocating the repeal of all laws concerning it she endorsed several republican candidates for president of the united states most strongly barry goldwater in 1964 in 1964 nathaniel branden began an affair with the young actress patrecia scott whom he later married nathaniel and barbara branden kept the affair hidden from rand when she learned of it in 1968 though her romantic involvement with branden was already over rand ended her relationship with both brandens and the nbi was closed she published an article in the objectivist repudiating nathaniel branden for dishonesty and irrational behavior in his private life in subsequent years rand and several more of her closest associates parted company rand had surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking in 1976 she retired from her newsletter and after her initial objections allowed a social worker employed by her attorney to enroll her in social security and medicare her activities in the objectivist movement declined especially after her husbands death on november 9 1979 one of her final projects was work on a nevercompleted television adaptation of atlas shrugged on march 6 1982 rand died of heart failure at her home in new york city her funeral included a 6 floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign in her will rand named peikoff as her heir literary approach influences and reception rand described her approach to literature as romantic realism she wanted her fiction to present the world as it could be and should be rather than as it was this approach led her to create highly stylized situations and characters her fiction typically has protagonists who are heroic individualists depicted as fit and attractive her villains support duty and collectivist moral ideals rand often describes them as unattractive and some have names that suggest negative traits such as wesley mouch in atlas shrugged rand considered plot a critical element of literature and her stories typically have what biographer anne heller described as tight elaborate fastpaced plotting romantic triangles are a common plot element in rands fiction in most of her novels and plays the main female character is romantically involved with at least two men influences in school rand read works by fyodor dostoevsky victor hugo edmond rostand and friedrich schiller who became her favorites she considered them to be among the top rank of romantic writers because of their focus on moral themes and their skill at constructing plots hugo was an important influence on her writing especially her approach to plotting in the introduction she wrote for an englishlanguage edition of his novel ninetythree rand called him the greatest novelist in world literature although rand disliked most russian literature her depictions of her heroes show the influence of the russian symbolists and other nineteenthcentury russian writing most notably the 1863 novel what is to be done by nikolay chernyshevsky scholars of russian literature see in chernyshevskys character rakhmetov an ascetic revolutionist the template for rands literary heroes and heroines rands experience of the russian revolution and early communist russia influenced the portrayal of her villains beyond we the living which is set in russia this influence can be seen in the ideas and rhetoric of ellsworth toohey in the fountainhead and in the destruction of the economy in atlas shrugged rands descriptive style echoes her early career writing scenarios and scripts for movies her novels have many narrative descriptions that resemble early hollywood movie scenarios they often follow common film editing conventions such as having a broad establishing shot description of a scene followed by closeup details and her descriptions of women characters often take a male gaze perspective contemporary reviews the first reviews rand received were for night of january 16th reviews of the broadway production were largely positive but rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer although rand believed that we the living was not widely reviewed over 200 publications published approximately 125 different reviews overall they were more positive than those she received for her later work anthem received little review attention both for its first publication in england and for subsequent reissues rands first bestseller the fountainhead received far fewer reviews than we the living and reviewers opinions were mixed lorine pruettes positive review in the new york times which called the author a writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly was one that rand greatly appreciated there were other positive reviews but rand dismissed most of them for either misunderstanding her message or for being in unimportant publications some negative reviews said the novel was too long others called the characters unsympathetic and rands style offensively pedestrian atlas shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative atlas shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications but rand scholar mimi reisel gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest putdowns with reviews including comments that it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity whittaker chambers wrote what was later called the novels most notorious review for the conservative magazine national review he accused rand of supporting a godless system which he related to that of the soviets claiming from almost any page of atlas shrugged a voice can be heard  commanding to a gas chambergo  rands nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels the tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book for the new intellectual was similar to that for atlas shrugged philosopher sidney hook likened her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the soviet union and author gore vidal called her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality these reviews set the pattern for reaction to her ideas among liberal critics her subsequent books got progressively less review attention academic assessments of rands fiction academic consideration of rand as a literary figure during her life was limited mimi reisel gladstein could not find any scholarly articles about rands novels when she began researching her in 1973 and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s since her death scholars of english and american literature have continued largely to ignore her work although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s several academic book series about important authors cover rand and her works as do popular study guides like cliffsnotes and sparknotes in the literary encyclopedia entry for rand written in 2001 john david lewis declared that rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation in 2019 lisa duggan described rands fiction as popular and influential on many readers despite being easy to criticize for her cartoonish characters and melodramatic plots her rigid moralizing her middle to lowbrow aesthetic preferences  and philosophical strivings philosophy rand called her philosophy objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute she considered objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics epistemology ethics aesthetics and political philosophy metaphysics and epistemology in metaphysics rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religion rand believed in free will as a form of agent causation and rejected determinism in aesthetics rand defined art as a selective recreation of reality according to an artists metaphysical valuejudgments according to her art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be grasped easily thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness as a writer the art form rand focused on most closely was literature in works such as the romantic manifesto and the art of fiction she described romanticism the approach that most accurately reflects the existence of human free will in epistemology rand considered all knowledge to be based on forming higher levels of understanding from sense perception the validity of which she considered axiomatic she described reason as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by mans senses rand rejected all claims of nonperceptual knowledge including  instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing  in her introduction to objectivist epistemology rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analyticsynthetic dichotomy she believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy commentators including hazel barnes nathaniel branden and albert ellis have criticized rands focus on the importance of reason barnes and ellis said rand was too dismissive of emotion and failed to recognize its importance in human life branden said rands emphasis on reason led her to denigrate emotions and create unrealistic expectations of how consistently rational human beings should be ethics and politics in ethics rand argued for rational and ethical egoism rational selfinterest as the guiding moral principle she said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself rand referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title in it she presented her solution to the isought problem by describing a metaethical theory that based morality in the needs of mans survival qua man which requires the use of a rational mind she condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in atlas shrugged that force and mind are opposites rands ethics and politics are the most criticized areas of her philosophy several authors including robert nozick and william f oneill in two of the earliest academic critiques of her ideas said she failed in her attempt to solve the isought problem critics have called her definitions of egoism and altruism biased and inconsistent with normal usage critics from religious traditions oppose her atheism and her rejection of altruism rands political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights she considered laissezfaire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on protecting those rights rand opposed collectivism and statism which she considered to include many specific forms of government such as communism fascism socialism theocracy and the welfare state her preferred form of government was a constitutional republic that is limited to the protection of individual rights although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian rand preferred the term radical for capitalism she worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics rand denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism she rejected anarchism as a naive theory based in subjectivism that would lead to collectivism in practice several critics including nozick have said her attempt to justify individual rights based on egoism fails others like libertarian philosopher michael huemer have gone further saying that her support of egoism and her support of individual rights are inconsistent positions some critics like roy childs have said that her opposition to the initiation of force should lead to support of anarchism rather than limited government relationship to other philosophers except for aristotle thomas aquinas and classical liberals rand was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her acknowledging aristotle as her greatest influence rand remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three asaristotle aquinas and ayn rand in a 1959 interview with mike wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to aristotle the only philosopher who ever influenced me in an article for the claremont review of books political scientist charles murray criticized rands claim that her only philosophical debt was to aristotle he asserted her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as john locke and friedrich nietzsche rand took early inspiration from nietzsche and scholars have found indications of this in rands private journals in 1928 she alluded to his idea of the superman in notes for an unwritten novel whose protagonist was inspired by the murderer william edward hickman there are other indications of nietzsches influence in passages from the first edition of we the living which rand later revised and in her overall writing style by the time she wrote the fountainhead rand had turned against nietzsches ideas and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed rands views also may have been influenced by the promotion of egoism among the russian nihilists including chernyshevsky and dmitry pisarev although there is no direct evidence that she read them rand considered immanuel kant her philosophical opposite and the most evil man in mankinds history she believed his epistemology undermined reason and his ethics opposed selfinterest philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued she misinterpreted kant and exaggerated their differences she was also critical of plato and viewed his differences with aristotle on questions of metaphysics and epistemology as the primary conflict in the history of philosophy rands relationship with contemporary philosophers was mostly antagonistic she was not an academic and did not participate in academic discourse she was dismissive of critics and wrote about ideas she disagreed with in a polemical manner without indepth analysis she was in turn viewed very negatively by many academic philosophers who dismissed her as an unimportant figure who should not be considered a philosopher or given any serious response early academic reaction during rands lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars in 1967 john hospers discussed rands ethical ideas in the second edition of his textbook an introduction to philosophical analysis that same year hazel barnes included a chapter critiquing objectivism in her book an existentialist ethics when the first fulllength academic book about rands philosophy appeared in 1971 its author declared writing about rand a treacherous undertaking that could lead to guilt by association for taking her seriously a few articles about rands ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982 many of them in the personalist one of these was on the randian argument by libertarian philosopher robert nozick who criticized her metaethical arguments in the same journal other philosophers argued that nozick misstated rands case in an article responding to nozick douglas den uyl and douglas b rasmussen defended her positions but described her style as literary hyperbolic and emotional after her death interest in rands ideas increased gradually the philosophic thought of ayn rand a 1984 collection of essays about objectivism edited by den uyl and rasmussen was the first academic book about rands ideas published after her death in one essay political writer jack wheeler wrote that despite the incessant bombast and continuous venting of randian rage rands ethics are a most immense achievement the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought in 1987 the ayn rand society was founded as an affiliate of the american philosophical association in a 1995 entry about rand in contemporary women philosophers jenny a heyl described a divergence in how different academic specialties viewed rand she said that rands philosophy is regularly omitted from academic philosophy yet throughout literary academia ayn rand is considered a philosopher writing in the 1998 edition of the routledge encyclopedia of philosophy political theorist chandran kukathas summarized the mainstream philosophical reception of her work in two parts he said most commentators view her ethical argument as an unconvincing variant of aristotles ethics and her political theory is of little interest because it is marred by an illthought out and unsystematic effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism the journal of ayn rand studies a multidisciplinary peerreviewed academic journal devoted to the study of rand and her ideas was established in 1999 21stcentury academic reaction in 2009 historian jennifer burns identified an explosion of scholarship since 2000 although as of that year few universities included rand or objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area from 2002 to 2012 over 60 colleges and universities accepted grants from the charitable foundation of bbt corporation that required teaching rands ideas or works in some cases the grants were controversial or even rejected because of the requirement to teach about rand in a 2010 essay for the cato institute huemer argued very few people find rands ideas convincing especially her ethics he attributed the attention she receives to her being a compelling writer especially as a novelist in 2012 the pennsylvania state university press agreed to take over publication of the journal of ayn rand studies and the university of pittsburgh press launched an ayn rand society philosophical studies series based on the societys proceedings the fall 2012 update to the entry about rand in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy said that only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously that same year political scientist alan wolfe dismissed rand as a nonperson among academics an attitude that writer ben murnane later described as the traditional academic view of rand in a 2018 article for aeon philosopher skye c cleary wrote philosophers love to hate ayn rand its trendy to scoff at any mention of her however cleary said that because many people take rands ideas seriously philosophers need to treat the ayn rand phenomenon seriously and provide refutations rather than ignoring her in 2020 media critic eric burns said rand is surely the most engaging philosopher of my lifetime but nobody in the academe pays any attention to her neither as an author nor a philosopher that same year the editor of a collection of critical essays about rand said academics who disapproved of her ideas had long held a stubborn resolve to ignore or ridicule her work but he believed more were engaging with her work in recent years legacy popular interest with over 37 million copies sold 2020 rands books continue to be read widely a survey conducted for the library of congress and the book of the month club in 1991 asked club members to name the most influential book in their lives rands atlas shrugged was the second most popular choice after the bible although rands influence has been greatest in the united states there has been international interest in her work rands contemporary admirers included fellow novelists like ira levin kay nolte smith and l neil smith she has influenced later writers like erika holzer terry goodkind and comic book artist steve ditko rand provided a positive view of business and subsequently many business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work businessmen such as john allison of bbt and ed snider of comcast spectacor have funded the promotion of rands ideas television shows movies songs and video games have referred to rand and her works throughout her life she was the subject of many articles in popular magazines as well as booklength critiques by authors such as the psychologist albert ellis and trinity foundation president john w robbins rand or characters based on her figure prominently in novels by american authors including kay nolte smith mary gaitskill matt ruff and tobias wolff nick gillespie former editorinchief of reason remarked rands is a tortured immortality one in which shes as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist jibes at rand as cold and inhuman run through the popular culture two movies have been made about rands life a 1997 documentary film ayn rand a sense of life was nominated for the academy award for best documentary feature the passion of ayn rand a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name won several awards rands image also appears on a 1999 us postage stamp illustrated by artist nick gaetano rands works most commonly anthem or the fountainhead are sometimes assigned as secondary school reading since 2002 the ayn rand institute has provided free copies of rands novels to teachers who promise to include the books in their curriculum the institute had distributed 45 million copies in the us and canada by the end of 2020 in 2017 rand was added to the required reading list for the a level politics exam in the united kingdom political influence although she rejected the labels conservative and libertarian rand has had a continuing influence on rightwing politics and libertarianism rand is often considered one of the three most important women along with rose wilder lane and isabel paterson in the early development of modern american libertarianism david nolan one founder of the libertarian party said that without ayn rand the libertarian movement would not exist in his history of that movement journalist brian doherty described her as the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large political scientist andrew koppelman called her the most widely read libertarian historian jennifer burns referred to her as the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right the political figures who cite rand as an influence are usually conservatives often members of the republican party despite rand taking some atypical positions for a conservative like being prochoice and an atheist she faced intense opposition from william f buckley jr and other contributors to the conservative national review magazine which published numerous criticisms of her writings and ideas nevertheless a 1987 article in the new york times called her the reagan administrations novelist laureate republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels she has influenced some conservative politicians outside the us such as sajid javid in the united kingdom siv jensen in norway and ayelet shaked in israel the financial crisis of 20072008 renewed interest in her works especially atlas shrugged which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis opinion articles compared realworld events with the novels plot signs mentioning rand and her fictional hero john galt appeared at tea party protests there was increased criticism of her ideas especially from the political left critics blamed the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets particularly through her influence on alan greenspan in 2015 adam weiner said that through greenspan rand had effectively chucked a ticking time bomb into the boiler room of the us economy lisa duggan said that rands novels had incalculable impact in encouraging the spread of neoliberal political ideas in 2021 cass sunstein said rands ideas could be seen in the tax and regulatory policies of the trump administration which he attributed to the enduring influence of rands fiction objectivist movement after the closure of the nathaniel branden institute the objectivist movement continued in other forms in the 1970s peikoff began delivering courses on objectivism in 1979 peter schwartz started a newsletter called the intellectual activist which rand endorsed she also endorsed the objectivist forum a bimonthly magazine founded by objectivist philosopher harry binswanger which ran from 1980 to 1987 in 1985 peikoff worked with businessman ed snider to establish the ayn rand institute a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting rands ideas and works in 1990 after an ideological disagreement with peikoff david

worlds tenth largest nation by area and the largest nation in africa more than 200 times as large as the continents smallest country the gambia with a population of 44 million algeria is the tenthmost populous country in africa and the 32ndmost populous country in the world the capital and largest city is algiers located in the far north on the mediterranean coast centuries of arab migration to the maghreb since the 7th century shifted the demographic scope in algeria the spanish expansionism led to the establishment of the regency of algiers in 1516 a state that attracted people from all over the mediterranean making its capital algiers one of the largest wealthiest and most cosmopolitan cities in the world its decline in the 19th century resulted in its invasion by the french in 1830 the conquest and subsequent pacification of the country that ensued lasted until 1903 and led to algeria becoming an integral part of france in 1848 and home to over a million european settlers while the native algerians remained the majority of the population during this period it is estimated that they fell by up to onethird due to warfare disease and starvation the sétif and guelma massacre in 1945 marked a turning point in francoalgerian relations and sparked the algerian war which concluded with algeria gaining its independence on 5 july 1962 and the proclamation of the peoples democratic

abbreviated as radp etymology algerias name derives from the city of algiers which in turn derives from the arabic aljazāʾir الجزائر the islands in reference to four small islands off its coast a truncated form of the older jazāʾir banī mazghanna جزائر بني مزغنة islands of bani mazghannafebruary 2013february 2013 the name was given by buluggin ibn ziri after he established the city on the ruins of the phoenician city of icosium in 950 it was employed by medieval geographers such as muhammad alidrisi and yaqut alhamawi the ottoman empire extended the name of aljazāir over the entire country deriving it from the name of the capital city thus it shares its etymology with numerous other places such as alzira in valencia algeciras in andalusia lezíria in portugal cizre in turkey gżira in malta the nile island of gezira in egypt and the state of gezira in sudan history prehistory and ancient history around 18millionyearold stone artifacts from ain hanech algeria were considered to represent the oldest archaeological materials in north africa stone artifacts and cutmarked bones that were excavated from two nearby deposits at ain boucherit are estimated to be 19 million years old and even older stone artifacts to be as old as 24 million years hence the ain boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited the mediterranean fringe in northern africa much earlier than previously thought the evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from east africa or a possible multipleorigin scenario of stone technology in both east and north africa neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the levalloisian and mousterian styles 43000 bc similar to those in the levant algeria was the site of the highest state of development of middle paleolithic flake tool techniques tools of this era starting about 30000 bc are called aterian after the archaeological site of bir el ater south of tebessa the earliest blade industries in north africa are called iberomaurusian located mainly in the oran region this industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the maghreb between 15000 and 10000 bc neolithic civilization animal domestication and agriculture developed in the saharan and mediterranean maghreb perhaps as early as 11000 bc or as late as between 6000 and 2000 bc this life richly depicted in the tassili najjer paintings predominated in algeria until the classical period the mixture of peoples of north africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called berbers who are the indigenous peoples of northern africa from their principal center of power at carthage the carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the north african coast by 600 bc a phoenician presence existed at tipasa east of cherchell hippo regius modern annaba and rusicade modern skikda these settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages as carthaginian power grew its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically berber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture manufacturing trade and political organisation supported several states trade links between carthage and the berbers in the interior grew but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others by the early 4th century bc berbers formed the single largest element of the carthaginian army in the revolt of the mercenaries berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 bc after being unpaid following the defeat of carthage in the first punic war they succeeded in obtaining control of much of carthages north african territory and they minted coins bearing the name libyan used in greek to describe natives of north africa the carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the romans in the punic wars in 146 bc the city of carthage was destroyed as carthaginian power waned the influence of berber leaders in the hinterland grew by the 2nd century bc several large but loosely administered berber kingdoms had emerged two of them were established in numidia behind the coastal areas controlled by carthage west of numidia lay mauretania which extended across the moulouya river in modernday morocco to the atlantic ocean the high point of berber civilisation unequalled until the coming of the almohads and almoravids more than a millennium later was reached during the reign of masinissa in the 2nd century bc after masinissas death in 148 bc the berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times masinissas line survived until 24 ad when the remaining berber territory was annexed to the roman empire for several centuries algeria was ruled by the romans who founded many colonies in the region algeria is the second country in the world after italy home to the largest number of roman sites and remains among the most alive and well preserved rome after getting rid of its powerful rival carthage in the year 146 bc decided a century later to include numidia to become the new master of north africa they built more than 500 cities like the rest of north africa algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products saint augustine was the bishop of hippo regius modernday annaba algeria located in the roman province of africa the germanic vandals of geiseric moved into north africa in 429 and by 435 controlled coastal numidia they did not make any significant settlement on the land as they were harassed by local tribesfebruary 2021 in fact by the time the byzantines arrived leptis magna was abandoned and the msellata region was occupied by the indigenous laguatan who had been busy facilitating an amazigh political military and cultural revival furthermore during the rule of the romans byzantines vandals carthaginians and ottomans the berber people were the only or one of the few in north africa who remained independent the berber people were so resistant that even during the muslim conquest of north africa they still had control and possession over their mountains the collapse of the western roman empire led to the establishment of a native kingdom based in altava modernday algeria known as the mauroroman kingdom it was succeeded by another kingdom based in altava the kingdom of altava during the reign of kusaila its territory extended from the region of modernday fez in the west to the western aurès and later kairaouan and the interior of ifriqiya in the east middle ages after negligible resistance from the locals muslim arabs of the umayyad caliphate conquered algeria in the early 8th century large numbers of the indigenous berber people converted to islam christians berber and latin speakers remained in the great majority in tunisia until the end of the 9th century and muslims only became a vast majority some time in the 10th after the fall of the umayyad caliphate numerous local dynasties emerged including the rustamids aghlabids fatimids zirids hammadids almoravids almohads and the zayyanids the christians left in three waves after the initial conquest in the 10th century and the 11th the last were evacuated to sicily by the normans and the few remaining died out in the 14th century during the middle ages north africa was home to many great scholars saints and sovereigns including judah ibn quraysh the first grammarian to mention semitic and berber languages the great sufi masters sidi boumediene abu madyan and sidi el houari and the emirs abd al mumin and yāghmūrasen it was during this time that the fatimids or children of fatima daughter of muhammad came to the maghreb these fatimids went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the maghreb hejaz and the levant boasting a secular inner government as well as a powerful army and navy made up primarily of arabs and levantines extending from algeria to their capital state of cairo the fatimid caliphate began to collapse when its governors the zirids seceded to punish them the fatimids sent the arab banu hilal and banu sulaym against them the resultant war is recounted in the epic tāghribāt in altāghrībāt the amazigh zirid hero khālīfā alzānatī asks daily for duels to defeat the hilalan hero ābu zayd alhilalī and many other arab knights in a string of victories the zirids however were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of arab customs and culture the indigenous amazigh tribes however remained largely independent and depending on tribe location and time controlled varying parts of the maghreb at times unifying it as under the fatimids the fatimid islamic state also known as fatimid caliphate made an islamic empire that included north africa sicily palestine jordan lebanon syria egypt the red sea coast of africa tihamah hejaz and yemen caliphates from northern africa traded with the other empires of their time as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other islamic states during the islamic era the berber people historically consisted of several tribes the two main branches were the botr and barnès tribes who were divided into tribes and again into subtribes each region of the maghreb contained several tribes for example sanhadja houara zenata masmouda kutama awarba and berghwata all these tribes made independent territorial decisions several amazigh dynasties emerged during the middle ages in the maghreb and other nearby lands ibn khaldun provides a table summarising the amazigh dynasties of the maghreb region the zirid ifranid maghrawa almoravid hammadid almohad merinid abdalwadid wattasid meknassa and hafsid dynasties both of the hammadid and zirid empires as well as the fatimids established their rule in all of the maghreb countries the zirids ruled land in what is now algeria tunisia morocco libya spain malta and italy the hammadids captured and held important regions such as ouargla constantine sfax susa algiers tripoli and fez establishing their rule in every country in the maghreb region the fatimids which was created and established by the kutama berbers conquered all of north africa as well as sicily and parts of the middle east following the berber revolt numerous independent states emerged across the maghreb in algeria the rustamid kingdom was established the rustamid realm stretched from tafilalt in morocco to the nafusa mountains in libya including south central and western tunisia therefore including territory in all of the modern day maghreb countries in the south the rustamid realm expanded to the modern borders of mali and included territory in mauritania once extending their control over all of the maghreb part of spain and briefly over sicily originating from modern algeria the zirids only controlled modern ifriqiya by the 11th century the zirids recognized nominal suzerainty of the fatimid caliphs of cairo el muizz the zirid ruler decided to end this recognition and declared his independence the zirids also fought against other zenata kingdoms for example the maghrawa a berber dynasty originating from algeria and which at one point was a dominant power in the maghreb ruling over much of morocco and western algeria including fez sijilmasa aghmat oujda most of the sous and draa and reaching as far as msila and the zab in algeria as the fatimid state was at the time too weak to attempt a direct invasion they found another means of revenge between the nile and the red sea were living bedouin nomad tribes expelled from arabia for their disruption and turbulency the banu hilal and the banu sulaym for example who regularly disrupted farmers in the nile valley since the nomads would often loot their farms the then fatimid vizier decided to destroy what he could not control and broke a deal with the chiefs of these beduouin tribes the fatimids even gave them money to leave whole tribes set off with women children elders animals and camping equipment some stopped on the way especially in cyrenaica where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in ifriqiya by the gabes region arriving 1051 the zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide but with each encounter the last under the walls of kairouan his troops were defeated and the arabs remained masters of the battlefield the arabs usually did not take control over the cities instead looting them and destroying them the invasion kept going and in 1057 the arabs spread on the high plains of constantine where they encircled the qalaa of banu hammad capital of the hammadid emirate as they had done in kairouan a few decades ago from there they gradually gained the upper algiers and oran plains some of these territories were forcibly taken back by the almohads in the second half of the 12th century the influx of bedouin tribes was a major factor in the linguistic cultural arabization of the maghreb and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant ibn khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by banu hilal tribes had become completely arid desert the almohads originating from modern day morocco although founded by a man originating from modern day algeria known as abd almumin would soon take control over the maghreb during the time of the almohad dynasty abd almumins tribe the koumïa were the main supporters of the throne and the most important body of the empire defeating the weakening almoravid empire and taking control over morocco in 1147 they pushed into algeria in 1152 taking control over tlemcen oran and algiers wrestling control from the hilian arabs and by the same year they defeated hammadids who controlled eastern algeria following their decisive defeat in the battle of las navas de tolosa in 1212 the almohads began collapsing and in 1235 the governor of modernday western algeria yaghmurasen ibn zyan declared his independence and established the kingdom of tlemcen and the zayyanid dynasty warring with the almohad forces attempting to restore control over algeria for 13 years they defeated the almohads in 1248 after killing their caliph in a successful ambush near oujda the zayyanids retained their control over algeria for 3 centuries much of the eastern territories of algeria were under the authority of the hafsid dynasty although the emirate of bejaia encompassing the algerian territories of the hafsids would occasionally be independent from central tunisian control at their peak the zayyanid kingdom included all of morocco as its vassal to the west and in the east reached as far as tunis which they captured during the reign of abu tashfin after several conflicts with local barbary pirates sponsored by the zayyanid sultans spain decided to invade algeria and defeat the native kingdom of tlemcen in 1505 they invaded and captured mers el kébir and in 1509 after a bloody siege they conquered oran following their decisive victories over the algerians in the westerncoastal areas of algeria the spanish decided to get bolder and invaded more algerian cities in 1510 they led a series of sieges and attacks taking over bejaia in a large siege and leading a semisuccessful siege against algiers they also besieged tlemcen in 1511 they took control over cherchell and jijel and attacked mostaganem where although they were not able to conquer the city they were able to force a tribute on them early modern era in 1516 the turkish privateer brothers aruj and hayreddin barbarossa who operated successfully under the hafsids moved their base of operations to algiers they succeeded in conquering jijel and algiers from the spaniards with help from the locals who saw them as liberators from the christians but the brothers eventually assassinated the local noble salim altumi and took control over the city and the surrounding regions their state is known as the regency of algiers when aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of tlemcen hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of algiers the ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some 2000 janissaries with the aid of this force and native algerians hayreddin conquered the whole area between constantine and oran although the city of oran remained in spanish hands until 1792 the next beylerbey was hayreddins son hasan who assumed the position in 1544 he was a kouloughli or of mixed origins as his mother was an algerian mooresse until 1587 beylerbeylik of algiers was governed by beylerbeys who served terms with no fixed limits subsequently with the institution of a regular administration governors with the title of pasha ruled for threeyear terms the pasha was assisted by an autonomous janissary unit known in algeria as the ojaq who were led by an agha discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid1600s because they were not paid regularly and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha as a result the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659 the barbary pirates preyed on christian and other nonislamic shipping in the western mediterranean sea the pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves they also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives according to robert davis from the 16th to 19th century pirates captured 1 million to 125 million europeans as slaves they often made raids on european coastal towns to capture christian slaves to sell at slave markets in north africa and other parts of the ottoman empire in 1544 for example hayreddin barbarossa captured the island of ischia taking 4000 prisoners and enslaved some 9000 inhabitants of lipari almost the entire population in 1551 the ottoman governor of algiers turgut reis enslaved the entire population of the maltese island of gozo barbary pirates often attacked the balearic islands the threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of formentera the introduction of broadsail ships from the beginning of the 17th century allowed them to branch out into the atlantic in july 1627 two pirate ships from algiers under the command of dutch pirate jan janszoon sailed as far as iceland raiding and capturing slaves two weeks earlier another pirate ship from salé in morocco had also raided in iceland some of the slaves brought to algiers were later ransomed back to iceland but some chose to stay in algeria in 1629 pirate ships from algeria raided the faroe islands in 1659 the janissaries stationned in algiers also known commonly as the odjak of algiers and the reis or the company of corsair captains rebelled they removed the ottoman viceroy from power and placed one of its own in power the new leader received the title of agha then dey in 1671 and the right to select passed to the divan a council of some sixty military senior officers thus algiers became a sovereign military republic it was at first dominated by the odjak but by the 18th century it had become the deys instrument although algiers remained nominally part of the ottoman empire in reality they acted independently from the rest of the empire and often had wars with other ottoman subjects and territories such as the beylik of tunis the dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat the dey was elected for a life term but in the 159 years 16711830 that the system was in place fourteen of the twentynine deys were assassinated despite usurpation military coups and occasional mob rule the daytoday operation of the deylikal government was remarkably orderly although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest autonomous tribal states were tolerated and the regencys authority was seldom applied in the kabylia although in 1730 the regency was able to take control over the kingdom of kuku in western kabylia many cities in the northern parts of the algerian desert paid taxes to algiers or one of its beys barbary raids in the mediterranean continued to attack spanish merchant shipping and as a result the spanish empire launched an invasion in 1775 then the spanish navy bombarded algiers in 1783 and 1784 for the attack in 1784 the spanish fleet was to be joined by ships from such traditional enemies of algiers as naples portugal and the knights of malta over 20000 cannonballs were fired but all these military campaigns were doomed and spain had to ask for peace in 1786 and paid 1 million pesos to the dey in 1792 algiers took back oran and mers el kébir the two last spanish strongholds in algeria in the same year they conquered the moroccan rif and oujda which they then abandoned in 1795 in the 19th century algerian pirates forged affiliations with caribbean powers paying a license tax in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels attacks by algerian pirates on american merchantmen resulted in the first and second barbary wars which ended the attacks on us ships in 1815 a year later a combined anglodutch fleet under the command of lord exmouth bombarded algiers to stop similar attacks on european fishermen these efforts proved successful although algerian piracy would continue until the french conquest in 1830 french colonization 18301962 under the pretext of a slight to their consul the french invaded and captured algiers in 1830 according to several historians the methods used by the french to establish control over algeria reached genocidal proportions historian ben kiernan wrote on the french conquest of algeria by 1875 the french conquest was complete the war had killed approximately 825000 indigenous algerians since 1830 french losses from 1831 to 1851 were 92329 dead in the hospital and only 3336 killed in action in 1872 the algerian population stood at about 29 million french policy was predicated on civilising the country the slave trade and piracy in algeria ceased following the french conquest the conquest of algeria by the french took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed a combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous algerian population to decline by nearly onethird from 1830 to 1872 on 17 september 1860 napoleon iii declared our first duty is to take care of the happiness of the three million arabs whom the fate of arms has brought under our domination during this time only kabylia resisted the kabylians were not colonized until after the mokrani revolt in 1871july 2022 alexis de tocqueville wrote and never completed an unpublished essay outlining his ideas for how to transform algeria from an occupied tributary state to a colonial regime wherein he advocated for a mixed system of total domination and total colonization whereby french military would wage total war against civilian populations while a colonial administration would provide rule of law and property rights to settlers within french occupied cities from 1848 until independence france administered the whole mediterranean region of algeria as an integral part and département of the nation one of frances longestheld overseas territories algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of european immigrants who became known as colons and later as piednoirs between 1825 and 1847 50000 french people emigrated to algeria these settlers benefited from the french governments confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land many europeans settled in oran and algiers and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities during the late 19th and early 20th century the european share was almost a fifth of the population the french government aimed at making algeria an assimilated part of france and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900 the indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency but in contrast to the other colonized countries path in central asia and caucasus algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively humancapital intensive agriculture during the second world war algeria came under vichy control before being liberated by the allies in operation torch which saw the first largescale deployment of american troops in the north african campaign gradually dissatisfaction among the muslim population which lacked political and economic status under the colonial system gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from france in may 1945 the uprising against the occupying french forces was suppressed through what is now known as the sétif and guelma massacre tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954 when the first violent events of what was later called the algerian war began after the publication of the declaration of 1 november 1954 historians have estimated that between 30000 and 150000 harkis and their dependents were killed by the national liberation front fln or by lynch mobs in algeria the fln used hit and run attacks in algeria and france as part of its war and the french conducted severe reprisals in addition the french destroyed over 8000 villages and relocated over 2 million algerians to concentration camps the war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries historians like alistair horne and raymond aron state that the actual number of algerian muslim war dead was far greater than the original fln and official french estimates but was less than the 1 million deaths claimed by the algerian government after independence horne estimated algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around 700000 the war uprooted more than 2 million algerians the war against french rule concluded in 1962 when algeria gained complete independence following the march 1962 evian agreements and the july 1962 selfdetermination referendum the first three decades of independence 19621991 the number of european piednoirs who fled algeria totaled more than 900000 between 1962 and 1964 the exodus to mainland france accelerated after the oran massacre of 1962 in which hundreds of militants entered european sections of the city and began attacking civilians algerias first president was the front de libération nationale fln leader ahmed ben bella moroccos claim to portions of western algeria led to the sand war in 1963 ben bella was overthrown in 1965 by houari boumédiène his former ally and defence minister under ben bella the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian boumédienne continued this trend however he relied much more on the army for his support and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role he collectivised agriculture and launched a massive industrialisation drive oil extraction facilities were nationalised this was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international 1973 oil crisis boumédiennes successor chadli bendjedid introduced some liberal economic reforms he promoted a policy of arabisation in algerian society and public life teachers of arabic brought in from other muslim countries spread conventional islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to orthodox islam the algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the 1980s oil glut economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in algerian social unrest during the 1980s by the end of the decade bendjedid introduced a multiparty system political parties developed such as the islamic salvation front fis a broad coalition of muslim groups civil war 19912002 and aftermath in december 1991 the islamic salvation front dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections fearing the election of an islamist government the authorities intervened on 11 january 1992 cancelling the elections bendjedid resigned and a high council of state was installed to act as the presidency it banned the fis triggering a civil insurgency between the fronts armed wing the armed islamic group and the national armed forces in which more than 100000 people are thought to have died the islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacresnovember 2023 at several points in the conflict

group declared a ceasefire in october 1997 algeria held elections in 1999 considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by president abdelaziz bouteflika he worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a civil concord initiative approved in a referendum under which many political prisoners were pardoned and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty in force until 13 january 2000 the ais disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly the groupe salafiste pour la prédication et le combat gspc a splinter group of the armed islamic group continued a terrorist campaign against the government bouteflika was reelected in the april 2004 presidential election

guerrillas and government security forces in november 2008 the algerian constitution was amended following a vote in parliament removing the twoterm limit on presidential incumbents this change

the programme of national reconciliation and a 150billion spending programme to create three million new jobs the construction of one million new housing units and to continue public sector and

anthropology categories anthropology behavioural sciences humans anthropology is the scientific study of humanity concerned with human behavior human biology cultures societies and linguistics in both the present and past including past human species social anthropology studies patterns of behavior while cultural anthropology studies cultural meaning including norms and values a portmanteau term sociocultural anthropology is commonly used today linguistic anthropology studies how language influences social life biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans archaeological anthropology often termed as anthropology of the past studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence it is considered a branch of anthropology in north america and asia while in europe archaeology is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines such as history and palaeontology etymology the abstract noun anthropology is first attested in reference to history its present use first appeared in renaissance germany in the works of magnus hundt and otto casmann their neolatin anthropologia derived from the combining forms of the greek words ánthrōpos ἄνθρωπος human and lógos λόγος study its adjectival form appeared in the works of aristotle it began to be used in english possibly via french anthropologie by the early 18th century origin and development of the term through the 19th century in 1647 the bartholins early scholars of the university of copenhagen defined lanthropologie as follows sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently such as the use by étienne serres in 1839 to describe the natural history or paleontology of man based on comparative anatomy and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the french national museum of natural history by jean louis armand de quatrefages de bréau various shortlived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed the société ethnologique de paris the first to use the term ethnology was formed in 1839 and focused on methodically studying human races after the death of its founder william frédéric edwards in 1842 it gradually declined in activity until it eventually dissolved in 1862 meanwhile the ethnological society of new york currently the american ethnological society was founded on its model in 1842 as well as the ethnological society of london in 1843 a breakaway group of the aborigines protection society these anthropologists of the times were liberal antislavery and prohumanrights activists they maintained international connectionsseptember 2021 anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century theorists in diverse fields such as anatomy linguistics and ethnology started making featurebyfeature comparisons of their subject matters and were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals languages and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then for them the publication of charles darwins on the origin of species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in agronomy and in the wild darwin and wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences paul broca in paris was in the process of breaking away from the société de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies the société danthropologie de paris meeting for the first time in paris in 1859 when he read darwin he became an immediate convert to transformisme as the french called evolutionism his definition now became the study of the human group considered as a whole in its details and in relation to the rest of nature broca being what today would be called a neurosurgeon had taken an interest in the pathology of speech he wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals which appeared to reside in speech he discovered the speech center of the human brain today called brocas area after him his interest was mainly in biological anthropology but a german philosopher specializing in psychology theodor waitz took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his sixvolume work entitled die anthropologie der naturvölker 18591864 the title was soon translated as the anthropology of primitive peoples the last two volumes were published posthumously waitz defined anthropology as the science of the nature of man following brocas lead waitz points out that anthropology is a new field which would gather material from other fields but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy physiology and psychology to differentiate man from the animals nearest to him he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical gathered by experimentation the history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison it is to be presumed fundamentally that the species man is a unity and that the same laws of thought are applicable to all men waitz was influential among british ethnologists in 1863 the explorer richard francis burton and the speech therapist james hunt broke away from the ethnological society of london to form the anthropological society of london which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology it was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence representatives from the french société were present though not broca in his keynote address printed in the first volume of its new publication the anthropological review hunt stressed the work of waitz adopting his definitions as a standard among the first associates were the young edward burnett tylor inventor of cultural anthropology and his brother alfred tylor a geologist previously edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist subsequently an anthropologist similar organizations in other countries followed the anthropological society of madrid 1865 the american anthropological association in 1902 the anthropological society of vienna 1870 the italian society of anthropology and ethnology 1871 and many others subsequently the majority of these were evolutionists one notable exception was the berlin society for anthropology ethnology and prehistory 1869 founded by rudolph virchow known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists not religious himself he insisted that darwins conclusions lacked empirical foundation during the last three decades of the 19th century a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred most independent most publishing their own journals and all international in membership and association the major theorists belonged to these organizations they supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning by 1898 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology none of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology 20th and 21st centuries anthropology as a specialized field of academic study developed much through the end of the 19th century then it rapidly expanded beginning in the early 20th century to the point where many of the worlds higher educational institutions typically included anthropology departments thousands of anthropology departments have come into existence and anthropology has also diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more practical anthropology the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems has arrived for example the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene the organization has also reached a global level for example the world council of anthropological associations wcaa a network of national regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology currently contains members from about three dozen nations since the work of franz boas and bronisław malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries social anthropology in great britain and cultural anthropology in the us have been distinguished from other social sciences by their emphasis on crosscultural comparisons longterm indepth examination of context and the importance they place on participantobservation or experiential immersion in the area of research cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism holism and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques this has been particularly prominent in the united states from boas arguments against 19thcentury racial ideology through margaret meads advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation to current criticisms of postcolonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork in great britain and the commonwealth countries the british tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate in the united states anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by franz boas in the early 20th century biological or physical anthropology social cultural or sociocultural anthropology archaeological anthropology and linguistic anthropology these fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques european countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology a term coined and defined by adam f kollár in 1783 it is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the european tradition fields anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities social sciences and natural sciences anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of homo sapiens human physical traits human behavior the variations among different groups of humans how the evolutionary past of homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture and from social sciences including the organization of human social and cultural relations institutions social conflicts etc early anthropology originated in classical greece and persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity such as by albiruni of the islamic golden age as such anthropology has been central in the development of several new late 20th century interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science global studies and various ethnic studies according to clifford geertz sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies during the 1970s and 1990s there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the disciplinenovember 2023 during this shift enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology in contrast archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist due to this difference in epistemology the four subfields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decadesseptember 2022 sociocultural sociocultural anthropology draws together the principal axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among individuals and groups cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy literature and the arts how ones culture affects the experience for self and group contributing to a more complete understanding of the peoples knowledge customs and institutions while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history in that it helps develop an understanding of social structures typically of others and other populations such as minorities subgroups dissidents etc there is no hardandfast distinction between them and these categories overlap to a considerable degree inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in crosscultural comparison this project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research ie an ethnographic monograph as a methodology ethnography is based upon longterm fieldwork within a community or other research site participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures the process of participantobservation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic conceptual vs etic or technical point of view the study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology as kinship is a human universal sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization law and conflict resolution patterns of consumption and exchange material culture technology infrastructure gender relations ethnicity childrearing and socialization religion myth symbols values etiquette worldview sports music nutrition recreation games food festivals and language which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropologyseptember 2022 comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology including the industrialized and deindustrialized west the standard crosscultural sample sccs includes 186 such cultures biological biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and nonhuman primates in their biological evolutionary and demographic dimensions it examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates and that generate maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation archaeological archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains artifacts faunal remains and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies archaeologists examine material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups who are presumed to have lived in similar ways linguistic linguistic anthropology not to be confused with anthropological linguistics seeks to understand the processes of human communications verbal and nonverbal variation in language across time and space the social uses of language and the relationship between language and culture it is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics pragmatics cognitive linguistics semiotics discourse analysis and narrative analysis ethnography ethnography is a method of analysing social or cultural interaction it often involves participant observation though an ethnographer may also draw from texts written by participants of in social interactions ethnography views firsthand experience and social context as important tim ingold distinguishes ethnography from anthropology arguing that anthropology tries to construct general theories of human experience applicable in general and novel settings while ethnography concerns itself with fidelity he argues that the anthropologist must make his writing consistent with their understanding of literature and other theory but notes that ethnography may be of use to the anthropologists and the fields inform one another key topics by field sociocultural art media music dance and film art one of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of art as a cultural phenomenon several anthropologists have noted that the western categories of painting sculpture or literature conceived as independent artistic activities do not exist or exist in a significantly different form in most nonwestern contexts to surmount this difficulty anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which without exclusively being artistic have certain evident aesthetic qualities boas primitive art claude lévistrauss the way of the masks 1982 or geertzs art as cultural system 1983 are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of art into an anthropology of culturally specific aestheticsseptember 2022 media media anthropology also known as the anthropology of media or mass media emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers audiences and other cultural and social aspects of mass media the types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production eg ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers journalists in the field film production to contexts of media reception following audiences in their everyday responses to media other types include cyber anthropology a relatively new area of internet research as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media such as development work social movements or health education this is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts where media such as radio the press new media and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s music ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music broadly defined that emphasize its cultural social material cognitive biological and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire ethnomusicology can be used in a wide variety of fields such as teaching politics cultural anthropology etc while the origins of ethnomusicology date back to the 18th and 19th centuries it was formally termed ethnomusicology by dutch scholar jaap kunst 1950 later the influence of study in this area spawned the creation of the periodical ethnomusicology and the society of ethnomusicology visual visual anthropology is concerned in part with the study and production of ethnographic photography film and since the mid1990s new media while the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation including areas such as performance museums art and the production and reception of mass media visual representations from all cultures such as sandpaintings tattoos sculptures and reliefs cave paintings scrimshaw jewelry hieroglyphs paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology economic political economic applied and development economic economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic geographic and cultural scope it has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics of which it is highly critical its origins as a subfield of anthropology begin with the polishbritish founder of anthropology bronisław malinowski and his french compatriot marcel mauss on the nature of giftgiving exchange or reciprocity as an alternative to market exchange economic anthropology remains for the most part focused upon exchange the school of thought derived from marx and known as political economy focuses on production in contrast economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists and have now turned to examine corporations banks and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective political economy political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology including but not limited to noncapitalist societies political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture three main areas of interest rapidly developed the first of these areas was concerned with the precapitalist societies that were subject to evolutionary tribal stereotypes sahlins work on huntergatherers as the original affluent society did much to dissipate that image the second area was concerned with the vast majority of the worlds population at the time the peasantry many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in vietnam the third area was on colonialism imperialism and the creation of the capitalist worldsystem more recently these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial and postindustrial capitalism around the world applied applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems it is a complex of related researchbased instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data initiation of direct action andor the formulation of policy applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community it is closely related to development anthropology distinct from the more critical anthropology of developmentseptember 2022 development anthropology of development tends to view development from a critical perspective the kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach involve pondering why if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty is poverty increasing why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis in short why does so much planned development fail kinship feminism gender and sexuality kinship kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves over its history anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms such as descent descent groups lineages affines cognates and even fictive kinship broadly kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent ones social relations during development and also relatives by marriage within kinship you have two different families people have their biological families and it is the people they share dna with this is called consanguinity or blood tiesnovember 2023 people can also have a chosen family in which they chose who they want to be a part of their family in some cases people are closer with their chosen family more than with their biological families feminist feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology archeological biological cultural linguistic that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings anthropological hiring practices and the scholarly production of knowledge anthropology engages often with feminists from nonwestern traditions whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white feminists of europe america and elsewhere from the perspective of the western world historically such peripheral perspectives have been ignored observed only from an outsider perspective and regarded as lessvalid or lessimportant than knowledge from the western worldreliable source needed for the whole sentence exploring and addressing that double bias against women from marginalized racial or ethnic groups is of particular interest in intersectional feminist anthropology feminist anthropologists have stated that their publications have contributed to anthropology along the way correcting against the systemic biases beginning with the patriarchal origins of anthropology and academia and note that from 1891 to 1930 doctorates in anthropology went to males more than 85 more than 81 were under 35 and only 72 to anyone over 40 years old thus reflecting an age gap in the pursuit of anthropology by firstwave feminists until later in life this correction of systemic bias may include mainstream feminist theory history linguistics archaeology and anthropology feminist anthropologists are often concerned with the construction of gender across societies gender constructs are of particular interest when studying sexismseptember 2022 according to st clair drake vera mae green was until well into the 1960s the only african american female anthropologist who was also a caribbeanist she studied ethnic and family relations in the caribbean as well as the united states and thereby tried to improve the way black life experiences and culture were studied however zora neale hurston although often primarily considered to be a literary author was trained in anthropology by franz boas and published tell my horse about her anthropological observations of voodoo in the caribbean 1938 feminist anthropology is inclusive of the anthropology of birth as a specialization which is the anthropological study of pregnancy and childbirth within cultures and societies medical nutritional psychological cognitive and transpersonal medical medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies human health and disease health care systems and biocultural adaptation it is believed that william caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology currently research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole it focuses on the following six basic fields other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering farmer 1999 2003 beneduce 2010 as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness on the other hand there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or ethnopsychiatry nutritional nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems nutritional status and food security and how changes in the former affect the latter if economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food food security and dietary health then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization nutritional status affects overall health status work performance potential and the overall potential for economic development either in terms of human development or traditional western models for any given group of people psychological psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes this subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans development and enculturation within a particular cultural group  with its own history language practices and conceptual categories  shape processes of human cognition emotion perception motivation and mental health it also examines how the understanding of cognition emotion motivation and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes cognitive cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge cultural innovation and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology often through close collaboration with historians ethnographers archaeologists linguists musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them transpersonal transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture as with transpersonal psychology the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness asc and transpersonal experience however the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of crosscultural issues  for instance the roles of myth ritual diet and text in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences political and legal political political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems looked at from the basis of the structure of societies political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies a new development started from the 1960s and is still unfolding anthropologists started increasingly to study more complex social settings in which the presence of states bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena the turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels firstly anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the stateregulated sphere as in patronclient relations or tribal political organization secondly anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions an anthropology of the state developed and it is a most thriving field today geertzs comparative work on negara the balinese state is an early famous example legal legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in the crosscultural study of social ordering earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management crime sanctions or formal regulation more recent applications include issues such as human rights legal pluralism and political uprisings public public anthropology was created by robert borofsky a professor at hawaii pacific university to demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline  illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change nature science and technology cyborg cyborg anthropology originated as a subfocus group within the american anthropological associations annual meeting in 1993 the subgroup was very closely related to sts and the society for the social studies of science donna haraways 1985 cyborg manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beingsseptember 2022 digital digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digitalera technology and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect it is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology and sometimes considered part of material culture the field is new and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases these include technoanthropology digital ethnography cyberanthropology and virtual anthropology ecological ecological anthropology is defined as the study of cultural adaptations to environments the subfield is also defined as the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment the focus of its research concerns how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments and how their environments change across space and time the contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology and arguably at least the backdrop if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today is political ecology many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture politics and power globalization localized issues century anthropology and more the focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments foragainst or creation of policy and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land often the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly organizing participation or indirectly articles documentaries books ethnographies such is the case with environmental justice advocate melissa checker and her relationship with the people of hyde park environment social sciences like anthropology can provide interdisciplinary approaches to the environment professor kay milton director of the anthropology research network in the school of history and anthropology describes anthropology as distinctive with its most distinguishing feature being its interest in nonindustrial indigenous and traditional societies anthropological theory is distinct because of the consistent presence of the concept of culture not an exclusive topic but a central position in the study and a deep concern with the human condition milton describes three trends that are causing a fundamental shift in what characterizes anthropology dissatisfaction with the cultural relativist perspective reaction against cartesian dualisms which obstructs progress in theory nature culture divide and finally an increased attention to globalization transcending the barriers or timespace environmental discourse appears to be characterized by a high degree of globalization the troubling problem is borrowing nonindigenous practices and creating standards concepts philosophies and practices in western countries anthropology and environmental discourse now have become a distinct position in anthropology as a discipline knowledge about diversities in human culture can be important in addressing environmental problems  anthropology is now a study of human ecology human activity is the most important agent in creating environmental change a study commonly found in human ecology which can claim a central place in how environmental problems are examined and addressed other ways anthropology contributes to environmental discourse is by being theorists and analysts or by refinement of definitions to become more neutraluniversal etc in exploring environmentalism  the term typically refers to a concern that the environment should be protected particularly from the harmful effects of human activities environmentalism itself can be expressed in many ways anthropologists can open the doors of environmentalism by looking beyond industrial society understanding the opposition between industrial and nonindustrial relationships knowing what ecosystem people and biosphere people are and are affected by dependent and independent variables primitive ecological wisdom diverse environments resource management diverse cultural traditions and knowing that environmentalism is a part of culture historical ethnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures and indigenous customs by examining historical records it is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not exist today ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps music paintings photography folklore oral tradition site exploration archaeological materials museum collections enduring customs language and place names religion the anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion and that every religion is a cultural product created by the human community that worships it urban urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization poverty and neoliberalism ulf hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were a notoriously agoraphobic lot antiurban by definition various social processes in the western world as well as in the third world the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists brought the attention of specialists in other cultures closer to their homes there are two main approaches to urban anthropology examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities these two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other by defining different types of cities one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities by directly looking at the different social issues one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city key topics by field archaeological and biological anthrozoology anthrozoology also known as humananimal studies is the study of interaction between living things it is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines including anthropology ethology medicine psychology veterinary medicine and zoology a major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of humananimal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions it includes scholars from a diverse range of fields including anthropology sociology biology and philosophy biocultural biocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective that is from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences after world war ii the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology evolutionary evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and nonhominin primates evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science combining the human development with socioeconomic factors evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans past and present it is based on a scientific approach and brings together fields such as archaeology behavioral ecology psychology primatology and genetics it is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience past and present forensic forensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in a legal setting most often in criminal cases where the victims remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition a forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed burned mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable the adjective forensic refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law palaeoanthropology paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology it is the study of ancient humans as found in fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints genetics and morphology of specimens are crucially important to this field markers on specimens such as enamel fractures and dental decay on teeth can also give insight into the behaviour and diet of past populations organizations contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges the single largest organization of anthropologists is the american anthropological association aaa which was founded in 1903 its members are anthropologists from around the globe in 1989 a group of european and american scholars in the field of anthropology established the european association of social anthropologists easa which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in europe the easa seeks to advance the status of anthropology in europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology hundreds of other organizations exist in the various subfields of anthropology sometimes divided up by nation or region and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines such as geology physics zoology paleontology anatomy music theory art history sociology and so on belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well list of major organizations ethics as the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves and professional societies have generated codes of ethics anthropologists like other researchers especially historians and scientists engaged in field research have over time assisted state policies and projects especially colonialism some commentators have contended cultural relativism as part of their quest for scientific objectivity presentday anthropologists typically urge cultural relativism which has an influence on all the subfields of anthropology this is the notion that cultures should not be judged by anothers values or viewpoints but be examined dispassionately on their own terms there should be no notions in good anthropology of one culture being better or worse than another cultureoctober 2012 ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide infanticide racism sexism mutilation including circumcision and subincision and torture topics like racism slavery and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies to genes to acculturation to colonialism have been proposed to explain their origins and continued recurrences to illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach one can take just one of these topics such as racism and find thousands of anthropological references stretching across all the major and minor subfields military involvement anthropologists involvement with the us government in particular has caused bitter controversy within the discipline franz boas publicly objected to us participation in world war i and after the war he published a brief exposé and condemnation of the participation of several american archaeologists in espionage in mexico under their cover as scientists but by the 1940s many of boas anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the axis powers nazi germany fascist italy and imperial japan many served in the armed forces while others worked in intelligence for example office of strategic services and the office of war information at the same time david h prices work on american anthropology during the cold war provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the cia and government intelligence activities during the vietnam war years have turned up little many anthropologists students and teachers were active in the antiwar movement numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the american anthropological association aaa professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings the association of social anthropologists of the uk and commonwealth asa has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous the principles of professional responsibility issued by the american anthropological association and amended through november 1986 stated that in relation with their own government and with host governments  no secret research no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given the current principles of professional responsibility does not make explicit mention of ethics surrounding state interactions anthropologists along with other social scientists are working with the us military as part of the us armys strategy in afghanistan the christian science monitor reports that counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs in afghanistan under the human terrain system hts program in addition hts teams are working with the us military in iraq in 2009 the american anthropological associations commission on the engagement of anthropology with the us security and intelligence communities ceaussic released its final report concluding in part that when ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions not subject to external review where data collection occurs in the context of war integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency and in a potentially coercive environment  all characteristic factors of the hts concept and its application  it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology in summary while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible ceaussic suggests that the aaa emphasize the incompatibility of hts with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing hts to define the meaning of anthropology within dod postworld war ii developments before wwii british social anthropology and american cultural anthropology were still distinct traditions after the war enough british and american anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as sociocultural anthropology basic trends there are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work one of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical the quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place problem or phenomenon in detail using a variety of methods over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia in the 1990s and 2000s calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard these dynamic relationships between what can be observed on the ground as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology whether cultural biological linguistic or archaeological biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals behaviors ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures they use many different methods of study but modern population genetics participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists into the field which means traveling to a community in its own setting to do something called fieldwork on the biological or physical side human measurements genetic samples nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions human time on earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material such as the paleolithic and the neolithic of particular use in archaeologynovember 2012 further cultural subdivisions according to tool types such as olduwan or mousterian or levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human pastnovember 2012 anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well since mapping cultures is central to both sciences by making comparisons across cultural traditions timebased and cultural regions spacebased anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method a central part of their science commonalities between fields because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises see history of anthropology including but not limited to fossilhunting exploring documentary filmmaking paleontology primatology antiquity dealings and curatorship philology etymology genetics regional analysis ethnology history philosophy and religious studies it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of other cultures both in terms of time past societies and space noneuropeannonwestern societies for example the classic of urban anthropology ulf hannerz in the introduction to his seminal exploring the city inquiries toward an urban anthropology mentions that the third world had habitually received most of attention anthropologists who traditionally specialized in other cultures looked for them far away and started to look across the tracks only in late 1960s now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the authors home it is also argued that other fields of study like history and sociology on the contrary focus disproportionately on the west in france the study of western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists but this is increasingly changing starting in the 1970s from scholars like isac chiva and journals like terrain fieldwork and developing with the center founded by marc augé le centre danthropologie des mondes contemporains the anthropological research center of contemporary societies since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the north atlantic region frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale there has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people increasingly research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories social movements governmental and

alchemy esotericism hermeticism natural philosophy history of science alchemy from arabic alkīmiyā from ancient greek χυμεία khumeía is an ancient branch of natural philosophy a philosophical and protoscientific tradition that was historically practised in china india the muslim world and europe in its western form alchemy is first attested in a number of pseudepigraphical texts written in grecoroman egypt during the first few centuries ad alchemists attempted to purify mature and perfect certain materials common aims were chrysopoeia the transmutation of base metals eg lead into noble metals particularly gold the creation of an elixir of immortality and the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease the perfection of the human body and soul was thought to result from the alchemical magnum opus great work the concept of creating the philosophers stone was variously connected with all of these projects islamic and european alchemists developed a basic set of laboratory techniques theories and terms some of which are still in use today they did not abandon the ancient greek philosophical idea that everything is composed of four elements and they tended to guard their work in secrecy often making use of cyphers and cryptic symbolism in europe the 12thcentury translations of medieval islamic works on science and the rediscovery of aristotelian philosophy gave birth to a flourishing tradition of latin alchemy this late medieval tradition of alchemy would go on to play a significant role in the development of early modern science particularly chemistry and medicine modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects despite criticisms by scholars such as eric j holmyard and marielouise von franz that they should be understood as complementary the former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry medicine and charlatanism and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred the latter interests historians of esotericism psychologists and some philosophers and spiritualists the subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts etymology the word alchemy comes from old french alquemie alkimie used in medieval latin as alchymia this name was itself adopted from the arabic word ar الكيمياء the arabic ar in turn was a borrowing of the late greek term khēmeía χημεία also spelled khumeia χυμεία and khēmía χημία with al being the arabic definite article the together this association can be interpreted as the process of transmutation by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form several etymologies have been proposed for the greek term the first was proposed by zosimos of panopolis 3rd4th centuries who derived it from the name of a book the khemeu hermann diels argued in 1914 that it rather derived from χύμα used to describe metallic objects formed by casting others trace its roots to the egyptian name kēme hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖 khmi  meaning black earth which refers to the fertile and auriferous soil of the nile valley as opposed to red desert sand according to the egyptologist wallis budge the arabic word alkīmiyaʾ actually means the egyptian science borrowing from the coptic word for egypt kēme or its equivalent in the mediaeval bohairic dialect of coptic khēme this coptic word derives from demotic kmỉ itself from ancient egyptian kmt the ancient egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour black egypt was the black land by contrast with the red land the surrounding desert history alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents these traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships one can distinguish at least three major strands which appear to be mostly independent at least in their earlier stages chinese alchemy centered in china indian alchemy centered on the indian subcontinent and western alchemy which occurred around the mediterranean and whose center shifted over the millennia from grecoroman egypt to the islamic world and finally medieval europe chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism and indian alchemy with the dharmic faiths in contrast western alchemy developed its philosophical system mostly independent of but influenced by various western religions it is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin or to what extent they influenced each other hellenistic egypt the start of western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and hellenistic egypt where the city of alexandria was a center of alchemical knowledge and retained its preeminence through most of the greek and roman periods following the work of andréjean festugière modern scholars see alchemical practice in the roman empire as originating from the egyptian goldsmiths art greek philosophy and different religious traditions tracing the origins of the alchemical art in egypt is complicated by the pseudepigraphic nature of texts from the greek alchemical corpus the treatises of zosimos of panopolis the earliest historically attested author fl c 300 ad can help in situating the other authors zosimus based his work on that of older alchemical authors such as mary the jewess pseudodemocritus and agathodaimon but very little is known about any of these authors the most complete of their works the four books of pseudodemocritus were probably written in the first century ad recent scholarship tends to emphasize the testimony of zosimus who traced the alchemical arts back to egyptian metallurgical and ceremonial practices it has also been argued that early alchemical writers borrowed the vocabulary of greek philosophical schools but did not implement any of its doctrines in a systematic way zosimos of panopolis wrote in the final abstinence also known as the final count zosimos explains that the ancient practice of tinctures the technical greek name for the alchemical arts had been taken over by certain demons who taught the art only to those who offered them sacrifices since zosimos also called the demons the guardians of places οἱ κατὰ τόπον ἔφοροι el and those who offered them sacrifices priests ἱερέα el it is fairly clear that he was referring to the gods of egypt and their priests while critical of the kind of alchemy he associated with the egyptian priests and their followers zosimos nonetheless saw the traditions recent past as rooted in the rites of the egyptian temples mythology  zosimos of panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to pharaonic egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class though there is little to no evidence for his assertion alchemical writers used classical figures from greek roman and egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation these included the pantheon of gods related to the classical planets isis osiris jason and many others the central figure in the mythology of alchemy is hermes trismegistus or thricegreat hermes his name is derived from the god thoth and his greek counterpart hermes hermes and his caduceus or serpentstaff were among alchemys principal symbols according to clement of alexandria he wrote what were called the fortytwo books of hermes covering all fields of knowledge the hermetica of thricegreat hermes is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners these writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era technology  the dawn of western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy extending back to 3500 bc many writings were lost when the roman emperor diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in alexandria ad 292 few original egyptian documents on alchemy have survived most notable among them the stockholm papyrus and the leyden papyrus x dating from ad 250300 they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones cleaning and fabricating pearls and manufacturing of imitation gold and silvermay 2019 these writings lack the mystical philosophical elements of alchemy but do contain the works of bolus of mendes or pseudodemocritus which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements between the time of bolus and zosimos the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a hermetic art philosophy  alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of pythagoreanism platonism stoicism and gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemys character an important example of alchemys roots in greek philosophy originated by empedocles and developed by aristotle was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth air water and fire according to aristotle each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed the four elements of the greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter not quantitative as our modern elements are true alchemy never regarded earth air water and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the presentday sense of the word the four elements are simply the primary and most general qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept alchemy coexisted alongside emerging christianity lactantius believed hermes trismegistus had prophesied its birth st augustine later affirmed this in the 4th  5th centuries but also condemned trismegistus for idolatry examples of pagan christian and jewish alchemists can be found during this period most of the grecoroman alchemists preceding zosimos are known only by pseudonyms such as moses isis cleopatra democritus and ostanes others authors such as komarios and chymes we only know through fragments of text after ad 400 greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors by the middle of the 7th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline it was at that time that khalid ibn yazid sparked its migration from alexandria to the islamic world facilitating the translation and preservation of greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries byzantium greek alchemy was preserved in medieval byzantine manuscripts after the fall of egypt and yet historians have only relatively recently begun to pay attention to the study and development of greek alchemy in the byzantine period india the 2nd millennium bc text vedas describe a connection between eternal life and gold a considerable knowledge of metallurgy has been exhibited in a thirdcentury ad text called arthashastra which provides ingredients of explosives agniyoga and salts extracted from fertile soils and plant remains yavakshara such as saltpetrenitre perfume making different qualities of perfumes are mentioned granulated refined sugar buddhist texts from the 2nd to 5th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold according to some scholars greek alchemy may have influenced indian alchemy but there are no hard evidences to back this claim the 11thcentury persian chemist and physician abū rayhān bīrūnī who visited gujarat as part of the court of mahmud of ghazni reported that they the goals of alchemy in india included the creation of a divine body sanskrit divyadeham and immortality while still embodied sanskrit jīvanmukti sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur that are homologized with the semen of the god śiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess devī some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of matsyendranath other early writings are found in the jaina medical treatise kalyāṇakārakam of ugrāditya written in south india in the early 9th century two famous early indian alchemical authors were nāgārjuna siddha and nityanātha siddha nāgārjuna siddha was a buddhist monk his book rasendramangalam is an example of indian alchemy and medicine nityanātha siddha wrote rasaratnākara also a highly influential work in sanskrit rasa translates to mercury and nāgārjuna siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold scholarship on indian alchemy is in the publication of the alchemical body by david gordon white a modern bibliography on indian alchemical studies has been written by white the contents of 39 sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in g jan meulenbelds history of indian medical literature the discussion of these works in himl gives a summary of the contents of each work their special features and where possible the evidence concerning their dating chapter 13 of himl various works on rasaśāstra and ratnaśāstra or various works on alchemy and gems gives brief details of a further 655 six hundred and fiftyfive treatises in some cases meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles a great deal remains to be discovered about indian alchemical literature the content of the sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet 2014 been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy islamic world after the fall of the roman empire the focus of alchemical development moved to the islamic world much more is known about islamic alchemy because it was better documented indeed most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as arabic translations the word alchemy itself was derived from the arabic word alkīmiyā الكيمياء the early islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy platonic and aristotelian thought which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through syriac translations and scholarship in the late ninth and early tenth centuries the arabic works attributed to jābir ibn hayyān latinized as geber or geberus introduced a new approach to alchemy paul kraus who wrote the standard reference work on jabir put it as follows islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism the most influential author in this regard was arguably jabir jabirs ultimate goal was takwin the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory up to and including human life he analysed each aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness coldness dryness and moistness according to jabir in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior for example lead was externally cold and dry while gold was hot and moist thus jabir theorized by rearranging the qualities of one metal a different metal would result by this reasoning the search for the philosophers stone was introduced to western alchemy jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substances name in arabic when treated with various transformations held correspondences to the elements physical properties the elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with jabir his original system consisted of seven elements which included the five classical elements aether air earth fire and water in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals sulphur the stone which burns which characterized the principle of combustibility and mercury which contained the idealized principle of metallic propertiesjanuary 2021january 2021 shortly thereafter this evolved into eight elements with the arabic concept of the three metallic principles sulphur giving flammability or combustion mercury giving volatility and stability and salt giving solidityjanuary 2021january 2021january 2021 the atomic theory of corpuscularianism where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles also has its origins in the work of jabir from the 9th to 14th centuries alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical muslim chemists including alkindus abū alrayhān albīrūnī avicenna and ibn khaldun in particular they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals from the 14th century onwards many materials and practices originally belonging to indian alchemy rasayana were assimilated in the persian texts written by muslim scholars east asia researchers have found evidence that chinese alchemists and philosophers discovered complex mathematical phenomena that were shared with arab alchemists during the medieval period discovered in bc china the magic square of three was propagated to followers of abū mūsā jābir ibn ḥayyān at some point over the proceeding several hundred years other commonalities shared between the two alchemical schools of thought include discrete naming for ingredients and heavy influence from the natural elements the silk road provided a clear path for the exchange of goods ideas ingredients religion and many other aspects of life with which alchemy is intertwined whereas european alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine the philosophers stone of european alchemists can be compared to the grand elixir of immortality sought by chinese alchemists in the hermetic view these two goals were not unconnected and the philosophers stone was often equated with the universal panacea therefore the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears as early as 317 ad ge hong documented the use of metals minerals and elixirs in early chinese medicine hong identified three ancient chinese documents titled scripture of great clarity scripture of the nine elixirs and scripture of the golden liquor as texts containing fundamental alchemical information he also described alchemy along with meditation as the sole spiritual practices that could allow one to gain immortality or to transcend in his work inner chapters of the book of the master who embraces spontaneous nature 317 ad hong argued that alchemical solutions such as elixirs were preferable to traditional medicinal treatment due to the spiritual protection they could provide in the centuries following ge hongs death the emphasis placed on alchemy as a spiritual practice among chinese daoists was reduced in 499 ad tao hongjing refuted hongs statement that alchemy is as important a spiritual practice as shangqing meditation while hongjing did not deny the power of alchemical elixirs to grant immortality or provide divine protection he ultimately found the scripture of the nine elixirs to be ambiguous and spiritually unfulfilling aiming to implement more accessible practising techniques in the early 700s neidan also known as internal alchemy was adopted by daoists as a new form of alchemy neidan emphasized appeasing the inner gods that inhabit the human body by practising alchemy with compounds found in the body rather than the mixing of natural resources that was emphasized in early dao alchemy for example saliva was often considered nourishment for the inner gods and did not require any conscious alchemical reaction to produce the inner gods were not thought of as physical presences occupying each person but rather a collection of deities that are each said to represent and protect a specific body part or region although those who practised neidan prioritized meditation over external alchemical strategies many of the same elixirs and constituents from previous daoist alchemical schools of thought continued to be utilized in tandem with meditation eternal life remained a consideration for neidan alchemists as it was believed that one would become immortal if an inner god were to be immortalized within them through spiritual fulfilment black powder may have been an important invention of chinese alchemists it is said that the chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a potion for eternal life described in 9thcentury textsseptember 2015 and used in fireworks in china by the 10th centuryseptember 2015 it was used in cannons by 1290september 2015 from china the use of gunpowder spread to japan the mongols the muslim world and europe gunpowder was used by the mongols against the hungarians in 1241 and in europe by the 14th century chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoist forms of traditional chinese medicine such as acupuncture and moxibustion in the early song dynasty followers of this taoist idea chiefly the elite and upper class would ingest mercuric sulfide which though tolerable in low levels led many to suicideseptember 2015 thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the taoist heavens the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favour of external sourcesseptember 2015 the aforementioned tai chi chuanseptember 2015 mastering of the qiseptember 2015 etc chinese alchemy was introduced to the west by obed simon johnson medieval europe the introduction of alchemy to latin europe may be dated to 11 february 1144 with the completion of robert of chesters translation of the liber de compositione alchemiae book on the composition of alchemy from an arabic work attributed to khalid ibn yazid although european craftsmen and technicians preexisted robert notes in his preface that alchemy here still referring to the elixir rather than to the art itself was unknown in latin europe at the time of his writing the translation of arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12thcentury toledo spain through contributors like gerard of cremona and adelard of bath translations of the time included the turba philosophorum and the works of avicenna and muhammad ibn zakariya alrazi these brought with them many new words to the european vocabulary for which there was no previous latin equivalent alcohol carboy elixir and athanor are examples meanwhile theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism thereby priming europe for the influx of alchemical thought the 11thcentury st anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a christian context in the early 12th century peter abelard followed anselms work laying down the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle had reached the west in the early 13th century robert grosseteste used abelards methods of analysis and added the use of observation experimentation and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations grosseteste also did much work to reconcile platonic and aristotelian thinking through much of the 12th and 13th centuries alchemical knowledge in europe remained centered on translations and new latin contributions were not made the efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists in the 13th century albertus magnus and roger bacon were the most notable of these their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in aristotelian terms albertus magnus a dominican friar is known to have written works such as the book of minerals where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like hermes and democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time albertus critically compared these to the writings of aristotle and avicenna where they concerned the transmutation of metals from the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century more than 28 alchemical tracts were misattributed to him a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist likewise alchemical texts have been attributed to alberts student thomas aquinas roger bacon a franciscan friar who wrote on a wide variety of topics including optics comparative linguistics and medicine composed his great work opus majus for pope clement iv as part of a project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time while alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemys connections to soteriology and christian theology bacons writings integrated morality salvation alchemy and the prolongation of life his correspondence with clement highlighted this noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy like the greeks before him bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres he noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of aristotle the natural philosophers and all latin writers of his time the practical confirmed the theoretical and bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine in later european legend he became an archmage in particular along with albertus magnus he was credited with the forging of a brazen head capable of answering its owners questions soon after bacon the influential work of pseudogeber sometimes identified as paul of taranto appeared his summa perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods it was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphurmercury theory and the unusual clarity with which they were described by the end of the 13th century alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief adepts believed in the macrocosmmicrocosm theories of hermes that is to say they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body for example if one could learn the secret of purifying gold one could use the technique to purify the human soul they believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated finally the alchemists practised their art they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that mans soul was divided within himself after the fall of adam by purifying the two parts of mans soul man could be reunited with god in the 14th century alchemy became more accessible to europeans outside the confines of latin speaking churchmen and scholars alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves dante piers plowman and chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars pope john xxiis 1317 edict spondent quas nonexhibent forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudoalchemists roman catholic inquisitor general nicholas eymerichs directorium inquisitorum written in 1376 associated alchemy with the performance of demonic rituals which eymerich differentiated from magic performed in accordance with scripture this did not however lead to any change in the inquisitions monitoring or prosecution of alchemists in 1403 henry iv of england banned the practice of multiplying metals although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically and a number were granted by henry vi and edward iv these critiques and regulations centered more around pseudoalchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy which continued with an increasingly christian tone the 14th century saw the christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of petrus bonus john of rupescissa and in works written in the name of raymond lull and arnold of villanova nicolas flamel is a wellknown alchemist to the point where he had many pseudepigraphic imitators although the historical flamel existed the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612 flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosophers stone his work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him especially as regarded the philosophers stone through the 14th and 15th centuries alchemists were much like flamel they concentrated on looking for the philosophers stone bernard trevisan and george ripley made similar contributions their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art a common idea in european alchemy in the medieval era was a metaphysical homeric chain of wise men that linked heaven and earth that included ancient pagan philosophers and other important historical figures renaissance and early modern europe during the renaissance hermetic and platonic foundations were restored to european alchemy the dawn of medical pharmaceutical occult and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed in the late 15th century marsilio ficino translated the corpus hermeticum and the works of plato into latin these were previously unavailable to europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that bacon had declared absent renaissance humanism and renaissance neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult hermeticism fusing it with magic astrology and christian cabala a key figure in this development was german heinrich cornelius agrippa 14861535 who received his hermetic education in italy in the schools of the humanists in his de occulta philosophia he attempted to merge kabbalah hermeticism and alchemy he was instrumental in spreading this new blend of hermeticism outside the borders of italy paracelsus philippus aureolus theophrastus bombastus von hohenheim 14931541 cast alchemy into a new form rejecting some of agrippas occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote many have said of alchemy that it is for the making of gold and silver for me such is not the aim but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines his hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and nature the macrocosm he took an approach different from those before him using this analogy not in the manner of soulpurification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them iatrochemistry refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by paracelsus john dee 13 july 1527  december 1608 followed agrippas occult tradition although better known for angel summoning divination and his role as astrologer cryptographer and consultant to queen elizabeth i dees alchemical monas hieroglyphica written in 1564 was his most popular and influential work his writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the hermetic axiom as above so below during the 17th century a shortlived supernatural interpretation of alchemy became popular including support by fellows of the royal society robert boyle and elias ashmole proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosophers stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels entrepreneurial opportunities were common for the alchemists of renaissance europe alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining medical services and the production of chemicals medicines metals and gemstones rudolf ii holy roman emperor in the late 16th century famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in prague including dee and his associate edward kelley king james iv of scotland julius duke of brunswicklüneburg henry v duke of brunswicklüneburg augustus elector of saxony julius echter von mespelbrunn and maurice landgrave of hessekassel all contracted alchemists johns son arthur dee worked as a court physician to michael i of russia and charles i of england but also compiled the alchemical book fasciculus chemicus although most of these appointments were legitimate the trend of pseudoalchemical fraud continued through the renaissance betrüger would use sleight of hand or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as michael maier and heinrich khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations distinguishing themselves from the con artists false alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud the terms chemia and alchemia were used as synonyms in the early modern period and the differences between alchemy chemistry and smallscale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day there were important overlaps between practitioners and trying to classify them into alchemists chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic for example tycho brahe 15461601 an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations had a laboratory built at his uraniborg observatoryresearch institute michael sendivogius michał sędziwój 15661636 a polish alchemist philosopher medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around 1600 sendivogious taught his technique to cornelius drebbel who in 1621 applied this in a submarine isaac newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy see isaac newtons occult studies than he did to either optics or physics other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include robert boyle and jan baptist van helmont their hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science later modern period the decline of european alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for ancient wisdom although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years and in fact may have reached its peak in the 18th century as late as 1781 james price claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold early modern european alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories practices and purposes scholastic and antiaristotelian paracelsian and antiparacelsian hermetic neoplatonic mechanistic vitalistic and moreplus virtually every combination and compromise thereof robert boyle 16271691 pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations he assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out the wind characteristics the position of the sun and moon and the barometer reading all just in case they proved to be relevant this approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries based on revolutionary discoveries and ideas of lavoisier and john dalton beginning around 1720 a rigid distinction began to be drawn for the first time between alchemy and chemistry by the 1740s alchemy was now restricted to the realm of gold making leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud in order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure to which alchemy was being subjected academic writers during the 18thcentury scientific enlightenment attempted to divorce and separate the new chemistry from the old practices of alchemy this move was mostly successful and the consequences of this continued into the 19th 20th and 21st centuries during the occult revival of the early 19th century alchemy received new attention as an occult science the esoteric or occultist school that arose during the 19th century held the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense less than as a practical tradition or protoscience this interpretation claimed that the obscure language of the alchemical texts which 19th century practitioners were not always able to decipher were an allegorical guise for spiritual moral or mystical processes two seminal figures during this period were mary anne atwood and ethan allen hitchcock who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy both rebuffed the growing successes of chemistry developing a completely esoteric view of alchemy atwood wrote no modern art or chemistry notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims has any thing in common with alchemy atwoods work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including eliphas levi arthur edward waite and rudolf steiner hitchcock in his remarks upon alchymists 1855 attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state in 1845 baron carl reichenbach published his studies on odic force a concept with some similarities to alchemy but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion in 1946 louis cattiaux published the message retrouvé a work that was at once philosophical mystical and highly influenced by alchemy in his lineage many researchers including emmanuel and charles dhooghvorst are updating alchemical studies in france and belgium women several women appear in the earliest history of alchemy michael maier names four women who were able to make the philosophers stone mary the jewess cleopatra the alchemist medera and taphnutia zosimos sister theosebia later known as euthica the arab and isis the prophetess also played roles in early alchemical texts the first alchemist whose name we know was mary the jewess 200 ad early sources claim that mary or maria devised a number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry her best known advances were in heating and distillation processes the laboratory waterbath known eponymously especially in france as the bainmarie is said to have been invented or at least improved by her essentially a doubleboiler it was and is used in chemistry for processes that required gentle heating the tribikos a modified distillation apparatus and the kerotakis a more intricate apparatus used especially for sublimations are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her although we have no writing from mary herself she is known from the earlyfourthcentury writings of zosimos of panopolis after the grecoroman period womens names appear less frequently in alchemical literature towards the end of the middle ages and beginning of the renaissance due to the emergence of print women were able to access the alchemical knowledge from texts of the preceding centuries caterina sforza the countess of forlì and lady of imola is one of the few confirmed female alchemists after mary the jewess as she owned an apothecary she would practice science and conduct experiments in her botanic gardens and laboratories being knowledgeable in alchemy and pharmacology she recorded all of her alchemical ventures in a manuscript named experimenti experiments the manuscript contained more than four hundred recipes covering alchemy as well as cosmetics and medicine one of these recipes was for the water of talc talc which makes up talcum powder is a mineral which when combined with water and distilled was said to produce a solution which yielded many benefits these supposed benefits included turning silver to gold and rejuvenation when combined with white wine its powder form could be ingested to counteract poison furthermore if that powder was mixed and drunk with white wine it was said to be a source of protection from any poison sickness or plague other recipes were for making hair dyes lotions lip colours there was also information on how to treat a variety of ailments from fevers and coughs to epilepsy and cancer in addition there were instructions on producing the quintessence or aether an elixir which was believed to be able to heal all sicknesses defend against diseases and perpetuate youthfulness she also wrote about creating the illustrious philosophers stone some women known for their interest in alchemy were catherine de medici the queen of france and marie de medici the following queen of france who carried out experiments in her personal laboratory also isabella deste the marchioness of mantua made perfumes herself to serve as gifts due to the proliferation in alchemical literature of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works however it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women this contributed to a broader pattern in which male authors credited prominent noblewomen for beauty products with the purpose of appealing to a female audience for example in ricettario galante gallant recipebook the distillation of lemons and roses was attributed to elisabetta gonzaga the duchess of urbino in the same book isabella daragona the daughter of alfonso ii of naples is accredited for recipes involving alum and mercury ippolita maria sforza is even referred to in an anonymous manuscript about a hand lotion created with rose powder and crushed bones as the sixteenth century went on scientific culture flourished and people began collecting secrets during this period secrets referred to experiments and the most coveted ones were not those which were bizarre but the ones which had been proven to yield the desired outcome in this period the only book of secrets ascribed to a woman was i secreti della signora isabella cortese the secrets of signora isabella cortese this book contained information on how to turn base metals into gold medicine and cosmetics however it is rumoured that a man girolamo ruscelli was the real author and only used a female voice to attract female readers in the nineteenthcentury mary anne atwoods a suggestive inquiry into the hermetic mystery 1850 marked the return of women during the occult revival modern historical research the history of alchemy has become a recognized subject of academic study as the language of the alchemists is analysed historians are becoming more aware of the connections between that discipline and other facets of western cultural history such as the evolution of science and philosophy the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities kabbalism spiritualism rosicrucianism and other mystic movements institutions involved in this research include the chymistry of isaac newton project at indiana university the university of exeter centre for the study of esotericism exeseso the european society for the study of western esotericism esswe and the university of amsterdams subdepartment for the history of hermetic philosophy and related currents a large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the bibliotheca philosophica hermetica in amsterdam journals which publish regularly on the topic of alchemy include ambix published by the society for the history of alchemy and chemistry and isis published by the history of science society core concepts western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born concepts were imported from neoplatonism and earlier greek cosmology as such the classical elements appear in alchemical writings as do the seven classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity similarly the gods of the roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature the concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are central to the theory of the philosophers stone magnum opus the great work of alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colours modernity due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature and the 18thcentury diffusion of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry the general understanding of alchemy in the 19th20th century was influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations those focusing on the exoteric such as historians of science lawrence m principe and william r newman have interpreted the decknamen or code words of alchemy as physical substances these scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts at the opposite end of the spectrum focusing on the esoteric scholars such as florin george călian and anna marie roos who question the reading of principe and newman interpret these same decknamen as spiritual religious or psychological concepts new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated sometimes merging in concepts from new age or radical environmentalism movements groups like the rosicrucians and freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism since the victorian revival of alchemy occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice involving the selftransformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances which has contributed to a merger of magic and alchemy in popular thought esoteric interpretations of historical texts in the eyes of a variety of modern esoteric and neohermetic practitioners alchemy is primarily spiritual in this interpretation transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation purification and perfection according to this view early alchemists such as zosimos of panopolis 300 ad highlighted the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul this approach is held to have continued in the middle ages as metaphysical aspects substances physical states and material processes are supposed to have been used as metaphors for spiritual entities spiritual states and ultimately transformation in this sense the literal meanings of alchemical formulas hid a spiritual philosophy in the neohermeticist interpretation both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea are held to symbolize evolution from an imperfect diseased corruptible and ephemeral state toward a perfect healthy incorruptible and everlasting state so the philosophers stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible applied to the alchemist the twin goal symbolized their evolution from ignorance to enlightenment and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal in texts that are believed to have been written according to this view the cryptic alchemical symbols diagrams and textual imagery of late alchemical works are supposed to contain multiple layers of meanings allegories and references to other equally cryptic works which must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning in his 1766 alchemical catechism théodore henri de tschudi suggested that the usage of the metals was symbolic psychology alchemical symbolism has been important in analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the swiss psychologist carl gustav jung jung was initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images but after being given a copy of the secret of the golden flower a chinese alchemical text translated by his friend richard wilhelm he discovered a direct correlation or parallel between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner symbolic images coming up in his patients dreams visions or fantasies he observed these alchemical images occurring during the psychic process of transformation a process that jung called individuation specifically he regarded the conjuring up of images of gold or lapis as symbolic expressions of the origin and goal of this process of individuation together with his alchemical mystica soror mystical sister jungian swiss analyst marielouise von franz jung began collecting old alchemical texts compiled a lexicon of key phrases with crossreferences and pored over them the volumes of work he wrote shed new light onto understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemys popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites are brought into contact and inner and outer spirit and matter are reunited in the hieros gamos or divine marriage his writings are influential in general psychology but especially to those who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces archetypes that comprise all psychic life both von franz and jung have contributed significantly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture among the volumes jung wrote on alchemy his magnum opus is volume 14 of his collected works mysterium coniunctionis literature alchemy has had a longstanding relationship with art seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment literary alchemy appears throughout the history of english literature from shakespeare to j k rowling and also the popular japanese manga fullmetal alchemist here characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus in the 14th century chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of the late sir terry pratchett visual artists have had a similar relationship with alchemy while some used it as a source of satire others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers in the last hundred years alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction film television novels comics and video games

question or field outside the scope of earth they observe astronomical objects such as stars planets moons comets and galaxies  in either observational by analyzing the data or theoretical astronomy examples of topics or fields astronomers study include planetary science solar astronomy the origin or evolution of stars or the formation of galaxies a related but distinct subject is physical cosmology which studies the universe as a whole types astronomers usually fall under either of two main types observational and theoretical observational astronomers make direct observations of celestial objects and analyze the data in contrast theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that cannot be observed because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form evolve and die they use this data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial objects work further subcategories under these two main branches of astronomy include planetary astronomy galactic astronomy or physical cosmology academic historically astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws today that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms astronomer and astrophysicist are interchangeable professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a phd in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities they spend the majority of their time working on research although they quite often have other duties such as teaching building instruments or aiding in the operation of an observatory the american astronomical society which is the major organization of professional astronomers in north america has approximately 7000 members this number includes scientists from other fields such as physics geology and engineering whose research interests are closely related to astronomy the international astronomical union comprises almost 10145 members from 70 countries who are involved in astronomical research at the phd level and beyond contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night it is far more common to use a chargecoupled device ccd camera to record a long deep exposure allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time before ccds photographic plates were a common method of observation modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year analysis of observed phenomena along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe takes the majority of observational astronomers time astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths sciences and computing in high school taking courses that teach how to research write and present papers are also invaluable in collegeuniversity most astronomers get a phd in astronomy or physics amateur astronomers while there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers the field is popular among amateurs most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties the astronomical society of the pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations like any hobby most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research however amateurs span the range from socalled armchair astronomers to the very ambitious who own sciencegrade

devices other than teleprinters the use of ascii format for network interchange was described in 1969 that document was formally elevated to an internet standard in 2015 originally based on the modern english alphabet ascii encodes 128 specified characters into sevenbit integers as shown by the ascii chart in this article ninetyfive of the encoded characters are printable these include the digits 0 to 9 lowercase letters a to z uppercase letters a to z and punctuation symbols in addition the original ascii specification included 33 nonprinting control codes which originated with teletype models most of these are now obsolete although a few are still commonly used such as the carriage return line feed and tab codes for example lowercase i would be represented in the ascii encoding by binary 1101001  hexadecimal 69 i is the ninth letter  decimal 105 despite being an american standard ascii does not have a code point for the cent  it also does not support english terms with diacritical marks such as résumé and jalapeño or proper nouns with diacritical marks such as beyoncé history the american standard code for information interchange ascii was developed under the auspices of a committee of the american standards association asa called the x3 committee by its x32 later x3l2 subcommittee and later by that subcommittees x324 working group now incits the asa later became the united states of america standards institute usasi211 and ultimately became the american national standards institute ansi with the other special characters and control codes filled in ascii was published as asa x341963 leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning reserved for future standardization and one unassigned control code66 245 there was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet435 the indecision did not last long during may 1963 the ccitt working party on the new telegraph alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to sticks 6 and 7 and international organization for standardization tc 97 sc 2 voted during october to incorporate the change into its draft standard the x324 task group voted its approval for the change to ascii at its may 1963 meeting locating the lowercase letters in sticks 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit which simplified caseinsensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers the x3 committee made other changes including other new characters the brace and vertical bar characters renaming some control characters som became start of header soh and moving or removing others ru was removed247248 ascii was subsequently updated as usas x341967 then usas x341968 ansi x341977 and finally ansi x341986 revisions of the ascii standard in the x315 standard the x3 committee also addressed how ascii should be transmitted least significant bit first249253 and recorded on perforated tape they proposed a 9track standard for magnetic tape and attempted to deal with some punched card formats design considerations bit width the x32 subcommittee designed ascii based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems like other character encodings ascii specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols ie graphemes and control characters this allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process store and communicate characteroriented information such as written language before ascii was developed the encodings in use included 26 alphabetic characters 10 numerical digits and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols to include all these and control characters compatible with the comité consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique ccitt international telegraph alphabet no 2 ita2 standard of 1924 fieldata 1956june 2016 and early ebcdic 1963 more than 64 codes were required for ascii ita2 was in turn based on baudot code the 5bit telegraph code émile baudot invented in 1870 and patented in 1874 the committee debated the possibility of a shift function like in ita2 which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a sixbit code in a shifted code some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes it allows compact encoding but is less reliable for data transmission as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable the standards committee decided against shifting and so ascii required at least a sevenbit code215 136 236 4 the committee considered an eightbit code since eight bits octets would allow two fourbit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binarycoded decimal however it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice the committee voted to use a sevenbit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired217 c 236 5 eightbit machines with octets as the native data type that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0 internal organization the code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together for ease of identification the first two socalled ascii sticks 32 positions were reserved for control characters220 236 89 the space character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier so it became position 20hex237 10 for the same reason many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits the committee decided it was important to support uppercase 64character alphabets and chose to pattern ascii so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64character set of graphic codes228 237 14 as was done in the dec sixbit code 1963 lowercase letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase to keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters and the letter a was placed in position 41hex to match the draft of the corresponding british standard238 18 the digits 09 are prefixed with 011 but the remaining 4 bits correspond to their respective values in binary making conversion with binarycoded decimal straightforward for example 5 in encoded to 0110101 where 5 is 0101 in binary many of the nonalphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters an important subtlety is that these were based on mechanical typewriters not electric typewriters mechanical typewriters followed the de facto standard set by the remington no 2 1878 the first typewriter with a shift key and the shifted values of 23456789 were _snd early typewriters omitted 0 and 1 using o capital letter o and l lowercase letter l instead but 1 and 0 pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common thus in ascii  were placed in the second stick positions 15 corresponding to the digits 15 in the adjacent stick the parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0 however because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character this was accommodated by removing _ underscore from 6 and shifting the remaining characters which corresponded to many european typewriters that placed the parentheses with 8 and 9 this discrepancy from typewriters led to bitpaired keyboards notably the teletype model 33 which used the leftshifted layout corresponding to ascii differently from traditional mechanical typewriters electric typewriters notably the ibm selectric 1961 used a somewhat different layout that has become de facto standard on computerssnd following the ibm pc 1981 especially model m 1984snd and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ascii table as earlier keyboards did the  pair also dates to the no 2 and the  pairs were used on some keyboards others including the no 2 did not shift  comma or  full stop so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting however ascii split the  pair dating to no 2 and rearranged mathematical symbols varied conventions commonly   to    some thencommon typewriter characters were not included notably ½ ¼  while    were included as diacritics for international use and for mathematical use together with the simple line characters   in addition to common  the  symbol was not used in continental europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented à in the french variation so the  was placed in position 40hex right before the letter a243 the control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message som end of address eoa end of message eom end of transmission eot who are you wru are you ru a reserved device control dc0 synchronous idle sync and acknowledge ack these were positioned to maximize the hamming distance between their bit patterns243245 character order asciicode order is also called asciibetical order collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than standard alphabetical order collating sequence the main deviations in ascii order are an intermediate order converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ascii values character set character groups control characters ascii reserves the first 32 code points numbers 031 decimal and the last one number 127 decimal for control characters these are codes intended to control peripheral devices such as printers or to provide metainformation about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape despite their name these code points do not represent printable characters ie they are not characters at all but signals for debugging purposes placeholder symbols such as those given in iso 2047 and its predecessors are assigned to them for example character 0x0a represents the line feed function which causes a printer to advance its paper and character 8 represents backspace 2822 refers to control characters that do not include carriage return line feed or white space as nonwhitespace control characters except for the control characters that prescribe elementary lineoriented formatting ascii does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document other schemes such as markup languages address page and document layout and formatting the original ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream and sometimes accidental for example the standard is unclear about the meaning of delete probably the most influential single device affecting the interpretation of these characters was the teletype model 33 asr which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape readerpunch option paper tape was a very popular medium for longterm program storage until the 1980s less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape in particular the teletype model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 controlq dc1 also known as xon 19 controls dc3 also known as xoff and 127 delete became de facto standards the model 33 was also notable for taking the description of controlg code 7 bel meaning audibly alert the operator literally as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a bel character because the keytop for the o key also showed a leftarrow symbol from ascii1963 which had this character instead of underscore a noncompliant use of code 15 controlo shift in interpreted as delete previous character was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected when a teletype 33 asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a controls xoff an abbreviation for transmit off it caused the tape reader to stop receiving controlq xon transmit on caused the tape reader to resume this socalled flow control technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a handshaking signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending buffer overflow it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique on some systems controls retains its meaning but controlq is replaced by a second controls to resume output the 33 asr also could be configured to employ controlr dc2 and controlt dc4 to start and stop the tape punch on some units equipped with this function the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was tape and tape respectively delete vs backspace the teletype could not move its typehead backwards so it did not have a key on its keyboard to send a bs backspace instead there was a key marked rub out that sent code 127 del the purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a manuallyinput paper tape the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to back it up then type the rubout which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored teletypes were commonly used with the lessexpensive computers from digital equipment corporation dec these systems had to use what keys were available and thus the del character was assigned to erase the previous character because of this dec video terminals by default sent the del character for the key marked backspace while the separate key marked delete sent an escape sequence many other competing terminals sent a bs character for the backspace key the early unix tty drivers unlike some modern implementations allowed only one character to be set to erase the previous character in canonical input processing where a very simple line editor is available this could be set to bs or del but not both resulting in recurring situations of ambiguity where users had to decide depending on what terminal they were using shells that allow line editing such as ksh bash and zsh understand both the assumption that no key sent a bs character allowed ctrlh to be used for other purposes such as the help prefix command in gnu emacs escape many more of the control characters have been assigned meanings quite different from their original ones the escape character esc code 27 for example was intended originally to allow sending of other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning an escape sequence this is the same meaning of escape encountered in url encodings c language strings and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning over time this interpretation has been coopted and has eventually been changed in modern usage an esc sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence which can be used to address the cursor scroll a region setquery various terminal properties and more they are usually in the form of a socalled ansi escape code often starting with a control sequence introducer csi esc  from ecma48 1972 and its successors some escape sequences do not have introducers like the vt100 full reset command esc c in contrast an esc read from the terminal is most often used as an outofband character used to terminate an operation or special mode as in the teco and vi text editors in graphical user interface gui and windowing systems esc generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit terminate altogether end of line the inherent ambiguity of many control characters combined with their historical usage created problems when transferring plain text files between systems the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both carriage return which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line and line feed which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead the name carriage return comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moves while the typebars that strike the ribbon remain stationary the entire carriage had to be pushed returned to the right in order to position the paper for the next line dec operating systems os8 rt11 rsx11 rsts tops10 etc used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device originally teletype machines would work by the time socalled glass ttys later called crts or dumb terminals came along the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing to follow it when gary kildall created cpm he was inspired by some of the command line interface conventions used in decs rt11 operating system until the introduction of pc dos in 1981 ibm had no influence in this because their 1970s operating systems used ebcdic encoding instead of ascii and they were oriented toward punchcard input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless ibms pc dos also marketed as msdos by microsoft inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on cpm and windows in turn inherited it from msdos requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and ambiguity as to how to interpret each character when encountered by itself to simplify matters plain text data streams including files on multics used line feed lf alone as a line terminator357 the tty driver would handle the lf to crlf conversion on output so files can be directly printed to terminal and nl newline if often used to refer to crlf in unix documents unix and unixlike systems and amiga systems adopted this convention from multics on the other hand the original macintosh os apple dos and prodos used carriage return cr alone as a line terminator however since apple later replaced these obsolete operating systems with their unixbased macos formerly named os x operating system they now use line feed lf as well the radio shack trs80 also used a lone cr to terminate lines computers attached to the arpanet included machines running operating systems such as tops10 and tenex using crlf line endings machines running operating systems such as multics using lf line endings and machines running operating systems such as os360 that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and which used ebcdic rather than ascii encoding the telnet protocol defined an ascii network virtual terminal nvt so that connections between hosts with different lineending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network telnet used ascii along with crlf line endings and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt the file transfer protocol adopted the telnet protocol including use of the network virtual terminal for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ascii mode this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols and to other network protocols such as those used for email and the world wide web on systems not using the nvts crlf lineending convention end of filestream the pdp6 monitor and its pdp10 successor tops10 used controlz sub as an endoffile indication for input from a terminal some operating systems such as cpm tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used controlz to mark the end of the actual text in the file for these reasons eof or endoffile was used colloquially and conventionally as a threeletter acronym for controlz instead of substitute the endoftext character etx also known as controlc was inappropriate for a variety of reasons while using controlz as the control character to end a file is analogous to the letter zs position at the end of the alphabet and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid a historically common and still prevalent convention uses the etx character convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream usually from a keyboard the unix terminal driver uses the endoftransmission character eot also known as controld to indicate the end of a data stream in the c programming language and in unix conventions the null character is used to terminate text strings such nullterminated strings can be known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz where here z stands for zero control code chart other representations might be used by specialist equipment for example iso 2047 graphics or hexadecimal numbers printable characters codes 20hex to 7ehex known as the printable characters represent letters digits punctuation marks and a few miscellaneous symbols there are 95 printable characters in totalprinted out the characters are 0123456789zerowidthspaceabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_zerowidthspaceabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz code 20hex the space character denotes the space between words as produced by the space bar of a keyboard since the space character is considered an invisible graphic rather than a control character223 it is listed in the table below instead of in the previous section code 7fhex corresponds to the nonprintable delete del control character and is therefore omitted from this chart it is covered in the previous sections chart earlier versions of ascii used the up arrow instead of the caret 5ehex and the left arrow instead of the underscore 5fhex usage ascii was first used commercially during 1963 as a sevenbit teleprinter code for american telephone  telegraphs twx teletypewriter exchange network twx originally used the earlier fivebit ita2 which was also used by the competing telex teleprinter system bob bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence his british colleague hugh mcgregor ross helped to popularize this worksnd according to bemer so much so that the code that was to become ascii was first called the bemerross code in europe because of his extensive work on ascii bemer has been called the father of ascii on march 11 1968 us president lyndon b johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the united states federal government support ascii stating i have also approved recommendations of the secretary of commerce h hodges regarding standards for recording the standard code for information interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the federal government inventory on and after july 1 1969 must have the capability to use the standard code for information interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used ascii was the most common character encoding on the world wide web until december 2007 when utf8 encoding surpassed it utf8 is backward compatible with ascii variants and derivations as computer technology spread throughout the world different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ascii to facilitate the expression of nonenglish languages that used romanbased alphabets one could class some of these variations as ascii extensions although some misuse that term to represent all variants including those that do not preserve asciis charactermap in the 7bit range furthermore the ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as ascii 7bit codes from early in its development ascii was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as iso 646 1967 that are identical or nearly identical to ascii with extensions for characters outside the english alphabet and symbols used outside the united states such as the symbol for the united kingdoms pound sterling  eg with code page 1104 almost every country needed an adapted version of ascii since ascii suited the needs of only the us and a few other countries for example canada had its own version that supported french characters many other countries developed variants of ascii to include nonenglish letters eg é ñ ß ł currency symbols eg   etc see also yuscii yugoslavia it would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for national use however the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii1963 and isos first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused asciis choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points isoiec 646 like ascii is a 7bit character set it does not make any additional codes available so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text but they were rarely used so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented and in general textprocessing systems could cope with only one variant anyway because the bracket and brace characters of ascii were assigned to national use code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of isoiec 646 a german french or swedish etc programmer using their national variant of isoiec 646 rather than ascii had to write and thus read something such as instead of c trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ansi c although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use many programmers kept their computers on usascii so plaintext in swedish german etc for example in email or usenet contained  and similar variants in the middle of words something those programmers got used to for example a swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch could get nsar as the answer which should be nä jag har smörgåsar meaning no ive got sandwiches in japan and korea still 2021 a variation of ascii is used in which the backslash 5c hex is rendered as  a yen sign in japan or  a won sign in korea this means that for example the file path cuserssmith is shown as cuserssmith in japan or cuserssmith in korea in europe teletext character sets which are variants of ascii are used for broadcast tv subtitles defined by world system teletext and broadcast using the dvbtxt standard for embedding teletext into dvb transmissions in the case that the subtitles were initially authored for teletext and converted the derived subtitle formats are constrained to the same character sets 8bit codes eventually as 8 16 and 32bit and later 64bit computers began to replace 12 18 and 36bit computers as the norm it became common to use an 8bit byte to store each character in memory providing an opportunity for extended 8bit relatives of ascii in most cases these developed as true extensions of ascii leaving the original charactermapping intact but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 ie 7bit characters for some countries 8bit extensions of ascii were developed that included support for characters used in local languages for example iscii for india and viscii for vietnam kaypro cpm computers used the upper 128 characters for the greek alphabetnovember 2023 even for markets where it was not necessary to add many characters to support additional languages manufacturers of early home computer systems often developed their own 8bit extensions of ascii to include additional characters such as boxdrawing characters semigraphics and video game sprites often these additions also replaced control characters index 0 to 31 as well as index 127 with even more platformspecific extensions in other cases the extra bit was used for some other purpose such as toggling inverse video this approach was used by atascii an extension of ascii developed by atari most ascii extensions are based on ascii1967 the current standard but some extensions are instead based on the earlier ascii1963 for example petscii which was developed by commodore international for their 8bit systems is based on ascii1963 likewise many sharp mz character sets are based on ascii1963 ibm defined code page 437 for the ibm pc replacing the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces and mapping additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions digital equipment corporation developed the multinational character set decmcs for use in the popular vt220 terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics apple defined mac os roman for the macintosh and adobe defined the postscript standard encoding for postscript both sets contained international letters typographic symbols and punctuation marks instead of graphics more like modern character sets the isoiec 8859 standard derived from the decmcs provided a standard that most systems copied or at least were based on when not copied exactly a popular further extension designed by microsoft windows1252 often mislabeled as iso88591 added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing iso88591 windows1252 and the original 7bit ascii were the most common character encodings on the world wide web until 2008 when utf8 overtook them isoiec 4873 introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 809f hexadecimal range as part of extending the 7bit ascii encoding to become an 8bit system unicode unicode and the isoiec 10646 universal character set ucs have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant isoiec 8859 and ascii rapidly in many environments while ascii is limited to 128 characters unicode and the ucs support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification using natural numbers called code points and encoding to 8 16 or 32bit binary formats called utf8 utf16 and utf32 respectively ascii was incorporated into the unicode 1991 character set as the first 128 symbols so the 7bit ascii characters have the same numeric codes in both sets this allows utf8 to be backward compatible with 7bit ascii as a utf8 file containing only ascii characters is identical to an ascii file containing the same sequence of characters even more importantly forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only 7bit ascii characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set as is often done to support 8bit ascii extensions such as iso88591 will preserve utf8 data unchanged see also notes references further reading external links austin

articles containing video clips film and video technology animation is a filmmaking technique by which still images are manipulated to create moving images in traditional animation images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets cels to be photographed and exhibited on film animation has been recognized as an artistic medium specifically within the entertainment industry many animations are computer animations made with computergenerated imagery cgi stop motion animation in particular claymation has continued to exist alongside these other forms animation is contrasted with liveaction film although the two do not exist in isolation many moviemakers have produced films that are a hybrid of the two as cgi increasingly approximates photographic imagery filmmakers can easily composite 3d animations into their film rather than using practical effects for showy visual effects vfx general overview computer animation can be very detailed 3d animation while 2d computer animation which may have the look of traditional animation can be used for stylistic reasons low bandwidth or faster realtime renderings other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and threedimensional objects like paper cutouts puppets or clay figures a cartoon is an animated film usually a short film featuring an exaggerated visual style the style takes inspiration from comic strips often featuring anthropomorphic animals superheroes or the adventures of human protagonists especially with animals that form a natural predatorprey relationship eg cats and mice coyotes and birds the action often centers on violent pratfalls such as falls collisions and explosions that would be lethal in real life the illusion of animationas in motion pictures in generalhas traditionally been attributed to the persistence of vision and later to the phi phenomenon and beta movement but the exact neurological causes are still uncertain the illusion of motion caused by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other with unnoticeable interruptions is a stroboscopic effect while animators traditionally used to draw each part of the movements and changes of figures on transparent cels that could be moved over a separate background computer animation is usually based on programming paths between key frames to maneuver digitally created figures throughout a digitally created environment analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope zoetrope flip book praxinoscope and film television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally for display on computers technology such as the animated gif and flash animation were developed in addition to short films feature films television series animated gifs and other media dedicated to the display of moving images animation is also prevalent in video games motion graphics user interfaces and visual effects the physical movement of image parts through simple mechanicsfor instance moving images in magic lantern showscan also be considered animation the mechanical manipulation of threedimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in automata electronic automata were popularized by disney as animatronics etymology the word animation stems from the latin animātiōn stem of animātiō meaning a bestowing of life the earlier meaning of the english word is liveliness and has been in use much longer than the meaning of moving image medium history before cinematography long before modern animation began audiences around the world were captivated by the magic of moving characters for centuries master artists and craftsmen have brought puppets automatons shadow puppets and fantastical lanterns to life inspiring the imagination through physically manipulated wonders in 1833 the stroboscopic disc better known as the phénakisticope introduced the principle of modern animation which would also be applied in the zoetrope introduced in 1866 the flip book 1868 the praxinoscope 1877 and film silent era when cinematography eventually broke through in the 1890s the wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment it took years before animation found its way to the cinemas the successful short the haunted hotel 1907 by j stuart blackton popularized stopmotion and reportedly inspired émile cohl to create fantasmagorie 1908 regarded as the oldest known example of a complete traditional handdrawn animation on standard cinematographic film other great artistic and very influential short films were created by ladislas starevich with his puppet animations since 1910 and by winsor mccay with detailed handdrawn animation in films such as little nemo 1911 and gertie the dinosaur 1914 during the 1910s the production of animated cartoons became an industry in the us successful producer john randolph bray and animator earl hurd patented the cel animation process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century felix the cat who debuted in 1919 became the first fully realized animal character in the history of american animation american golden age in 1928 steamboat willie featuring mickey mouse and minnie mouse popularized film with synchronized sound and put walt disneys studio at the forefront of the animation industry although disney animations actual output relative to total global animation output has always been very small the studio has overwhelmingly dominated the aesthetic norms of animation ever since the enormous success of mickey mouse is seen as the start of the golden age of american animation that would last until the 1960s the united states dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of celanimated theatrical shorts several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and

many hours watching saturdaymorning cartoons many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s the production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to tv series hannabarbera productions was especially prolific and had huge hit series such as the flintstones 19601966 the first prime time animated series scoobydoo since 1969 and belgian coproduction the smurfs 19811989 the constraints of american television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker limited animation methods and much more formulaic scripts quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series the first cartoon of the simpsons 1987 the animated television series such as the simpsons since 1989 and spongebob squarepants since 1999 as part of a renaissance of american animationdecember 2022 while us animated series also spawned successes internationally many other countries produced their own childoriented programming relatively often preferring stop motion and puppetry over cel animation japanese anime tv series became very successful internationally since the 1960s and european producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started coproductions with japanese studios resulting in hit series such as barbapapa the netherlandsjapanfrance 19731977 wickie und die starken männer小さなバイキング ビッケ vicky the viking austriagermanyjapan 1974 maya the bee japangermany 1975 and the jungle book italyjapan 1989december 2022 switch from cels to computers computer animation was gradually developed since the 1940s 3d wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s with an early short appearance in the scifi thriller futureworld 1976 the rescuers down under was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera it was produced using the computer animation production system caps developed by pixar in collaboration with the walt disney company in the late 1980s in a style similar to traditional cel animation  the socalled 3d style more often associated with computer animation became the dominant technique following the success of pixars toy story 1995 the first computeranimated feature in this style most of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computeranimated films around the 1990s as it proved cheaper and more profitable not only the very popular 3d animation style was generated with computers but also most of the films and series with a more traditional handcrafted appearance in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects economic status in 2010 the animation market was estimated to be worth circa us80 billion by 2020 the value had increased to an estimated us270 billion animated featurelength films returned the highest gross margins around 52 of all film genres between 2004 and 2013 animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early 2020s education propaganda and commercials the clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality it has therefore been widely used for other purposes than mere entertainmentdecember 2022 during world war ii animation was widely exploited for propaganda many american studios including warner bros and disney lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey to the public certain war values some countries including china japan and the united kingdom produced their first featurelength animation for their war effortsdecember 2022 animation has been very popular in television commercials both due to its graphic appeal and the humour it can provide some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades such as snap crackle and pop in advertisements for kelloggs cereals tex avery was the producer of the first raid kills bugs dead commercials in 1966 which were very successful for the company other media merchandise and theme parks apart from their success in movie theaters and television series many cartoon characters would also prove lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media animation has traditionally been very closely related to comic books while many comic book characters found their way to the screen which is often the case in japan where many manga are adapted into anime original animated characters also commonly appear in comic books and magazines somewhat similarly characters and plots for video games an interactive form of animation that became its own medium have been derived from films and vice versa some of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media stories and images can easily be adapted into childrens books and other printed media songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming mediadecember 2022 while very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media the walt disney company is the best known and most extreme example since first being licensed for a childrens writing tablet in 1929 their mickey mouse mascot has been depicted on an enormous amount of products as have many other disney characters this may have influenced some pejorative use of mickeys name but licensed disney products sell well and the socalled disneyana has many avid collectors and even a dedicated disneyana fan club since 1984 disneyland opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on disneys cartoon characters its enormous success spawned several other disney theme parks and resorts disneys earnings from the theme parks have relatively often been higher than those from their movies awards as with any other form of media animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field many are part of general or regional film award programs like the chinas golden rooster award for best animation since 1981 awards programs dedicated to animation with many categories include asifahollywoods annie awards the emile awards in europe and the anima mundi awards in brazil academy awards apart from academy awards for best animated short film since 1932 and best animated feature since 2002 animated movies have been nominated and rewarded in other categories relatively often for best original song and best original score beauty and the beast was the first animated film nominated for best picture in 1991 up 2009 and toy story 3 2010 also received best picture nominations after the academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten production the creation of nontrivial animation works ie longer than a few seconds has developed as a form of filmmaking with certain unique aspects traits common to both liveaction and animated featurelength films are labor intensity and high production costs the most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase the marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than liveaction films it is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more take during principal photography of a liveaction film but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation it is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling fiveminute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film thus animation studios starting with disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole while liveaction films are now also storyboarded they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards ie realtime improvisationdecember 2022 another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a films consistency from start to finish even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger animators like all artists necessarily have individual styles but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film since the early 1980s teams of about 500 to 600 people of whom 50 to 70 are animators typically have created featurelength animated films it is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult this problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins character designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions posed in different positions and viewed from different angles on traditionally animated projects maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles unlike liveaction films animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film in the early 1960s animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays while also continuing to use story departments and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980sdecember 2022 techniques traditional traditional animation also called cel animation or handdrawn animation was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century the individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings first drawn on paper to create the illusion of movement each drawing differs slightly from the one before it the animators drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings the completed character cels are photographed onebyone against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film the traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century today animators drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects the final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media including traditional 35 mm film and newer media with digital video the look of traditional cel animation is still preserved and the character animators work has remained essentially the same over the past 90 years some animation producers have used the term tradigital a play on the words traditional and digital to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology examples of traditionally animated feature films include pinocchio united states 1940 animal farm united kingdom 1954 lucky and zorba italy 1998 and the illusionist britishfrench 2010 traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include the lion king us 1994 the prince of egypt us 1998 akira japan 1988 spirited away japan 2001 the triplets of belleville france 2003 and the secret of kells irishfrenchbelgian 2009 full full animation is the process of producing highquality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement having a smooth animation fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles from more realistically animated works like those produced by the walt disney studio the little mermaid beauty and the beast aladdin the lion king to the more cartoon styles of the warner bros animation studio many of the disney animated features are examples of full animation as are nondisney works the secret of nimh us 1982 the iron giant us 1999 and nocturna spain 2007 fully animated films are often animated on twos sometimes on ones which means that 12 to 24 drawings are required for a single second of film limited limited animation involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or skippy movement animation limited animation uses fewer drawings per second thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation this is a more economic technique pioneered by the artists at the american studio united productions of america limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression as in gerald mcboingboing us 1951 yellow submarine uk 1968 and certain anime produced in japan its primary use however has been in producing costeffective animated content for media for television the work of hannabarbera filmation and other tv animation studios and later the internet web cartoons rotoscoping rotoscoping is a technique patented by max fleischer in 1917 where animators trace liveaction movement frame by frame the source film can be directly copied from actors outlines into animated drawings as in the lord of the rings us 1978 or used in a stylized and expressive manner as in waking life us 2001 and a scanner darkly us 2006 some other examples are fire and ice us 1983 heavy metal 1981 and aku no hana japan 2013december 2022 liveaction blending liveactionanimation is a technique combining handdrawn characters into live action shots or liveaction actors into animated shots one of the earlier uses was in koko the clown when koko was drawn over liveaction footage walt disney and ub iwerks created a series of alice comedies 19231927 in which a liveaction girl enters an animated world other examples include allegro non troppo italy 1976 who framed roger rabbit us 1988 volere volare italy 1991 space jam us 1996 and osmosis jones us 2001december 2022 stop motion stop motion is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating realworld objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement there are many different types of stopmotion animation usually named after the materials used to create the animation computer software is widely available to create this type of animation traditional stopmotion animation is usually less expensive but more timeconsuming to produce than current computer animation computer computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer 2d animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3d techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact 3d animation can create images that seem real to the viewer 2d 2d animation figures are created or edited on the computer using 2d bitmap graphics and 2d vector graphics this includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques interpolated morphing onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping 2d animation has many applications including after effects animation analog computer animation flash animation and powerpoint animation cinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an animated gif file of which part is animated final line advection animation is a technique used in 2d animation to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department speaking about using this approach in paperman john kahrs said that our animators can change things actually erase away the cg underlayer if they want and change the profile of the arm 3d 3d animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator the 3d model maker usually starts by creating a 3d polygon mesh for the animator to manipulate a mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces which give the visual appearance of form to a 3d object or 3d environment sometimes the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices this process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with key frames to create movement other techniques can be applied mathematical functions eg gravity particle simulations simulated fur or hair and effects fire and water simulations these techniques fall under the category of 3d dynamics terms mechanical other see also references citations sources journal

olympian deities in classical greek and roman religion and greek and roman mythology apollo has been recognized as a god of archery music and dance truth and prophecy healing and diseases the sun and light poetry and more one of the most important and complex of the greek gods he is the son of zeus and leto and the twin brother of artemis goddess of the hunt he is considered to be the most beautiful god and is represented as the ideal of the kouros ephebe or a beardless athletic youth apollo is known in greekinfluenced etruscan mythology as apulu as the patron deity of delphi apollo pythios apollo is an oracular godthe prophetic deity of the delphic oracle and also the deity of ritual purification his oracles were often consulted for guidance in various matters he was in general seen as the god who affords help and wards off evil and is referred to as grc the averter of evil medicine and healing are associated with apollo whether through the god himself or mediated through his son asclepius apollo delivered people from epidemics yet he is also a god who could bring ill health and deadly plague with his arrows the invention of archery itself is credited to apollo and his sister artemis apollo is usually described as carrying a silver or golden bow and a quiver of silver or golden arrows as the god of mousike apollo presides over all music songs dance and poetry he is the inventor of stringmusic and the frequent companion of the muses functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations the lyre is a common attribute of apollo protection of the young is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona as a grc apollo is concerned with the health and education of children and he presided over their passage into adulthood long hair which was the prerogative of boys was cut at the coming of age grc and dedicated to apollo the god himself is depicted with long uncut hair to symbolise his eternal youth apollo is an important pastoral deity and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds protection of herds flocks and crops from diseases pests and predators were his primary rustic duties on the other hand apollo also encouraged the founding of new towns and the establishment of civil constitutions is associated with dominion over colonists and was the giver of laws his oracles were often consulted before setting laws in a city apollo agyieus was the protector of the streets public places and home entrances in hellenistic times especially during the 5th century bce as apollo helios he became identified among greeks with helios the personification of the sun in latin texts however there was no conflation of apollo with sol among the classical latin poets until 1st century ce apollo and heliossol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 5th century ce etymology apollo attic ionic and homeric greek ἀπόλλων grc gen ἀπόλλωνος doric ἀπέλλων grc arcadocypriot ἀπείλων grc aeolic ἄπλουν grc apollō the name apollounlike the related older name paeanis generally not found in the linear b mycenean greek texts although there is a possible attestation in the lacunose form perjolinear b linb on the kn e 842 tablet though it has also been suggested that the name might actually read hyperion uperjone the etymology of the name is uncertain the spelling ἀπόλλων apóllɔːn in classical attic had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era but the doric form grc ἀπέλλων is more archaic as it is derived from an earlier ἀπέλjων it probably is a cognate to the doric month apellaios ἀπελλαῖος and the offerings grc ἀπελλαῖα at the initiation of the young men during the familyfestival grc ἀπέλλαι according to some scholars the words are derived from the doric word grc ἀπέλλα which originally meant wall fence for animals and later assembly within the limits of the square apella ἀπέλλα is the name of the popular assembly in sparta corresponding to the grc ἐκκλησία r s p beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun grc and suggested a pregreek protoform apalyun several instances of popular etymology are attested by ancient authors thus the greeks most often associated apollos name with the greek verb ἀπόλλυμι grc to destroy plato in cratylus connects the name with ἀπόλυσις grc redemption with ἀπόλουσις apolousis purification and with ἁπλοῦν grc simple in particular in reference to the thessalian form of the name ἄπλουν and finally with ἀειβάλλων grc evershooting hesychius connects the name apollo with the doric ἀπέλλα grc which means assembly so that apollo would be the god of political life and he also gives the explanation σηκός grc fold in which case apollo would be the god of flocks and herds in the ancient macedonian language πέλλα grc means stone and some toponyms may be derived from this word πέλλα pella the capital of ancient macedonia and πελλήνη pellēnēpellene the hittite form apaliunas dxappaliunaaš is attested in the manapatarhunta letter the hittite testimony reflects an early form apeljōn which may also be surmised from the comparison of cypriot ἀπείλων with doric ἀπέλλων the name of the lydian god qλdãns kʷʎðãns may reflect an earlier kʷalyán before palatalization syncope and the prelydian sound change y  d note the labiovelar in place of the labial p found in predoric ἀπέλjων and hittite apaliunas a luwian etymology suggested for apaliunas makes apollo the one of entrapment perhaps in the sense of hunter grecoroman epithets apollos chief epithet was phoebus ˈ fee φοῖβος phoibos pʰóibos literally bright it was very commonly used by both the greeks and romans for apollos role as the god of light like other greek deities he had a number of others applied to him reflecting the variety of roles duties and aspects ascribed to the god however while apollo has a great number of appellations in greek myth only a few occur in latin literature sun wolf origin and birth apollos birthplace was mount cynthus on the island of delos place of worship delphi and actium were his primary places of worship healing and disease founder and protector prophecy and truth music and arts archery appearance amazons celtic epithets and cult titles apollo was worshipped throughout the roman empire in the traditionally celtic lands he was most often seen as a healing and sun god he was often equated with celtic gods of similar character origins apollo is considered the most hellenic greek of the olympian gods the cult centers of apollo in greece delphi and delos date from the 8th century bce the delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to artemis apollos twin sister at delphi apollo was venerated as the slayer of the monstrous serpent python for the greeks apollo was the most greek of all the gods and through the centuries he acquired different functions in archaic greece he was the prophet the oracular god who in older times was connected with healing in classical greece he was the god of light and of music but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil walter burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of apollo worship which he termed a doriannorthwest greek component a cretanminoan component and a syrohittite component healer and godprotector from evil in classical times his major function in popular religion was to keep away evil and he was therefore called apotropaios ἀποτρόπαιος averting evil and alexikakos ἀλεξίκακος keeping off ill from v ἀλέξω  n κακόν apollo also had many epithets relating to his function as a healer some commonlyused examples are paion παιών literally healer or helper epikourios ἐπικούριος succouring oulios οὔλιος healer baleful and loimios λοίμιος of the plague in later writers the word paion usually spelled paean becomes a mere epithet of apollo in his capacity as a god of healing apollo in his aspect of healer has a connection to the primitive god paean παιώνπαιήων who did not have a cult of his own paean serves as the healer of the gods in the iliad and seems to have originated in a pregreek religion it is suggested though unconfirmed that he is connected to the mycenaean figure pajawone linear b 𐀞𐀊𐀺𐀚 paean was the personification of holy songs sung by seerdoctors ἰατρομάντεις which were supposed to cure disease homer illustrated paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph such songs were originally addressed to apollo and afterwards to other gods to dionysus to apollo helios to apollos son asclepius the healer about the 4th century bce the paean became merely a formula of adulation its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered it was in this way that apollo had become recognized as the god of music apollos role as the slayer of the python led to his association with battle and victory hence it became the roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle when a fleet left the harbour and also after a victory had been won in the iliad apollo is the healer under the gods but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows similar to the function of the vedic god of disease rudra he sends a plague λοιμός to the achaeans knowing that apollo can prevent a recurrence of the plague he sent they purify themselves in a ritual and offer him a large sacrifice of cows called a hecatomb dorian origin the homeric hymn to apollo depicts apollo as an intruder from the north the connection with the northerndwelling dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month apellaios in northwest greek calendars the familyfestival was dedicated to apollo doric ἀπέλλων apellaios is the month of these rites and apellon is the megistos kouros the great kouros however it can explain only the doric type of the name which is connected with the ancient macedonian word pella pella stone stones played an important part in the cult of the god especially in the oracular shrine of delphi omphalos minoan origin george huxley regarded the identification of apollo with the minoan deity paiawon worshipped in crete to have originated at delphi in the homeric hymn apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried cretan priests to delphi where they evidently transferred their religious practices apollo delphinios or delphidios was a seagod especially worshipped in crete and in the islands apollos sister artemis who was the greek goddess of hunting is identified with britomartis diktynna the minoan mistress of the animals in her earliest depictions she was accompanied by the master of the animals a bowwielding god of hunting whose name has been lost aspects of this figure may have been absorbed into the more popular apollo anatolian origin a nongreek origin of apollo has long been assumed in scholarship the name of apollos mother leto has lydian origin and she was worshipped on the coasts of asia minor the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into greece from anatolia which is the origin of sibyl and where some of the oldest oracular shrines originated omens symbols purifications and exorcisms appear in old assyrobabylonian texts these rituals were spread into the empire of the hittites and from there into greece homer pictures apollo on the side of the trojans fighting against the achaeans during the trojan war he is pictured as a terrible god less trusted by the greeks than other gods the god seems to be related to appaliunas a tutelary god of wilusa troy in asia minor but the word is not complete the stones found in front of the gates of homeric troy were the symbols of apollo a western anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of artimus artemis and qλdãns whose name may be cognate with the hittite and doric forms in surviving lydian texts however recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of qλdãns with apollo the greeks gave to him the name ἀγυιεύς agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column however while usually greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon all the feasts of apollo were celebrated on the seventh day of the month and the emphasis given to that day sibutu indicates a babylonian origin protoindoeuropean the vedic rudra has some similar functions to apollo the terrible god is called the archer and the bow is also an attribute of shiva rudra could bring diseases with his arrows but he was able to free people of them and his alternative shiva is a healer physician god however the indoeuropean component of apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens exorcisms and with the oracular cult oracular cult unusually among the olympic deities apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence delos and delphi in cult practice delian apollo and pythian apollo the apollo of delphi were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality lycia was sacred to the god for this apollo was also called lycian apollos cult was already fully established when written sources commenced about 650 bce apollo became extremely important to the greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period and the frequency of theophoric names such as apollodorus or apollonios and cities named apollonia testify to his popularity oracular sanctuaries to apollo were established in other sites in the 2nd and 3rd century ce those at didyma and claros pronounced the socalled theological oracles in which apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an allencompassing highest deity in the 3rd century apollo fell silent julian the apostate 359361 tried to revive the delphic oracle but failed oracular shrines apollo had a famous oracle in delphi and other notable ones in claros and didyma his oracular shrine in abae in phocis where he bore the toponymic epithet abaeus ἀπόλλων ἀβαῖος apollon abaios was important enough to be consulted by croesus his oracular shrines include oracles were also given by sons of apollo temples of apollo many temples were dedicated to apollo in greece and the greek colonies they show the spread of the cult of apollo and the evolution of greek architecture which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations some of the earliest temples especially in crete do not belong to any greek order it seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures the different wooden elements were considered divine and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of doric order the greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances the temples should be canonic and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings the first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms this probably influenced the theory of numbers of pythagoras who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics the doric order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century bc but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs which couldnt be solved without changing the original forms the order was almost abandoned for the ionic order but the ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple both orders were abandoned for the corinthian order gradually during the hellenistic age and under rome the most important temples are greek temples etruscan and roman temples mythology in the myths apollo is the son of zeus the king of the gods and leto his previous wife or one of his mistresses apollo often appears in the myths plays and hymns either directly or indirectly through his oracles as zeus favorite son he had direct access to the mind of zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans a divinity beyond human comprehension he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god birth homeric hymn to apollo pregnant with the offsprings of zeus leto wandered through many lands wanting to give birth to apollo however all the lands rejected her out of fear upon reaching delos leto requested the island to shelter her and that in return her son would bring fame and prosperity to the island delos then revealed to leto that apollo was rumoured to be the god who will greatly lord it among gods and men all over the fruitful earth for this reason all the lands were fearful and delos feared that apollo would cast her aside once he is born hearing this leto swore on the river styx that if she is allowed to give birth on the island her son would honour delos the most amongst all the other lands assured by this delos agreed to assist leto all goddesses except hera also came to aid leto however hera had tricked eileithyia the goddess of childbirth to stay on olympus due to which leto was unable to give birth the goddesses then convinced iris to go bring eileithyia by offering her a necklace of amber 9 yards 82 m long iris did accordingly and persuaded eileithyia to step onto the island thus clutching a palm tree leto finally gave birth after labouring for nine days and nine nights with apollo leaping forth from his mothers womb the goddesses washed the new born covered him in a white garment and fastened golden bands around him as leto was unable to feed him themis the goddess of divine law fed him nectar and ambrosia upon tasting the divine food the child broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of lyre and archery and interpret the will of zeus to humankind he then started to walk which caused the island to be filled with gold callimachus hymn to delos the island delos used to be asteria a goddess who jumped into the waters to escape the advances of zeus and became a freefloating island of the same name when leto got pregnant hera was told that letos son would become more dear to zeus than ares enraged by this hera watched over the heavens and sent out ares and iris to prevent leto from giving birth on the earth ares stationed over the mainland and iris over the islands threatened all the lands and prevented them from helping leto when leto arrived at thebes fetal apollo prophesied from his mothers womb that in the future he would punish a slanderous woman in thebes niobe so he did not want to be born there leto then went to thessaly and sought the help of the river nymphs who were the daughters of the river peneus though he was initially fearful and reluctant peneus later decided to let leto give birth in his waters he did not change his mind even when ares produced a terrifying sound and threatened to hurl mountain peaks into the river but leto herself declined his help and departed as she did not want him to suffer for her sake after being turned away from various lands apollo spoke again from the womb asking his mother to take look at the floating island in front of her and expressing his wish to be born there when leto approached asteria all the other islands fled but asteria welcomed leto without any fear of hera walking on the island she sat down against a palm tree and asked apollo to be born during the childbirth swans circled the island seven times a sign that later on apollo would play the sevenstringed lyre when apollo finally leapt forth from his mothers womb the nymphs of the island sang a hymn to eileithyia that was heard to the heavens the moment apollo was born the entire island including the trees and the waters became gold asteria bathed the newborn swaddled him and fed him with her breast milk the island had become rooted and was later called delos hera was no longer angry as zeus had managed to calm her down and she held no grudge against asteria since asteria had rejected zeus in the past pindars fragments pindar is the earliest source who explicitly calls apollo and artemis as twins here asteria is also stated to be letos sister wanting escape zeus advances she flung herself into the sea and became a floating rock called ortygia until the twins were born when leto stepped on the rock four pillars with adamantine bases rose from the earth and held up the rock when apollo and artemis were born their bodies shone radiantly and a chant was sung by eileithyia and lachesis one of the three moirai pseudohyginus scorning the advances of zeus asteria transformed herself into a bird and jumped into a sea from her an island rose which was called ortygia when hera discovered that leto was pregnant with zeus child she decreed that leto can give birth only in a place where sun does not shine during this time the monster python also started hounding leto with an intent of killing her because he had foreseen his death coming at the hands of letos offspring however on zeus orders boreas carried away leto and entrusted her to poseidon to protect her poseidon took her to the island ortygia and covered it with waves so that the sun would not shine on it leto gave birth clinging to an olive tree and henceforth the island was called delos other variations of apollos birth include aelian states that it took leto twelve days and twelve nights to travel from hyperborea to delos leto changed herself into a shewolf before giving birth this is given as the reason why homer describes apollo as the wolfborn god libanius wrote that neither land nor visible islands would receive leto but by the will of zeus delos then became visible and thus received leto and the children according to strabo the curetes helped leto by creating loud noises with their weapons and thus frightening hera they concealed letos childbirth theognis wrote that the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance when apollo was born and the earth laughed with joy while in some accounts apollos birth itself fixed the floating delos to the earth there are accounts of apollo securing delos to the bottom of the ocean a little while later this island became sacred to apollo and was one of the major cult centres of the god apollo was born on the seventh day ἑβδομαγενής hebdomagenes of the month thargelionaccording to delian traditionor of the month bysiosaccording to delphian tradition the seventh and twentieth the days of the new and full moon were ever afterwards held sacred to him the general consensus is that artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of apollo hyperborea hyperborea the mystical land of eternal spring venerated apollo above all the gods the hyperboreans always sang and danced in his honor and hosted pythian games there a vast forest of beautiful trees was called the garden of apollo apollo spent the winter months among the hyperboreans leaving his shrine in delphi under the care of dionysus his absence from the world caused coldness and this was marked as his annual death no prophecies were issued during this time he returned to the world during the beginning of the spring the theophania festival was held in delphi to celebrate his return however diodorus silculus states that apollo visited hyperborea every nineteen years this nineteenyear period was called by the greeks as the year of meton the time period in which the stars returned to their initial positions and that visiting hyperborea at that time apollo played on the cithara and danced continuously from the vernal equinox until the rising of the pleiades constellations hyperborea was also letos birthplace it is said that leto came to delos from hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves henceforth hyperborea became apollos winter home and wolves became sacred to him his intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet lyceus meaning wolflike but apollo was also the wolfslayer in his role as the god who protected flocks from predators the hyperborean worship of apollo bears the strongest marks of apollo being worshipped as the sun god shamanistic elements in apollos cult are often liked to his hyperborean origin and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman shamans like abaris and aristeas were also the followers of apollo who hailed from hyperborea in myths the tears of amber apollo shed when his son asclepius died mixed with the waters of the river eridanos which surrounded hyperborea apollo also buried in hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the cyclopes he later gave this arrow to abaris childhood and youth growing up apollo was nursed by the nymphs korythalia and aletheia the personification of truth phoebe his grandmother gave the oracular shrine of delphi to apollo as a birthday gift as a fouryearold child apollo built a foundation and an altar on delos using the horns of the goats that his sister artemis hunted since he learnt the art of building when young he came to be known as archegetes the founder of towns and guided men to build new cities to keep the child amused the delian nymphs ran around the altar beating it and then with their hands tied behind their backs bit an olive branch it later became a custom for all the sailors who passed by the island to do the same from his father zeus apollo received a golden headband and a chariot driven by swans in his early years when apollo spent his time herding cows he was reared by the thriae who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills the god pan was also said to mentored him in the prophetic art apollo is also said to have invented the lyre and along with artemis the art of archery he then taught the humans the art of healing and archery lycian peasants soon after giving birth to her twins leto fled from delos fearing hera upon reaching lycia her infants had drained all of their mothers milk and cried for more to satisfy their hunger the exhausted mother then tried drinking from a nearby lake but was stopped by some lycian peasants when she begged them to let her quench her thirst the haughty peasants not only threatened her but also stirred the mud in the lake to dirty the waters angered by this leto turned them into frogs in a slightly varied version leto took her infants and crossed over to lycia where she attempted to bathe her children in a spring she found there but the local herdsmen drove her away after that some wolves found leto and guided her to the river xanthos where leto was able to bathe her children and quench her thirst she then returned to the spring and turned the herdsmen into frogs slaying of python python a chthonic serpentdragon was a child of gaia and the guardian of the delphic oracle in the callimachus hymn to delos fetal apollo foresees the death of python at his hands in the homeric hymn to apollo python was a female drakon and the nurse of the giant typhon whom hera had created to overthrow zeus she was described as a terrifying monster and a bloody plague apollo in his pursuit to establish his worship came across python and killed her with a single arrow shot from his bow he let the corpse rot under the sun and declared himself the oracular deity of delphi other authors have apollo kill the monster using a hundred arrows or a thousand arrows according to euripides leto had brought her twins to the cliffs of parnassus shortly after giving birth to them upon seeing the monster there apollo still a child being carried in his mothers arms leapt forth and killed python some authors also mention that python was killed for displaying lustful affections towards leto in another account python chased pregnant leto with an intent of killing her because his death was fated to come at the hands of letos child however he had to stop the chase when leto came under the protection of poseidon after his birth four days old apollo killed the serpent with the bow and arrows gifted to him by hephaestus and avenged the trouble given to his mother the god then put the bones of the slain monster in a cauldron and deposited it in his temple this legend is also narrated as the origin of the cry hië paian according to athenaeus pyhton attacked leto and her twins during their visit to delphi taking artemis into her arms leto climbed upon a rock and cried at apollo to shoot the monster the cry let out by her ιε παῖ shoot boy later got slightly altered as ἰὴ παιών hië paian an exclamation to avert evils callimachus attributes the origin of this phrase to the delphians who let out the cry to encourage apollo when the young god battled with python strabo has recorded a slightly different version where python was actually a cruel and lawless man who was also known by the name drakon when apollo was teaching the humans to cultivate fruits and civilise themselves the residents of parnassus complained to the god about python in response to their pleas apollo killed the man with his arrows during the fight the parnassians shouted hië paian to encourage the god establishment of worship in delphi continuing from his victory over python the homeric hymn describes how the young god established his worship among the humans as apollo was pondering about what kind of men he should recruit to serve him he spotted a ship full of cretan merchants or pirates he took the form of a dolphin and sprang aboard the ship whenever the oblivious crew members tried throwing the dolphin overboard the god shook the ship until the crew was awed into submission apollo then created a breeze that directed the ship to delphi upon reaching the land he revealed himself as a god and initiated them as his priests he instructed them to guard his temple and always keep righteousness in their hearts alcaeus narrates the following account zeus who had adorned his newborn son with a golden headband also provided him with a chariot driven by swans and instructed apollo to visit delphi to establish his laws among the people but apollo disobeyed his father and went to the land of hyperborea the delphians continuously sung paeans in his honour and pleaded him to come back to them the god returned only after a year and then carried out zeus orders in other variations the shrine at delphi was simply handed over to apollo by his grandmother phoebe as a gift or themis herself inspired him to be the oracular voice of delphi however in many other accounts apollo had to overcome certain obstacles before he was able to establish himself at delphi gaea came in conflict with apollo for killing python and claiming the delphic oracle for himself according to pindar she sought to banish apollo to tartarus as a punishment according to euripides soon after apollo took the ownership of the oracle gaea started sending prophetic dreams to the humans as a result people stopped visiting delphi to obtain prophecies troubled by this apollo went to olympus and supplicated to zeus zeus admiring the ambitions of his young son granted his request by putting an end to the dream visions this sealed the role of apollo as the oracular deity of delphi since apollo had committed a blood crime he also had to be purified pausanias has recorded two of the many variations of this purification in one of them both apollo and artemis fled to sicyon and were purified there in the other tradition that had been prevalent among the cretans apollo alone travelled to crete and was purified by carmanor in another account the argive king crotopus was the one who performed the purification rites on apollo alone according the aristonous and aelian apollo was purified by the will of zeus in the vale of tempe aristonous has continued the tale saying that apollo was escorted back to delphi by athena as a token of gratitude he later built a temple for athena at delphi which served as a threshold for his own temple upon reaching delphi apollo convinced gaea and themis into handing over the seat of oracle to him to celebrate this event other immortals also graced apollo with gifts  poseidon gave him the land of delphi the delphian nymphs gifted him the corycian cave and artemis set her dogs to patrol and safeguard the land some others have also said that apollo was exiled and subjected to servitude under king admetus as a means of punishment for the murder he had committed it was when he was serving as a cowherd under admetus that the theft of the cattle by hermes happened the servitude was said to have lasted for either one year or one great year a cycle of eight years or nine years plutarch however has mentioned a variation where apollo was neither purified in tempe nor banished to earth as a servant for nine years but was driven out to another world for nine great years the god who returned was cleansed and purified thus becoming a true phoebus  that is to say clear and bright he then took over the delphic oracle which had been under the care of themis in his absence henceforth apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder made men aware of their guilt and purified them the pythian games were also established by apollo either as funeral games to honor python or to celebrate his own victory the pythia was apollos high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies tityus tityus was another giant who tried to rape leto either on his own accord when she was on her way to delphi or at the order of hera leto called upon on her children who instantly slew the giant apollo still a young boy shot him with his arrows in some accounts artemis also joined him in protecting their mother by attacking tityos with her arrows for this act he was banished to tartarus and there he was pegged to the rock floor and stretched on an area of 9 while a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver or his heart another account recorded by strabo says that tityus was not a giant but a lawless man whom apollo killed at the request of the residents admetus admetus was the king of pherae who was known for his hospitality when apollo was exiled from olympus for killing python he served as a herdsman under admetus who was then young and unmarried apollo is said to have shared a romantic relationship with admetus during his stay after completing his years of servitude apollo went back to olympus as a god because admetus had treated apollo well the god conferred great benefits on him in return apollos mere presence is said to have made the cattle give birth to twins apollo helped admetus win the hand of alcestis the daughter of king pelias by taming a lion and a boar to draw admetus chariot he was present during their wedding to give his blessings when admetus angered the goddess artemis by forgetting to give her the due offerings apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister when apollo learnt of admetus untimely death he convinced or tricked the fates into letting admetus live past his time according to another version or perhaps some years later when zeus struck down apollos son asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead apollo in revenge killed the cyclopes who had fashioned the bolt for zeus apollo would have been banished to tartarus for this but his mother leto intervened and reminding zeus of their old love pleaded with him not to kill their son zeus obliged and sentenced apollo to one year of hard labor once again under admetus the love between apollo and admetus was a favored topic of roman poets like ovid and servius niobe the fate of niobe was prophesied by apollo while he was still in letos womb niobe was the queen of thebes and wife of amphion she displayed hubris when she boasted that she was superior to leto because she had fourteen children niobids seven male and seven female while leto had only two she further mocked apollos effeminate appearance and artemis manly appearance leto insulted by this told her children to punish niobe accordingly apollo killed niobes sons and artemis her daughters according to some versions of the myth among the niobids chloris and her brother amyclas were not killed because they prayed to leto amphion at the sight of his dead sons either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge a devastated niobe fled to mount sipylos in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept her tears formed the river achelous zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death when the gods themselves entombed them when chloris married and had children apollo granted her son nestor the years he had taken away from the niobids hence nestor was able to live for 3 generations building the walls of troy once apollo and poseidon served under the trojan king laomedon in accordance with zeus words apollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king disguised as humans in order to check his hubris apollo guarded the cattle of laomedon in the valleys of mount ida while poseidon built the walls of troy other versions make both apollo and poseidon the builders of the wall in ovids account apollo completes his task by playing his tunes on his lyre in pindars odes the gods took a mortal named aeacus as their assistant when the work was completed three snakes rushed against the wall and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by aeacus apollo immediately prophesied that troy would fall at the hands of aeacuss descendants the aeacidae ie his son telamon joined heracles when he sieged the city during laomedons rule later his greatgrandson neoptolemus was present in the wooden horse that leads to the downfall of troy however the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised but also threatened to bind their feet and hands and sell them as slaves angered by the unpaid labour and the insults apollo infected the city with a pestilence and poseidon sent the sea monster cetus to deliver the city from it laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter hesione who would later be saved by heracles during his stay in troy apollo had a lover named ourea who was a nymph and daughter of poseidon together they had a son named ileus whom apollo loved dearly trojan war apollo sided with the trojans during the trojan war waged by the greeks against the trojans during the war the greek king agamemnon captured chryseis the daughter of apollos priest chryses and refused to return her angered by this apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment he demanded that they return the girl and the achaeans greeks complied indirectly causing the anger of achilles which is the theme of the iliad receiving the aegis from zeus apollo entered the battlefield as per his fathers command causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry he pushed the greeks back and destroyed many of the soldiers he is described as the rouser of armies because he rallied the trojan army when they were falling apart when zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war apollo was provoked by poseidon to a duel however apollo declined to fight him saying that he would not fight his uncle for the sake of mortals when the greek hero diomedes injured the trojan hero aeneas aphrodite tried to rescue him but diomedes injured her as well apollo then enveloped aeneas in a cloud to protect him he repelled the attacks diomedes made on him and gave the hero a stern warning to abstain from attacking a god aeneas was then taken to pergamos a sacred spot in troy where he was healed after the death of sarpedon a son of zeus apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his fathers wish and cleaned it he then gave it to sleep hypnos and death thanatos apollo had also once convinced athena to stop the war for that day so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while the trojan hero hector who according to some was the gods own son by hecuba was favored by apollo when he got severely injured apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up his arms during a duel with achilles when hector was about to lose apollo hid hector in a cloud of mist to save him when the greek warrior patroclus tried to get into the fort of troy he was stopped by apollo encouraging hector to attack patroclus apollo stripped the armour of the greek warrior and broke his weapons patroclus was eventually killed by hector at last after hectors fated death apollo protected his corpse from achilles attempt to mutilate it by creating a magical cloud over the corpse shielding it from the rays of the sun apollo held a grudge against achilles throughout the war because achilles had murdered his son tenes before the war began and brutally assassinated his son troilus in his own temple not only did apollo save hector from achilles he also tricked achilles by disguising himself as a trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates he foiled achilles attempt to mutilate hectors dead body finally apollo caused achilles death by guiding an arrow shot by paris into achilles heel in some versions apollo himself killed achilles by taking the disguise of paris apollo helped many trojan warriors including agenor polydamas glaucus in the battlefield though he greatly favored the trojans apollo was bound to follow the orders of zeus and served his father loyally during the war nurturer of the young apollo kourotrophos is the god who nurtures and protects children and the young especially boys he oversees their education and their passage into adulthood education is said to have originated from apollo and the muses many myths have him train his children it was a custom for boys to cut and dedicate their long hair to apollo after reaching adulthood chiron the abandoned centaur was fostered by apollo who instructed him in medicine prophecy archery and more chiron would later become a great teacher himself asclepius in his childhood gained much knowledge pertaining to medicinal arts from his father however he was later entrusted to chiron for further education anius apollos son by rhoeo was abandoned by his mother soon after his birth apollo brought him up and educated him in mantic arts anius later became the priest of apollo and the king of delos iamus was the son of apollo and evadne when evadne went into labour apollo sent the moirai to assist his lover after the child was born apollo sent snakes to feed the child some honey when iamus reached the age of education apollo took him to olympia and taught him many arts including the ability to understand and explain the languages of birds idmon was educated by apollo to be a seer even though he foresaw his death that would happen in his journey with the argonauts he embraced his destiny and died a brave death to commemorate his sons bravery apollo commanded boeotians to build a town around the tomb of the hero and to honor him apollo adopted carnus the abandoned son of zeus and europa he reared the child with the help of his mother leto and educated him to be a seer when his son melaneus reached the age of marriage apollo asked the princess stratonice to be his sons bride and carried her away from her home when she agreed apollo saved a shepherd boy name unknown from death in a large deep cave by means of vultures to thank him the shepherd built apollo a temple under the name vulturius god of music immediately after his birth apollo demanded a lyre and invented the paean thus becoming the god of music as the divine singer he is the patron of poets singers and musicians the invention of string music is attributed to him plato said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music rhythm and harmony is the gift of apollo and the muses according to socrates ancient greeks believed that apollo is the god who directs the harmony and makes all things move together both for the gods and the humans for this reason he was called homopolon before the homo was replaced by a apollos harmonious music delivered people from their pain and hence like dionysus he is also called the liberator the swans which were considered to be the most musical among the birds were believed to be the singers of apollo they are apollos sacred birds and acted as his vehicle during his travel to hyperborea aelian says that when the singers would sing hymns to apollo the swans would join the chant in unison among the pythagoreans the study of mathematics and music were connected to the worship of apollo their principal deity their belief was that music purifies the soul just as medicine purifies the body they also believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the mechanics of the cosmos evolving into an idea known as the music of the spheres apollo appears as the companion of the muses and as musagetes leader of muses he leads them in dance they spend their time on parnassus which is one of their sacred places apollo is also the lover of the muses and by them he became the father of famous musicians like orpheus and linus apollo is often found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the lyre in his role as the god of banquets he was always present to play music at weddings of the gods like the marriage of eros and psyche peleus and thetis he is a frequent guest of the bacchanalia and many ancient ceramics depict him being at ease amidst the maenads and satyrs apollo also participated in musical contests when challenged by others he was the victor in all those contests but he tended to punish his opponents severely for their hubris apollos lyre the invention of the lyre is attributed either to hermes or to apollo himself distinctions have been made that hermes invented lyre made of tortoise shell whereas the lyre apollo invented was a regular lyre myths tell that the infant hermes stole a number of apollos cows and took them to a cave in the woods near pylos covering their tracks in the cave he found a tortoise and killed it then removed the insides he used one of the cows intestines and the tortoise shell and made his lyre upon discovering the theft apollo confronted hermes and asked him to return his cattle when hermes acted innocent apollo took the matter to zeus zeus having seen the events sided with apollo and ordered hermes to return the cattle hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented apollo fell in love with the instrument and offered to exchange the cattle for the lyre hence apollo then became the master of the lyre according to other versions apollo had invented the lyre himself whose strings he tore in repenting of the excess punishment he had given to marsyas hermes lyre therefore would be a reinvention contest with pan once pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo and to challenge the god of music to a contest the mountaingod tmolus was chosen to umpire pan blew on his pipes and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower midas who happened to be present then apollo struck the strings of his lyre it was so beautiful that tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo and everyone was pleased with the judgement only midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award apollo did not want to suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer and caused them to become the ears of a donkey contest with marsyas marsyas was a satyr who was punished by apollo for his hubris he had found an aulos on the ground tossed away after being invented by athena because it made her cheeks puffy athena had also placed a curse upon the instrument that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished when marsyas played the flute everyone became frenzied with joy this led marsyas to think that he was better than apollo and he challenged the god to a musical contest the contest was judged by the muses or the nymphs of nysa athena was also present to witness the contest marsyas taunted apollo for wearing his hair long for having a fair face and smooth body for his skill in so many arts he also further said the muses and athena sniggered at this comment the contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was that the victor could do whatever he wanted to the loser according to one account after the first round they both were deemed equal by the nysiads but in the next round apollo decided to play on his lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance marsyas argued against this saying that apollo would have an advantage and accused apollo of cheating but apollo replied that since marsyas played the flute which needed air blown from the throat it was similar to singing and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all the nymphs decided that apollos argument was just apollo then played his lyre and sang at the same time mesmerising the audience marsyas could not do this apollo was declared the winner and angered with marsyas haughtiness and his accusations decided to flay the satyr according to another account marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat out of shame he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack another variation is that apollo played his instrument upside down marsyas could not do this with his instrument so the muses who were the judges declared apollo the winner apollo hung marsyas from a tree to flay him apollo flayed the limbs of marsyas alive in a cave near celaenae in phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god he then gave the rest of his body for proper burial and nailed marsyas flayed skin to a nearby pinetree as a lesson to the others marsyas blood turned into the river marsyas but apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done he tore the strings of his lyre and threw it away the lyre was later discovered by the muses and apollos sons linus and orpheus the muses fixed the middle string linus the string struck with the forefinger and orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it they took it back to apollo but the god who had decided to stay away from music for a while laid away both the lyre and the pipes at delphi and joined cybele in her wanderings to as far as hyperborea contest with cinyras cinyras was a ruler of cyprus who was a friend of agamemnon cinyras promised to assist agamemnon in the trojan war but did not keep his promise agamemnon cursed cinyras he invoked apollo and asked the god to avenge the broken promise apollo then had a lyreplaying contest with cinyras and defeated him either cinyras committed suicide when he lost or was killed by apollo patron of sailors apollo functions as the patron and protector of sailors one of the duties he shares with poseidon in the myths he is seen helping heroes who pray to him for a safe journey when apollo spotted a ship of cretan sailors that were caught in a storm he quickly assumed the shape of a dolphin and guided their ship safely to delphi when the argonauts faced a terrible storm jason prayed to his patron apollo to help them apollo used his bow and golden arrow to shed light upon an island where the argonauts soon took shelter this island was renamed anaphe which means he revealed it apollo helped the greek hero diomedes to escape from a great tempest during his journey homeward as a token of gratitude diomedes built a temple in honor of apollo under the epithet epibaterius the embarker during the trojan war odysseus came to the trojan camp to return chriseis the daughter of apollos priest chryses and brought many offerings to apollo pleased with this apollo sent gentle breezes that helped odysseus return safely to the greek camp arion was a poet who was kidnapped by some sailors for the rich prizes he possessed arion requested them to let him sing for the last time to which the sailors consented arion began singing a song in praise of apollo seeking the gods help consequently numerous dolphins surrounded the ship and when arion jumped into the water the dolphins carried him away safely wars trojan war apollo played a pivotal role in the entire trojan war he sided with the trojans and sent a terrible plague to the greek camp which indirectly led to the conflict between achilles and agamemnon he killed the greek heroes patroclus achilles and numerous greek soldiers he also helped many trojan heroes the most important one being hector after the end of the war apollo and poseidon together cleaned the remains of the city and the camps telegony war a war broke out between the brygoi and the thesprotians who had the support of odysseus the gods athena and ares came to the battlefield and took sides athena helped the hero odysseus while ares fought alongside of the brygoi when odysseus lost athena and ares came into a direct duel to stop the battling gods and the terror created by their battle apollo intervened and stopped the duel between them indian war when zeus suggested that dionysus defeat the indians in order to earn a place among the gods dionysus declared war against the indians and travelled to india along with his army of bacchantes and satyrs among the warriors was aristaeus apollos son apollo armed his son with his own hands and gave him a bow and arrows and fitted a strong shield to his arm after zeus urged apollo to join the war he went to the battlefield seeing several of his nymphs and aristaeus drowning in a river he took them to safety and healed them he taught aristaeus more useful healing arts and sent him back to help the army of dionysus theban war during the war between the sons of oedipus apollo favored amphiaraus a seer and one of the leaders in the war though saddened that the seer was fated to be doomed in the war apollo made amphiaraus last hours glorious by lighting his shield and his helm with starry gleam when hypseus tried to kill the hero with a spear apollo directed the spear towards the charioteer of amphiaraus instead then apollo himself replaced the charioteer and took the reins in his hands he deflected many spears and arrows away from them he also killed many of the enemy warriors like melaneus antiphus aetion polites and lampus at last when the moment of departure came apollo expressed his grief with tears in his eyes and bid farewell to amphiaraus who was soon engulfed by the earth slaying of giants apollo killed the giants python and tityos who had assaulted his mother leto gigantomachy during the gigantomachy apollo and heracles blinded the giant ephialtes by shooting him in his eyes apollo shooting his left and heracles his right he also killed porphyrion the king of giants using his bow and arrows aloadae the aloadae namely otis and ephialtes were twin giants who decided to wage war upon the gods they attempted to storm mt olympus by piling up mountains and threatened to fill the sea with mountains and inundate dry land they even dared to seek the hand of hera and artemis in marriage angered by this apollo killed them by shooting them with arrows according to another tale apollo killed them by sending a deer between them as they tried to kill it with their javelins they accidentally stabbed each other and died phorbas phorbas was a savage giant king of phlegyas who was described as having swinelike features he wished to plunder delphi for its wealth he seized the roads to delphi and started harassing the pilgrims he captured the old people and children and sent them to his army to hold them for ransom and he challenged the young and sturdy men to a match of boxing only to cut their heads off when they would get defeated by him he hung the choppedoff heads to an oak tree finally apollo came to put an end to this cruelty he entered a boxing contest with phorbas and killed him with a single blow other stories in the first olympic games apollo defeated ares and became the victor in wrestling he outran hermes in the race and won first place apollo divides months into summer and winter he rides on the back of a swan to the land of the hyperboreans during the winter months and the absence of warmth in winter is due to his departure during his absence delphi was under the care of dionysus and no prophecies were given during winters periphas periphas was an attican king and a priest of apollo he was noble just and rich he did all his duties justly because of this people were very fond of him and started honouring him to the same extent as zeus at one point they worshipped periphas in place of zeus and set up shrines and temples for him this annoyed zeus who decided to annihilate the entire family of periphas but because he was a just king and a good devotee apollo intervened and requested his father to spare periphas zeus considered apollos words and agreed to let him live but he metamorphosed periphas into an eagle and made the eagle the king of birds when periphas wife requested zeus to let her stay with her husband zeus turned her into a vulture and fulfilled her wish molpadia and parthenos molpadia and parthenos were the sisters of rhoeo a former lover of apollo one day they were put in charge of watching their fathers ancestral wine jar but they fell asleep while performing this duty while they were asleep the wine jar was broken by the swine their family kept when the sisters woke up and saw what had happened they threw themselves off a cliff in fear of their fathers wrath apollo who was passing by caught them and carried them to two different cities in chersonesus molpadia to castabus and parthenos to bubastus he turned them into goddesses and they both received divine honors molpadias name was changed to hemithea upon her deification prometheus prometheus was the titan who was punished by zeus for stealing fire he was bound to a rock where each day an eagle was sent to eat prometheus liver which would then grow back overnight to be eaten again the next day seeing his plight apollo pleaded with zeus to release the kind titan while artemis and leto stood behind him with tears in their eyes zeus moved by apollos words and the tears of the goddesses finally sent heracles to free prometheus heracles after heracles then named alcides was struck with madness and killed his family he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of apollo apollo through the pythia commanded him to serve king eurystheus for twelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him only then would alcides be absolved of his sin apollo also renamed him heracles to complete his third task heracles had to capture the ceryneian hind a hind sacred to artemis and bring back it alive after chasing the hind for one year the animal eventually got tired and when it tried crossing the river ladon heracles captured it while he was taking it back he was confronted by apollo and artemis who were angered at heracles for this act however heracles soothed the goddess and explained his situation to her after much pleading artemis permitted him to take the hind and told him to return it later after he was freed from his servitude to eurystheus heracles fell in conflict with iphytus a prince of oechalia and murdered him soon after he contracted a terrible disease he consulted the oracle of apollo once again in the hope of ridding himself of the disease the pythia however denied to give any prophesy in anger heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started walking away intending to start his own oracle however apollo did not tolerate this and stopped heracles a duel ensued between them artemis rushed to support apollo while athena supported heracles soon zeus threw his thunderbolt between the fighting brothers and separated them he reprimanded heracles for this act of violation and asked apollo to give a solution to heracles apollo then ordered the hero to serve under omphale queen of lydia for one year in order to purify himself after their reconciliation apollo and heracles together founded the city of gythion platos concept of soulmates a long time ago there were three kinds of human beings male descended from the sun female descended from the earth and androgynous descended from the moon each human being was completely round with four arms and four legs two identical faces on opposite sides of a head with four ears and all else to match they were powerful and unruly otis and ephialtes even dared to scale mount olympus to check their insolence zeus devised a plan to humble them and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them he cut them all in two and asked apollo to make necessary repairs giving humans the individual shape they still have now apollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds he pulled together their skin at the abdomen and sewed the skin together at the middle of it this is what we call navel today he smoothened the wrinkles and shaped the chest but he made sure to leave a few wrinkles on the abdomen and around the navel so that they might be reminded of their punishment the rock of leukas leukatas was believed to be a whitecolored rock jutting out from the island of leukas into the sea it was present in the sanctuary of apollo leukates a leap from this rock was believed to have put an end to the longings of love once aphrodite fell deeply in love with adonis a young man of great beauty who was later accidentally killed by a boar heartbroken aphrodite wandered looking for the rock of leukas when she reached the sanctuary of apollo in argos she confided in him her love and sorrow apollo then brought her to the rock of leukas and asked her to throw herself from the top of the rock she did so and was freed from her love when she sought the reason behind this apollo told her that zeus before taking another lover would sit on this rock to free himself from his love for hera another tale relates that a man named nireus who fell in love with the cult statue of athena came to the rock and jumped in order to relieve himself after jumping he fell into the net of a fisherman in which when he was pulled out he found a box filled with gold he fought with the fisherman and took the gold but apollo appeared to him in the night in a dream and warned him not to appropriate gold which belonged to others it was an ancestral custom among the leukadians to fling a criminal from this rock every year at the sacrifice performed in honor of apollo for the sake of averting evil however a number of men would be stationed all around below rock to catch the criminal and take him out of the borders in order to exile him from the island this was the same rock from which according to a legend sappho took her suicidal leap slaying of titans once hera out of spite aroused the titans to war against zeus and take away his throne accordingly when the titans tried to climb mount olympus zeus with the help of apollo artemis and athena defeated them and cast them into tartarus female lovers love affairs ascribed to apollo are a late development in greek mythology their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the renaissance the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination daphne was a nymph who scorned apollos advances and ran away from him when apollo chased her in order to persuade her she changed herself into a laurel tree according to other versions she cried for help during the chase and gaia helped her by taking her in and placing a laurel tree in her place according to roman poet ovid the chase was brought about by cupid who hit apollo with a golden arrow of love and daphne with a leaden arrow of hatred the myth explains the origin of the laurel and the connection of apollo with the laurel and its leaves which his priestess employed at delphi the leaves became the symbol of victory and laurel wreaths were given to the victors of the pythian games apollo is said to have been the lover of all nine muses and not being able to choose one of them decided to remain unwed he fathered the corybantes by the muse thalia orpheus by calliope linus of thrace by calliope or urania and hymenaios hymen by one of the muses in the great eoiae

taken to lycia by apollo coronis was daughter of phlegyas king of the lapiths while pregnant with asclepius coronis fell in love with ischys son of elatus and slept with him when apollo found out

to the centaur chiron to raise dryope the daughter of dryops was impregnated by apollo in the form of a snake she gave birth to a son named amphissus in euripides play ion apollo fathered ion by creusa wife of xuthus he used his powers to conceal her pregnancy from her father later when creusa left ion to die in the wild apollo asked hermes to save the child and bring him to the oracle at delphi where he was raised by a priestess apollo loved and kidnapped an oceanid nymph melia her father oceanus sent one of his sons caanthus to find her but caanthus could not take her back from apollo so he burned apollos sanctuary in retaliation apollo shot and killed caanthus male lovers hyacinth or hyacinthus a beautiful and athletic spartan prince was one of apollos favourite lovers the pair was practicing throwing the discus when a discus thrown by apollo was blown off course by the jealous zephyrus and struck hyacinthus in the head killing him instantly apollo is said to be filled with grief out of hyacinthus blood apollo created a flower named after him as a memorial to his death and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection αἰαῖ meaning alas he was later resurrected and taken to heaven the festival hyacinthia was a national celebration of sparta which commemorated the death and rebirth of hyacinthus another male lover was cyparissus a descendant of heracles apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth cyparissus was so saddened by its death that he asked apollo to let his tears fall forever apollo granted the request by turning him into the cypress named after him which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk admetus the king of pherae was also apollos lover during his exile which lasted either for one year or nine years apollo served admetus as a herdsman the romantic nature of their relationship was first described by callimachus of alexandria who wrote that apollo was fired with love for admetus plutarch lists admetus as one of apollos lovers and says that apollo served admetus because he doted upon him latin poet ovid in his ars amatoria said that even though he was a god apollo forsook his pride and stayed in as a servant for the sake of admetus tibullus describes apollos love to the king as servitium amoris slavery of love and asserts that apollo became his servant not by force but by choice he would also make cheese and serve it to admetus his domestic actions caused embarrassment to his family when admetus wanted to marry princess alcestis apollo provided a chariot pulled by a lion and a boar he had tamed this satisfied alcestis father and he let admetus marry his daughter further apollo saved the king from artemis wrath and also convinced the moirai to postpone admetus death once branchus a shepherd one day came across apollo in the woods captivated by the gods beauty he kissed apollo apollo requited his affections and wanting to reward him bestowed prophetic skills on him his descendants the branchides were an influential clan of prophets other male lovers of apollo include children apollo sired many children from mortal women and nymphs as well as the goddesses his children grew up to be physicians musicians poets seers or archers many of his sons founded

including apollos sons apollo also fostered carnus the son of zeus and europa failed love attempts marpessa was kidnapped by idas but was loved by apollo as well zeus made her choose between them and she chose idas on the grounds that apollo being immortal would tire of her when she grew old sinope a nymph was approached by the amorous apollo she made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask for and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin apollo kept his promise and went back bolina was admired by apollo but she refused him and jumped into the sea to avoid her death apollo turned her into a nymph saving her life castalia was a nymph whom apollo loved she fled from him and dove into the spring at delphi at the base of mt parnassos which was then named after her water from this spring was sacred it was used to clean the delphian temples and inspire the priestesses cassandra was a daughter of hecuba and priam apollo wished to court her cassandra promised to return his love on one condition  he should give her the power to see the future apollo fulfilled her wish but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after angered that she broke her promise apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future no one would ever believe her prophecies the sibyl of cumae like cassandra promised apollo her love if he would give her a boon the sibyl took a handful of sand and asked apollo to grant her years of life as many as the grains of sand she held in her hands apollo granted her wish but sibyl went back on her word although sibyl did live an extended life as apollo had promised he did not give her agelessness along with it so she shrivelled and shrank and only her voice remained hestia the goddess of the hearth rejected both apollos and poseidons marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried in one version of the prophet tiresiass origins he was originally a woman who promised apollo to sleep with him if he would give her music lessons apollo gave her her wish but then she went back on her word and refused him apollo in anger turned her into a man female counterparts artemis artemis as the sister of apollo is thea apollousa that is she as a female divinity represented the same idea that apollo did as a male divinity in the prehellenic period their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described artemis as the wife of apollonovember 2021 however this relationship was never sexual but spiritual which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the hellenic periodjanuary 2022 artemis like her brother is armed with a bow and arrows she is the cause of sudden deaths of women she also is the protector of the young especially girls though she has nothing to do with oracles music or poetry she sometimes led the female chorus on olympus while apollo sang the laurel daphne was sacred to both artemis daphnaia had her temple among the lacedemonians at a place called hypsoi apollo daphnephoros had a temple in eretria a place where the citizens are to take the oaths in later times when apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or helios artemis was naturally regarded as selene or the moon hecate hecate the goddess of witchcraft and magic is the chthonic counterpart of apollo they both are cousins since their mothers  leto and asteria  are sisters one of apollos epithets hecatos is the masculine form of hecate and both names mean working from afar while apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darknessjanuary 2022 if hecate is the gatekeeper apollo agyieus is the doorkeeper hecate is the goddess of crossroads and apollo is the god and protector of streets the oldest evidence found for hecates worship is at apollos temple in miletos there hecate was taken to be apollos sister counterpart in the absence of artemis hecates lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrasts and complements at the same time apollos solar nature athena as a deity of knowledge and great power apollo was seen being the male counterpart of athena being zeus favorite children they were given more powers and duties apollo and athena often took up the role of protectors of cities and were patrons of some of the important cities athena was the principal goddess of athens apollo was the principal god of sparta as patrons of arts apollo and athena were companions of the muses the former a much more frequent companion than the latter apollo was sometimes called the son of athena and hephaestus in the trojan war as zeus executive apollo is seen holding the aegis like athena usually does apollos decisions were usually approved by his sister athena and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by zeus apollo in the oresteia in aeschylus oresteia trilogy clytemnestra kills her husband king agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter iphigenia to proceed forward with the trojan war apollo gives an order through the oracle at delphi that agamemnons son orestes is to kill clytemnestra and aegisthus her lover orestes and pylades carry out the revenge and consequently orestes is pursued by the erinyes or furies female personifications of vengeance apollo and the furies argue about whether the matricide was justified apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage they invade his temple and he drives them away he says that the matter should be brought before athena apollo promises to protect orestes as orestes has become apollos supplicant apollo advocates orestes at the trial and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo roman apollo the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks as a quintessentially greek god apollo had no direct roman equivalent although later roman poets often referred to him as phoebusjuly 2023 there was a tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of rome during the reign of tarquinius superbus on the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s bce apollos first temple at rome was established in the flaminian fields replacing an older cult site there known as the apollinare during the second punic war in 212 bce the ludi apollinares apollonian games were instituted in his honor on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one marcius in the time of augustus who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome after the battle of actium which was fought near a sanctuary of apollo augustus enlarged apollos temple dedicated a portion of the spoils to him and instituted quinquennial games in his honour he also erected a new temple to the god on the palatine hill sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to apollo and diana formed the culmination of the secular games held in 17 bce to celebrate the dawn of a new era festivals the chief apollonian festival was the pythian games held every four years at delphi and was one of the four great panhellenic games also of major importance was the delia held every four years on delos athenian annual festivals included the boedromia metageitnia pyanepsia and thargelia spartan annual festivals were the carneia and the hyacinthia thebes every nine years held the daphnephoria attributes and symbols apollos most common attributes were the bow and arrow other attributes of his included the kithara an advanced version of the common lyre the plectrum and the sword another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod representing his prophetic powers the pythian games were held in apollos honor every four years at delphi the bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games the palm tree was also sacred to apollo because he had been born under one in delos animals sacred to apollo included wolves dolphins roe deer swans cicadas symbolizing music and song ravens hawks crows apollo had hawks and crows as his messengers snakes referencing apollos function as the god of prophecy mice and griffins mythical eaglelion hybrids of eastern origin homer and porphyry wrote that apollo had a hawk as his messenger in many myths apollo is transformed into a hawk in addition claudius aelianus wrote that in ancient egypt people believed that hawks were sacred to the god and that according to the ministers of apollo in egypt there were certain men called hawkkeepers ἱερακοβοσκοί who fed and tended the hawks belonging to the god eusebius wrote that the second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of apollo in egypt and that the citys symbol is a man with a hawklike face horus claudius aelianus wrote that egyptians called apollo horus in their own language as god of colonization apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies especially during the height of colonization 750550 bce according to greek tradition he helped cretan or arcadian colonists found the city of troy however this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction hittite cuneiform texts mention an asia minor god called appaliunas or apalunas in connection with the city of wilusa attested in hittite inscriptions which is now generally regarded as being identical with the greek ilion by most scholars in this interpretation apollos title of lykegenes can simply be read as born in lycia which effectively severs the gods supposed link with wolves possibly a folk etymology in literary contexts apollo represents harmony order and reasoncharacteristics contrasted with those of dionysus god of wine who represents ecstasy and disorder the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian however the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary the two gods are brothers and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea he would leave the delphic oracle to dionysus this contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the borghese vase apollo is often associated with the golden mean this is the greek ideal of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony in antiquity apollo was associated with the planet mercury the ancient greeks believed that mercury as observed during the morning was a different planet than the one during the evening because each twilight mercury would appear farther from the sun as it set than it had the night before the morning planet was called apollo and the one at evening hermesmercury before they realised they were the same thereupon the name mercuryhermes was kept and apollo was dropped apollo in the arts apollo is a common theme in greek and roman art and also in the art of the renaissance the earliest greek word for a statue is delight ἄγαλμα agalma and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision maurice bowra notices that the greek artist puts into a god the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined the sculptors derived this from observations on human beings but they also embodied in concrete form issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body which was essentially a religious activity the muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the greek desire for health and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard greek environment the statues of apollo and the other gods present them in their full youth and strength in the balance and relation of their limbs such figures express their whole character mental and physical and reveal their central being  the radiant reality of youth in its heyday archaic sculpture numerous freestanding statues of male youths from archaic greece exist and were once thought to be representations of apollo though later discoveries indicated that many represented mortals in 1895 v i leonardos proposed the term kouros male youth to refer to those from keratea this usage was later expanded by henri lechat in 1904 to cover all statues of this format the earliest examples of lifesized statues of apollo may be two figures from the ionic sanctuary on the island of delos such statues were found across the greekspeaking world the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of apollo ptoios boeotia alone significantly more rare are the lifesized bronze statues one of the few originals which survived into the present dayso rare that its discovery in 1959 was described as a miracle by ernst homannwedekingis the masterpiece bronze piraeus apollo it was found in piraeus a port city close to athens and is believed to have come from northeastern peloponnesus it is the only surviving largescale peloponnesian statue classical sculpture the famous apollo of mantua and its variants are early forms of the apollo citharoedus statue type in which the god holds the cithara a sophisticated sevenstringed variant of the lyre in his left arm while none of the greek originals have survived several roman copies from approximately the late 1st or early 2nd century exist of which an example is the apollo barberini hellenistic greecerome apollo as a handsome beardless young man is often depicted with a cithara as apollo citharoedus or bow in his hand or reclining on a tree the apollo lykeios and apollo sauroctonos types the apollo belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century for centuries it epitomized the ideals of classical antiquity for europeans from the renaissance through the 19th century the marble is a hellenistic or roman copy of a bronze original by the greek sculptor leochares made between 330 and 320 bce the lifesize socalled adonis found in 1780 on the site of a villa suburbana near the via labicana in the roman suburb of centocelle is identified as an apollo by modern scholars in the late 2nd century ce floor mosaic from el djem roman thysdrus he is identifiable as apollo helios by his effulgent halo though now even a gods divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later empiremarch 2021 another haloed apollo in mosaic from hadrumentum is in the museum at sousse the conventions of this representation head tilted lips slightly parted largeeyed curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck were developed in the 3rd century bce to depict alexander the great some time after this mosaic was executed the earliest depictions of christ would also be beardless and haloed modern reception apollo often appears in modern and popular culture due to his status as the god of music dance and poetry postclassical art and literature dance and music apollo has featured in dance and music in modern culture percy bysshe shelley composed a hymn of apollo 1820 and the gods instruction of the muses formed the subject of igor stravinskys apollon musagète 19271928 in 1978 the canadian band rush released an album with songs apollo bringer of wisdomdionysus bringer of love books apollo has been portrayed in modern literature such as when charles handy in gods of management 1978 uses greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of organizational culture apollo represents a role culture where order reason and bureaucracy prevail in 2016 author rick riordan published the first book in the trials of apollo series publishing four other books in the series in 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 film apollo has been depicted in modern filmsfor instance by keith david in the 1997 animated feature film hercules by luke evans

arena game smite as a playable character psychology and philosophy in the philosophical discussion of the arts a distinction is sometimes made between the apollonian and dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity friedrich nietzsche argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable psychologist carl jungs apollo

benjamin becker of germany in four sets agassi received a fourminute standing ovation from the crowd after the match and delivered a retirement speech rivalries agassi vs sampras the rivalry has been called the greatest of the generation of players competing in the 1990s as sampras and agassi were the most successful players of that decade they also had very contrasting playing styles with sampras being considered the greatest server and agassi the greatest serve returner at the time agassi and sampras met 34 times on the tour level with agassi trailing 1420 the 1990 us open was their first meeting in a grand slam tournament final agassi was favored as he was ranked no 4 at the time compared to the no 12 ranking of sampras and because agassi had defeated sampras in their only previously completed match agassi however lost the final to sampras in straight sets their next meeting in a grand slam was at the 1992 french open where they met in the quarterfinals although sampras was ranked higher agassi came out winning in straight sets they met again on a grand slam level at the quarterfinals of wimbledon in 1993 where agassi was the defending champion and sampras was the newly minted world no 1 agassi dug himself out from a twosetstolove hole levelling the match at two sets apiece however sampras prevailed in five sets and went on to win his first wimbledon championship with both sampras and agassi participating the us won the davis cup in 1995 the year should be considered the peak of the rivalry as together they won three out of four major titles meeting each other twice in the finals and were occupying the top two spots in the rankings for the whole year they met five times during the year all in the title matches including the australian open the newsweek champions cup now indian wells the lipton international players championships now miami open the canadian open and the us open agassi won three of the finals including the australian open however sampras took the us open title ending agassis 26match winning streak after agassi had taken most of the fall season off sampras took over the no 1 ranking for the end of the season agassi admitted this loss which gave sampras a 98 lead in their headtohead meetings took two years for him to get over it mentally in the following three years while sampras continued winning grand slam titles every season agassi slumped in the rankings and struggled in major competitions the next time sampras and agassi met in a grand slam final was at wimbledon in 1999 where sampras won in straight sets for both it was considered a career rejuvenation as sampras had suffered a string of disappointments in the previous year while agassi was regaining his status as a topranked player after winning the french open sampras forfeited the no 1 ranking to agassi when injury forced him to withdraw from that years us open which agassi went on to win they faced each other twice in the seasonending atp tour world championships with sampras losing the roundrobin match but winning the final in the 2000s they met three more times on the grand slam level offering three memorable contests in 2000 the topranked agassi defeated no 3 sampras in the semifinals of the australian open in five sets which was an important win for agassi who had lost 4 of the previous five matches against sampras in arguably their most memorable match ever sampras defeated agassi in the 2001 us open quarterfinals in four sets there were no breaks of serve during the entire match reruns of the match are frequently featured on television especially during us open rain delays and the match is considered one of the best in history because of the level of play presented by both players their last meeting was the final of the 2002 us open which was their third meeting in a us open final but the first since 1995 the match was also notable because they had defeated several upandcoming players en route to the final sampras had defeated no 3 tommy haas in the fourth round and future no 1 andy roddick in the quarterfinals while agassi had defeated no 1 and defending champion lleyton hewitt in the semifinals sampras defeated agassi in four sets this was the final atp tour singles match of samprass career agassi vs chang michael chang was the opponent agassi faced most frequently from all the players other than sampras they met 22 times on the tour level with agassi leading 157 chang unlike most of agassis big rivals had a playing style similar to his both players preferred to stay at the baseline with chang being more defensiveminded the outcome was that most of their meetings were built on long and entertaining rallies the rivalry began late in the 1980s with both players being considered the prodigies of the next great generation of american tennis players and both being of foreign descent agassi won the first four matches including a straightset victory in round 16 of the 1988 us open and defeating chang the defending champion in the 1990 french open in a fourset quarterfinal arguably their best match took place in the round of 16 of the 1994 us open while both players presented highquality shotmaking the momentum changed from set to set with agassi eventually prevailing in a fiveset victory it turned out to be the toughest contest on his way to his first us open title their next two grand slam meetings came in 1996 with chang recording easy straightset victories in the semifinals of both the australian open and the us open years after agassi shockingly admitted in his book that he had lost the first of the matches on purpose as he did not want to face boris becker who was awaiting the winner in the final agassi won the last four of their matches with the last being in 2003 at the miami open with chang being clearly past his prime agassi vs becker boris becker and agassi played 14 times with agassi leading 104 becker won their first three matches in 1988 and 1989 before agassi reversed the rivalry in 1990 and won 10 of their last 11 matches one contributing factor is that after their third match agassi picked up a tell regarding beckers serve and knew where his serves would be directed they first played at indian wells in 1988 with becker prevailing their most notable match was the 1989 davis cup semifinal match which becker won in five sets after losing the first two in tiebreaks agassi considered a baseliner with a playing style not suiting grass shocked becker a threetime champion in a fiveset quarterfinal at wimbledon in 1992 on his way to his first grand slam title the intensity of the rivalry peaked in 1995 becker won that years wimbledon semifinal after being down a set and two breaks to eventually win in four sets in a highly anticipated rematch in the us open semifinal this time it was agassi who came out victorious in four tight sets their final match was played at hong kong in 1999 which agassi won in three sets agassi vs rafter agassi and pat rafter played fifteen times with agassi leading 105 the rivalry has been considered special and delivered memorable encounters because of the players contrasting styles of play with rafter using traditional servevolley methods against agassis variety of return of serves and passing shots as his main weapons agassi led 82 on hard courts but rafter surprisingly won their sole match on clay at the 1999 rome masters they played four matches at wimbledon with both winning two matches each agassi won the first two in 1993 and 1999 while rafter took their 2000 and 2001 encounters the latter two matches being gruelling 5setters often being presented on the lists of best matches ever played agassi also won both their meetings at the australian open in 1995 and 2001 on his way to the title on both occasions rafter however took their only us open encounter in 1997 and went on to win the title agassi vs federer agassi and roger federer played 11 times and federer led their headtohead series 83 with the retirement of sampras the rivalry against the 11yearsyounger federer who was another great server like sampras became agassis main rivalry for the final years of his career agassi won their first three matches but then went on to lose eight consecutive ones they first met in just the third tournament of federers career at the 1998 swiss indoors in federers hometown with agassi prevailing over the 17yearold agassi also defeated federer at the 2001 us open and the finals of the miami open in 2002 federer began to turn the tide at the masters cup in 2003 when he defeated agassi in both the roundrobin and the final they played a quarterfinal match at the 2004 us open that spanned over two windy days with federer eventually prevailing in five sets at the 2005 dubai

all sports at the time playing style early in his career agassi would look to end points quickly by playing firststrike tennis typically by inducing a weak return with a deep hard shot and then playing a winner at an extreme angle on the rare occasion that he charged the net agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for a winner his favored groundstroke was his flat accurate twohanded backhand hit well crosscourt but especially down the line his forehand was nearly as strong especially his insideout to the ad court agassis strength was in dictating play from the baseline and he was able to consistently take the ball on the rise while he was growing up his father and nick bollettieri trained him in this way when in control of a point agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors and to make his opponent run more this change to more methodical less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach brad gilbert in their first year together in 1994 gilbert encouraged agassi to wear out opponents with his deep flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars and noted agassis twohanded backhand down the line as his very best shot a signature play later in his career was a changeup drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes this would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it agassi was raised on hardcourts but found much of his early majortournament success

austroasiatic languages categories austroasiatic languages language families the austroasiatic languages ˌ oss are a large language family spoken throughout mainland southeast asia south asia and east asia these languages are natively spoken by the majority of the population in vietnam and cambodia and by minority populations scattered throughout parts of thailand laos india myanmar malaysia bangladesh nepal and southern china approximately 117 million people speak an austroasiatic language of which more than twothirds are vietnamese speakers of the austroasiatic languages only vietnamese khmer and mon have lengthy established presences in the historical record only two are presently considered to be the national languages of sovereign states vietnamese in vietnam and khmer in cambodia the mon language is a recognized indigenous language in myanmar and thailand while the wa language is a recognized national language in the de facto autonomous wa state within myanmar santali is one of the 22 scheduled languages of india the remainder of the familys languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status ethnologue identifies 168 austroasiatic languages these form thirteen established families plus perhaps shompen which is poorly attested as a fourteenth which have traditionally been grouped into two as monkhmer and munda however one recent classification posits three groups munda monkhmer and khasikhmuic while another has abandoned monkhmer as a taxon altogether making it synonymous with the larger family austroasiatic languages appear to be the extant autochthonous languages in mainland southeast asia with the neighboring kradai hmongmien austronesian and sinotibetan languages having arrived via later migrations etymology the name austroasiatic was coined by wilhelm schmidt austroasiatisch based on auster the latin word for south but idiosyncratically used by schmidt to refer to the southeast and asia despite the literal meaning of its name only three austroasiatic branches are actually spoken in south asia khasic munda and nicobarese typology regarding word structure austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic sesquisyllabic pattern with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial unstressed reduced minor syllable followed by a stressed full syllable this reduction of presyllables has led to a variety of phonological shapes of the same original protoaustroasiatic prefixes such as the causative prefix ranging from cvc syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants among the modern languages as for word formation most austroasiatic languages have a variety of derivational prefixes many have infixes but suffixes are almost completely nonexistent in most branches except munda and a few specialized exceptions in other austroasiatic branches the austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register contrast either between modal normal voice and breathy lax voice or between modal voice and creaky voice languages in the pearic branch and some in the vietic branch can have a three or even fourway voicing contrast however some austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases such as vietnamese tonogenesis vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by chinese that its original austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of south chinese languages whereas khmer which had more influence from sanskrit has retained a more typically austroasiatic structure protolanguage much work has been done on the reconstruction of protomonkhmer in harry l shortos monkhmer comparative dictionary little work has been done on the munda languages which are not well documented with their demotion from a primary branch protomonkhmer becomes synonymous with protoaustroasiatic paul sidwell 2005 reconstructs the consonant inventory of protomonkhmer as follows this is identical to earlier reconstructions except for ʄ ʄ is better preserved in the katuic languages which sidwell has specialized in internal classification linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of austroasiatic the monkhmer languages of southeast asia northeast india and the nicobar islands and the munda languages of east and central india and parts of bangladesh and nepal however no evidence for this classification has ever been published each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid cladefebruary 2016 by contrast the relationships between these families within austroasiatic are debated in addition to the traditional classification two recent proposals are given neither of which accepts traditional monkhmer as a valid unit however little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review in addition there are suggestions that additional branches of austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of acehnese in sumatra diffloth the chamic languages of vietnam and the land dayak languages of borneo adelaar 1995 diffloth 1974 diffloths widely cited original classification now abandoned by diffloth himself is used in encyclopædia britannica andexcept for the breakup of southern monkhmerin ethnologue peiros 2004 peiros is a lexicostatistic classification based on percentages of shared vocabulary this means that languages can appear to be more distantly related than they actually are due to language contact indeed when sidwell 2009 replicated peiross study with languages known well enough to account for loans he did not find the internal branching structure below diffloth 2005 diffloth compares reconstructions of various clades and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations though like other classifications the evidence has not been published as a schematic we have or in more detail sidwell 20092015 paul sidwell 2009 in a lexicostatistical comparison of 36 languages which are well known enough to exclude loanwords finds little evidence for internal branching though he did find an area of increased contact between the bahnaric and katuic languages such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant munda and nicobarese show greater similarity to bahnaric and katuic the closer they are to those branches without any noticeable innovations common to bahnaric and katuic he therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence sidwell  blench 2011 discuss this proposal in more detail and note that there is good evidence for a khasipalaungic node which could also possibly be closely related to khmuic if this would the case sidwell  blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had spread westward sidwell  blench 2011 suggest shompen as an additional branch and believe that a vietokatuic connection is worth investigating in general however the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed since protoaustroasiatic speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the central mekong river valley relatively quickly subsequently sidwell 2015a 179 proposed that nicobarese subgroups with aslian just as how khasian and palaungic subgroup with each other a subsequent computational phylogenetic analysis sidwell 2015b suggests that austroasiatic branches may have a loosely nested structure rather than a completely rakelike structure with an eastwest division consisting of munda khasic palaungic and khmuic forming a western group as opposed to all of the other branches occurring possibly as early as 7000 years before present however he still considers the subbranching dubious integrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent archaeological findings paul sidwell 2015c further expanded his mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into indochina from the lingnan area of southern china with the subsequent mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of neolithic farmers from southern china sidwell 2015c tentatively suggests that austroasiatic may have begun to split up 5000 years bp during the neolithic transition era of mainland southeast asia with all the major branches of austroasiatic formed by 4000 bp austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the pearl river watershed of lingnan which would have been either a coastal route down the coast of vietnam or downstream through the mekong river via yunnan both the reconstructed lexicon of protoaustroasiatic and the archaeological record clearly show that early austroasiatic speakers around 4000 bp cultivated rice and millet kept livestock such as dogs pigs and chickens and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments at 4500 bp this neolithic package suddenly arrived in indochina from the lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier preneolithic huntergatherer cultures with grain husks found in northern indochina by 4100 bp and in southern indochina by 3800 bp however sidwell 2015c found that iron is not reconstructable in protoaustroasiatic since each austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from tai chinese tibetan malay and other languages during the iron age about 2500 bp relatively young austroasiatic branches in indochina such as vietic katuic pearic and khmer were formed while the more internally diverse bahnaric branch dating to about 3000 bp underwent more extensive internal diversification by the iron age all of the austroasiatic branches were more or less in their presentday locations with most of the diversification within austroasiatic taking place during the iron age paul sidwell 2018 considers the austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around 4000 years bp during the arrival of rice agriculture in indochina but notes that the origin of protoaustroasiatic itself is older than that date the lexicon of protoaustroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum the early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts animal names natural features and pronouns while the names of cultural items agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts which are reconstructible in protoaustroasiatic form part of the later stratum roger blench 2017 suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies such as boats waterways river fauna and fish capture techniques can be reconstructed for protoaustroasiatic blench 2017 finds widespread austroasiatic roots for river valley boat fish catfish sp eel prawn shrimp central austroasiatic crab tortoise turtle otter crocodile heron fishing bird and fish trap archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern indochina northern vietnam laos and other nearby areas dates back to only about 4000 years ago 2000 bc with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the yangtze valley where it has been dated to 6000 bp sidwell 2022 proposes that the locus of protoaustroasiatic was in the red river delta area about 40004500 years before present instead of the middle mekong as he had previously proposed austroasiatic dispersed coastal maritime routes and also upstream through river valleys khmuic palaungic and khasic resulted from a westward dispersal that ultimately came from the red valley valley based on their current distributions about half of all austroasiatic branches including nicobaric and munda can be traced to coastal maritime dispersals hence this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of austroasiatic as compared to sinotibetan whose speakers had a distinct nonriverine culture in addition to living an aquaticbased lifestyle early austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock crops and newer types of watercraft as early austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area such as sinotibetan sidwell 2018 sidwell 2018 quoted in sidwell 2021 gives a more nested classification of austroasiatic branches as suggested by his computational phylogenetic analysis of austroasiatic languages using a 200word list many of the tentative groupings are likely linkages pakanic and shompen were not included possible extinct branches roger blench 2009 also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of austroasiatic that are now extinct based on substrate evidence in modernday languages other languages with proposed austroasiatic substrata are john peterson 2017 suggests that premunda proto in regular terminology languages may have once dominated the eastern indogangetic plain and were then absorbed by indoaryan languages at an early date as indoaryan spread east peterson notes that eastern indoaryan languages display many morphosyntactic features similar to those of munda languages while western indoaryan languages do not writing systems other than latinbased alphabets many austroasiatic languages are written with the khmer thai lao and burmese alphabets vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on chinese logographic writing this has since been supplanted by the latin alphabet in the 20th century the following are examples of pastused alphabets or current alphabets of austroasiatic languages external relations austric languages austroasiatic is an integral part of the controversial austric hypothesis which also includes the austronesian languages and in some proposals also the kradai languages and the hmongmien languages hmongmien several lexical resemblances are found between the hmongmien and austroasiatic language families ratliff 2010 some of which had earlier been proposed by haudricourt 1951 this could imply a relation or early language contact along the yangtze according to cai et al 2011 hmongmien people are genetically related to austroasiatic speakers and their languages were heavily influenced by sinotibetan especially tibetoburman languages indoaryan languages it is suggested that the austroasiatic languages have some influence on indoaryan languages including sanskrit and middle indoaryan languages indian linguist suniti kumar chatterji pointed that a specific number of substantives in languages such as hindi punjabi and bengali were borrowed from munda languages additionally french linguist jean przyluski suggested a similarity between the tales from the austroasiatic realm and the indian mythological stories of matsyagandha satyavati from mahabharata and the nāgas austroasiatic migrations and archaeogenetics mitsuru sakitani suggests that haplogroup o1b1 which is common in austroasiatic people and some other ethnic groups in southern china and haplogroup o1b2 which is common in todays japanese and koreans are the carriers of early rice agriculture from southern china another study suggests that the haplogroup o1b1 is the major austroasiatic paternal lineage and o1b2 the paraaustroasiatic lineage of the koreans and yayoi people a full genomic study by lipson et al 2018 identified a characteristic lineage that can be associated with the spread of austroasiatic languages in southeast asia and which can be traced back to remains of neolithic farmers from mán bạc 2000 bce in the red river delta in northern vietnam and to closely related ban chiang and vat komnou remains in thailand and cambodia respectively this austroasiatic lineage can be modeled as a sister group of the austronesian peoples with significant admixture ca 30 from a deeply diverging eastern eurasian source modeled by the authors as sharing some genetic drift with the onge a modern andamanese huntergatherer group and which is ancestral to modern austroasiaticspeaking groups of southeast asia such as the mlabri and the nicobarese and partially to the austroasiatic mundaspeaking groups of south asia eg the juang significant levels of austroasiatic ancestry were also found in austronesianspeaking groups of sumatra and borneo austroasiaticspeaking groups in southern china such as the wa and blang in yunnan predominatly carry the same mainland southeast asian neolithic farmer ancestry but with additional geneflow from northern and southern east asian lineages that can be associated with the spread of tibetoburman and kradai languages respectively migration into india according to chaubey et al austroasiatic speakers in india today are derived from dispersal from southeast asia followed by extensive sexspecific admixture with local indian populations according to riccio et al the munda peoples are likely descended from austroasiatic migrants from southeast asia according to zhang et al austroasiatic migrations from southeast asia into india took place after the last glacial maximum circa 10000 years ago arunkumar et al suggest austroasiatic migrations from southeast asia occurred into northeast india 52  06 kya and into east india 43  02 kya

ethnic groups in europe the afroasiatic languages or afroasiatic sometimes afrasian also known as hamitosemitic or semitohamitic are a language family or phylum of about 400 languages spoken predominantly in west asia north africa the horn of africa and parts of the sahara and sahel over 500 million people are native speakers of an afroasiatic language constituting the fourthlargest language family after indoeuropean sinotibetan and nigercongo most linguists divide the family into six branches berber chadic cushitic egyptian semitic and omotic the vast majority of afroasiatic languages are considered indigenous to the african continent including all those not belonging to the semitic branch arabic if counted as a single language is by far the most widely spoken within the family with around 300 million native speakers concentrated primarily in the middle east and north africa other major afroasiatic languages include the chadic hausa language with over 34 million native speakers the semitic amharic language with 25 million and the cushitic somali language with 15 million other afroasiatic languages with millions of native speakers include the cushitic sidaama language the semitic tigrinya language and the omotic wolaitta language though most languages within the family are much smaller in size there are many wellattested afroasiatic languages from antiquity that have since died or gone extinct including egyptian and the semitic languages akkadian biblical hebrew phoenician amorite and ugaritic there is no consensus among historical linguists as to precisely where or when the common ancestor of all afroasiatic languages known as protoafroasiatic was originally spoken however most agree that the afroasiatic homeland was located somewhere in northeastern africa with specific proposals including the horn of africa egypt the eastern sahara a significant minority of scholars argues for an origin in the levant the reconstructed timelines of when protoafroasiatic was spoken vary extensively with dates ranging from 18000 bc to 8000 bc even the latest plausible dating makes afroasiatic the oldest language family accepted by contemporary linguists comparative study of afroasiatic is hindered by the massive disparities in textual attestation between its branches while the semitic and egyptian branches are attested in writing as early as the fourth millennium bc berber cushitic and omotic languages were often not recorded until the 19th or 20th centuries while systematic sound laws have not yet been established to explain the relationships between the various branches of afroasiatic the languages share a number of common features one of the most important for establishing membership in the branch is a common set of pronouns other widely shared features include a prefix m which creates nouns from verbs evidence for alternations between the vowel a and a high vowel in the forms of the verb similar methods of marking gender and plurality and some details of phonology such as the presence of pharyngeal fricatives other features found in multiple branches include a specialized verb conjugation using suffixes egyptian semitic berber a specialized verb conjugation using prefixes semitic berber cushitic verbal prefixes deriving middle t causative s and passive m verb forms semitic berber egyptian cushitic and a suffix used to derive adjectives egyptian semitic name in current scholarship the most common names for the family are afroasiatic or afroasiatic hamitosemitic and semitohamitic other proposed names that have yet to find widespread acceptance include erythraicerythraean lisramic noahitic and lamekhite friedrich müller introduced the name hamitosemitic to describe the family in his grundriss der sprachwissenschaft 1876 the variant semitohamitic is mostly used in older russian sources the elements of the name were derived from the names of two sons of noah as attested in the book of genesiss table of nations passage semitic from the firstborn shem and hamitic from the secondborn ham genesis within the table of nations each of noahs sons is presented as the common progenitor of various people groups deemed to be closely related among others shem was the father of the jews assyrians and arameans while ham was the father of the egyptians and cushites this genealogy does not reflect the actual origins of these peoples languages for example the canaanites are descendants of ham according to the table even though hebrew is now classified as a canaanite language while the elamites are ascribed to shem despite their language being totally unrelated to hebrew the term semitic for the semitic languages had already been coined in 1781 by august ludwig von schlözer following an earlier suggestion by gottfried wilhelm leibniz in 1710 hamitic was first used by ernest renan in 1855 to refer to languages that appeared similar to the semitic languages but were not themselves provably a part of the family the belief in a connection between africans and the biblical ham which had existed at least as far back as isidore of seville in the 6th century ad led scholars in the early 19th century to speak vaguely of hamian or hamitish languages the term hamitosemitic has largely fallen out of favor among linguists writing in english but is still frequently used in the scholarship of various other languages such as german several issues with the label hamitosemitic have led many scholars to abandon the term and criticize its continued use one common objection is that the hamitic component inaccurately suggests that a monophyletic hamitic branch exists alongside semitic in addition joseph greenberg has argued that hamitic possesses racial connotations and that hamitosemitic overstates the centrality of the semitic languages within the family by contrast victor porkhomovsky suggests that the label is simply an inherited convention and doesnt imply a duality of semitic and hamitic any more than indoeuropean implies a duality of indic and european because of its use by several important scholars and in the titles of significant works of scholarship the total replacement of hamitosemitic is difficult while greenberg ultimately popularized the name afroasiatic in 1960 it appears to have been coined originally by maurice delafosse as french afroasiatique in 1914 the name refers to the fact that it is the only major language family with large populations in both africa and asia due to concerns that afroasiatic could imply the inclusion of all languages spoken across africa and asia the name afrasian yes was proposed by igor diakonoff in 1980 at present it predominantly sees use among russian scholars the names lisramicbased on the afroasiastic root lis tongue and the egyptian word rmṯ personand erythraeanreferring to the core area around which the languages are spoken the red seahave also been proposed distribution and branches scholars generally consider afroasiatic to have between five and eight branches the five that are universally agreed upon are berber also called libycoberber chadic cushitic egyptian and semitic most specialists consider the omotic languages to constitute a sixth branch due to the presumed distance of relationship between the various branches many scholars prefer to refer to afroasiatic as a linguistic phylum rather than a language family m victoria almansavillatoro and silvia štubňová nigrelli write that there are about 400 languages in afroasiatic ethnologue lists 375 languages many scholars estimate fewer languages exact numbers vary depending on the definitions of language and dialect berber the berber or libycoberber languages are spoken today by perhaps 16 million people they are often considered to constitute a single language with multiple dialects other scholars however argue that they are a group of around twelve languages about as different from each other as the romance or germanic languages in the past berber languages were spoken throughout north africa except in egypt since the 7th century ce however they have been heavily affected by arabic and have been replaced by it in many places there are two extinct languages potentially related to modern berber the first is the numidian language represented by over a thousand short inscriptions in the libycoberber alphabet found throughout north africa and dating from the 2nd century bce onward the second is the guanche language which was formerly spoken on the canary islands and went extinct in the 17th century ce the first longer written examples of modern berber varieties only date from the 16th or 17th centuries ce chadic chadic languages number between 150 and 190 making chadic the largest family in afroasiatic the chadic languages are typically divided into three major branches east chadic central chadic and west chadic most chadic languages are located in the chad basin with the exception of hausa hausa is the largest chadic language by native speakers and is spoken by a large number of people as a lingua franca in northern nigeria it may have as many as 80 to 100 million first and second language speakers eight other chadic languages have around 100000 speakers other chadic languages often have few speakers and may be endangered of going extinct only about 40 chadic languages have been fully described by linguists cushitic there are about 30 cushitic languages more if omotic is included spoken around the horn of africa and in sudan and tanzania the cushitic family is traditionally split into four branches the single language of beja c 3 million speakers the agaw languages eastern cushitic and southern cushitic only one cushitic language oromo has more than 25 million speakers other languages with more than a million speakers include somali sahoafar hadiyya and sidaama many cushitic languages have relatively few speakers cushitic does not appear to be related to the written ancient languages known from its area meroitic or old nubian the oldest text in a cushitic language probably dates from around 1770 written orthographies were only developed for a select number of cushitic languages in early 20th century egyptian the egyptian branch consists of a single language ancient egyptian which was historically spoken in the lower nile valley egyptian is first attested in writing around 3000 bce and finally went extinct around 1300 ce making it the language with the longest written history in the world egyptian is usually divided into two major periods earlier egyptian c 30001300 bce which is further subdivided into old egyptian and middle egyptian and later egyptian 1300 bce1300 ce which is further subdivided into late egyptian demotic and coptic coptic is the only stage written alphabetically to show vowels whereas egyptian was previously written in egyptian hieroglyphs which only represent consonants in the coptic period there is evidence for six major dialects which presumably existed previously but are obscured by precoptic writing additionally middle egyptian appears to be based on a different dialect than old egyptian which in turn shows dialectal similarities to late egyptian egyptian was replaced by arabic as the spoken language of egypt but coptic continues to be the liturgical language of the coptic orthodox church omotic the c 30 omotic languages are still mostly undescribed by linguists they are all spoken in southwest ethiopia except for the ganza language spoken in sudan omotic is typically split into north omotic or aroid and south omotic with the latter more influenced by the nilotic languages it is unclear whether the dizoid group of omotic languages belongs to the northern or southern group the two omotic languages with the most speakers are wolaitta and gamogofadawro with about 12 million speakers each a majority of specialists consider omotic to constitute a sixth branch of afroasiatic omotic was formerly considered part of the cushitic branch some scholars continue to consider it part of cushitic other scholars have questioned whether it is afroasiatic at all due its lack of several typical aspects of afroasiatic morphology semitic there are between 40 and 80 languages in the semitic family today semitic languages are spoken across north africa west asia and the horn of africa as well as on the island of malta making them the sole afroasiatic branch with members originating outside africa arabic spoken in both asia and africa is by far the most widely spoken afroasiatic language today with around 300 million native speakers while the ethiopian amharic has around 25 million most authorities divide semitic into two branches east semitic which includes the extinct akkadian language and west semitic which includes arabic aramaic the canaanite languages including hebrew as well as the ethiopian semitic languages such as geez and amharic the classification within west semitic remains contested the only group with an african origin is ethiopian semitic the oldest written attestations of semitic languages come from mesopotamia northern syria and egypt and date as early as c 3000 bce other proposed branches there there are also other proposed branches but none has so far convinced a majority of scholars further subdivisions there is no agreement on the relationships between and subgrouping of the different afroasiatic branches whereas marcel cohen 1947 claimed he saw no evidence for internal subgroupings numerous other scholars have made proposals with carsten peust counting 27 as of 2012 common trends in proposals as of 2019 include using common or lacking grammatical features to argue that omotic was the first language to branch off often followed by chadic in contrast to scholars who argue for an early split of chadic from afroasiatic scholars of the russian school tend to argue that chadic and egyptian are closely related and scholars who rely on percentage of shared lexicon often group chadic with berber three scholars who agree on an early split between omotic and the other subbranches but little else are harold fleming 1983 christopher ehret 1995 and lionel bender 1997 in contrast scholars relying on shared lexicon often produce a cushiticomotic group additionally the minority of scholars who favor an asian origin of afroasiatic tend to place semitic as the first branch to split off disagreement on which features are innovative and which are inherited from protoafroasiatic produces radically different trees as can be seen by comparing the trees produced by ehret and igor diakonoff responding to the above tom güldemann criticizes attempts at finding subgroupings based on common or lacking morphology by arguing that the presence or absence of morphological features is not a useful way of discerning subgroupings in afroasiatic because it can not be excluded that families currently lacking certain features did not have them in the past this also means that the presence of morphological features cannot be taken as defining a subgroup peust notes that other factors that can obscure genetic relationships between languages include the poor state of present documentation and understanding of particular language families historically with egyptian presently with omotic gene gragg likewise argues that more needs to be known about omotic still and that afroasiatic linguists have still not found convincing isoglosses on which to base genetic distinctions one way of avoiding the problem of determining which features are original and which are inherited is to use a computational methodology such as lexicostatistics with one of the earliest attempts being fleming 1983 this is also the method used by alexander militarev and sergei starostin to create a family tree fleming 2006 was a more recent attempt by fleming with a different result from militarev and starostin hezekiah bacovcin and david wilson argue that this methodology is invalid for discerning linguistic subrelationship they note the methods inability to detect various strong commonalities even between wellstudied branches of aa classification history a relationship between hebrew arabic and aramaic and the berber languages was perceived as early as the 9th century ce by the hebrew grammarian and physician judah ibn quraysh who is regarded as a forerunner of afroasiatic studies the french orientalist guillaume postel had also pointed out similarities between hebrew arabic and aramaic in 1538 and hiob ludolf noted similarities also to geez and amharic in 1701 this family was formally described and named semitic by august ludwig von schlözer in 1781 in 1844 theodor benfey first described the relationship between semitic and the egyptian language and connected both to the berber and the cushitic languages which he called ethiopic in the same year tn newman suggested a relationship between semitic and the hausa language an idea that was taken up by early scholars of afroasiatic in 1855 ernst renan named these languages related to semitic but not semitic hamitic in 1860 carl lottner proposed that they belonged to a single language family and in 1876 friedrich müller first described them as a hamitosemitic language family müller assumed that there existed a distinct hamitic branch of the family that consisted of egyptian berber and cushitic he did not include the chadic languages though contemporary egyptologist karl richard lepsius argued for the relation of hausa to the berber languages some scholars would continue to regard hausa as related to the other afroasiatic languages but the idea was controversial many scholars refused to admit that the largely unwritten negroid chadic languages were in the same family as the caucasian ancient civilizations of the egyptians and semites an important development in the history of afroasiatic scholarship  and the history of african linguistics  was the creation of the hamitic theory or hamitic hypothesis by lepsius fellow egyptologist christian bunsen and linguist christian bleek this theory connected the hamites the originators of hamitic languages with supposedly culturally superior caucasians who were assumed to have migrated into africa and intermixed with indigenous negroid africans in ancient times the hamitic theory would serve as the basis for carl meinhofs highly influential classification of african languages in his 1912 book die sprache der hamiten on one hand the hamitic classification was justified partially based on linguistic features for example meinhof split the presentlyunderstood chadic family into hamitochadic and an unrelated nonhamitic chadic based on which languages possessed grammatical gender on the other hand the classification also relied on nonlinguistic anthropological and culturally contingent features such as skin color hair type and lifestyle ultimately meinhofs classification of hamitic proved to include languages from every presentlyrecognized language family within africa the first scholar to question the existence of hamitic languages was marcel cohen in 1924 with skepticism also expressed by a klingenheben and dietrich westermann during the 1920s and 30s however meinhofs hamitic classification remained prevalent throughout the early 20th century until it was definitively disproven by joseph greenberg in the 1940s based on racial and anthropological data instead greenberg proposed an afroasiatic family consisting of five branches berber chadic cushitic egyptian and semitic reluctance among some scholars to recognize chadic as a branch of afroasiatic persisted as late as the 1980s in 1969 harold fleming proposed that a group of languages classified by greenberg as cushitic were in fact their own independent omotic brancha proposal that has been widely if not universally accepted these six branches now constitute an academic consensus on the genetic structure of the family greenberg relied on his own method of mass comparison of vocabulary items rather than the comparative method of demonstrating regular sound correspondences to establish the family an alternative classification based on the pronominal and conjugation systems was proposed by an tucker in 1967 as of 2023 widely accepted sound correspondences between the different branches have not yet been firmly established nevertheless morphological traits attributable to the protolanguage and the establishment of cognates throughout the family have confirmed its genetic validity origin timeline there is no consensus as to when protoafroasiatic was spoken the absolute latest date for when protoafroasiatic could have been extant is 4000 bce after which egyptian and the semitic languages are firmly attested however in all likelihood these languages began to diverge well before this hard boundary the estimations offered by scholars as to when protoafroasiatic was spoken vary widely ranging from 18000nbspbce to 8000nbspbce an estimate at the youngest end of this range still makes afroasiatic the oldest proven language family contrasting proposals of an early emergence tom güldemann has argued that less time may have been required for the divergence than is usually assumed as it is possible for a language to rapidly restructure due to areal contact with the evolution of chadic and likely also omotic serving as pertinent examples location likewise no consensus exists as to where protoafroasiatic originated scholars have proposed locations for the afroasiatic homeland across africa and west asia roger blench writes that the debate possesses a strong ideological flavor with associations between an asian origin and high civilization an additional complicating factor is the lack of agreement on the subgroupings of afroasiatic see further subdivisions  this makes associating archaeological evidence with the spread of afroasiatic particularly difficult nevertheless there is a longaccepted link between the speakers of protosouthern cushitic languages and the east african savanna pastoral neolithic 5000 years ago and archaeological evidence associates the protocushitic speakers with economic transformations in the sahara dating c 8500 ago as well as the speakers of the protozenati variety of the berber languages with an expansion across the maghreb in the 5th century ce an origin somewhere on the african continent has broad scholarly support and is seen as being wellsupported by the linguistic data most scholars more narrowly place the homeland near the geographic center of its present distribution in the southeastern sahara or adjacent horn of africa the afroasiatic languages spoken in africa are not more closely related to each other than they are to semitic as one would expect if only semitic had remained in an west asian homeland while all other branches had spread from there likewise all semitic languages are fairly similar to each other whereas the african branches of afroasiatic are very diverse this suggests the rapid spread of semitic out of africa proponents of an origin of afroasiatic within africa assume the protolanguage to have been spoken by preneolithic huntergatherers arguing that there is no evidence of words in protoafroasiatic related to agriculture or animal husbandry christopher ehret so y keita and paul newman also argue that archaeology does not indicate a spread of migrating farmers into africa but rather a gradual incorporation of animal husbandry into indigenous foraging cultures ehret in a separate publication argued that the two principles in linguistic approaches for determining the origin of languages which are the principles of fewest moves and greatest diversity had put beyond reasonable doubt that the language family had originated in the horn of africa a significant minority of scholars supports an asian origin of afroasiatic most of whom are specialists in semitic or egyptian studies the main proponent of an asian origin is the linguist alexander militarev who argues that protoafroasiatic was spoken by early agriculturalists in the levant and subsequently spread to africa militarev associates the speakers of protoafroasiatic with the levantine postnatufian culture arguing that the reconstructed lexicon of flora and fauna as well as farming and pastoralist vocabulary indicates that protoaa must have been spoken in this area scholar jared diamond and archaeologist peter bellwood have taken up militarevs arguments as part of their general argument that the spread of linguistic macrofamilies such as indoeuropean bantu and austroasiatic can be associated with the development of agriculture they argue that there is clear archaeological support for farming spreading from the levant into africa via the nile valley phonological characteristics afroasiatic languages share a number of phonetic and phonological features syllable structure egyptian cushitic berber omotic and most languages in the semitic branch all require a syllable to begin with a consonant with the exception of some grammatical prefixes igor diakonoff argues that this constraint goes back to protoafroasiatic some chadic languages allow a syllable to begin with a vowel however in many chadic languages verbs must begin with a consonant in cushitic and chadic languages a glottal stop or glottal fricative may be inserted to prevent a word from beginning with a vowel typically syllables only begin with a single consonant with the exception of some chadic languages all afroasiatic languages allow both closed and open syllables many chadic languages do not allow a syllable to end in a consonant most words end in a vowel in omotic and cushitic making syllablefinal consonant clusters rare diakonoff argues that protoafroasiatic syllables disallowed consonant clusters or vowels at the end of a syllable syllable weight plays an important role in aa especially in chadic it can affect the form of affixes attached to a word consonant systems several afroasiatic languages have large consonant inventories and it is likely that this is inherited from protoafroasiatic all afroasiatic languages contain stops and fricatives some branches have additional types of consonants such as affricates and lateral consonants aa languages tend to have pharyngeal fricative consonants with egyptian semitic berber and cushitic sharing ħ and ʕ in all aa languages consonants can be bilabial alveolar velar and glottal with additional places of articulation found in some branches or languages additionally the glottal stop ʔ usually exists as a phoneme and there tends to be no phonemic contrast between p and f or b and v in cushitic the ethiopian semitic language tigrinya and some chadic languages there is no underlying phoneme p at all most if not all branches of afroasiatic distinguish between voiceless voiced and emphatic consonants the emphatic consonants are typically formed deeper in the throat than the others they can be realized variously as glottalized pharyngealized uvularized ejective andor implosive consonants in the different branches it is generally agreed that only the obstruents had a contrast between voiceless and voiced forms in protoafroasiatic whereas continuants were voiceless a form of longdistance consonant assimilation known as consonant harmony is attested in berber chadic cushitic and semitic it usually affects features such as pharyngealization palatalization and labialization several omotic languages have sibilant harmony meaning that all sibilants s sh z ts etc in a word must match consonant incompatibility restrictions against the cooccurrence of certain usually similar consonants in verbal roots can be found in all afroasiatic branches though they are only weakly attested in chadic and omotic the most widespread constraint is against two different labial consonants other than w occurring together in a root a constraint which can be found in all branches but omotic another widespread constraint is against two nonidentical lateral obstruents which can be found in egyptian chadic semitic and probably cushitic such rules do not always apply for nouns numerals or denominal verbs and do not affect prefixes or suffixes added to the root roots that may have contained sequences that were possible in protoafroasiatic but are disallowed in the daughter languages are assumed to have undergone consonant dissimilation or assimilation a set of constraints developed originally by joseph greenberg on the basis of arabic has been claimed to be typical for afroasiatic languages greenberg divided semitic consonants into four types back consonants glottal pharyngeal uvular laryngeal and velar consonants front consonants dental or alveolar consonants liquid consonants and labial consonants he showed that generally any consonant from one of these groups could combine with consonants from any other group but could not be used together with consonants from the same group additionally he showed that protosemitic restricted a sequence of two identical consonants in the first and second position of the triliteral root these rules also have a number of exceptions similar exceptions can be demonstrated for the other aa branches that have these restrictions to their root formation james p allen has demonstrated that slightly different rules apply to egyptian for instance egyptian allows two identical consonants in some roots and disallows velars from occurring with pharyngeals vowel systems there is a large variety of vocalic systems in aa and attempts to reconstruct the vocalic system of protoafroasiatic vary considerably all branches of afroasiatic have a limited number of underlying vowels between two and seven but the number of phonetic vowels can be much larger the quality of the underlying vowels varies considerably by language the most common vowel throughout aa is schwa in the different languages central vowels are often inserted to break up consonant clusters a form of epenthesis various semitic cushitic berber and chadic languages including arabic amharic berber somali and east dangla also exhibit various types of vowel harmony tones the majority of aa languages are tonal languages phonemic tonality is found in omotic chadic and cushitic languages but absent in berber and semitic there is no information on whether egyptian had tones in contemporary omotic chadic and cushitic languages tone is primarily a grammatical feature it encodes various grammatical functions only differentiating lexical roots in a few cases in some chadic and some omotic languages every syllable has to have a tone whereas in most cushitic languages this is not the case some scholars postulate that protoafroasiatic may have had tone while others believe it arose later from a pitch accent similarities in grammar syntax and morphology at present there is no generally accepted reconstruction of protoafroasiatic grammar syntax or morphology nor one for any of the subbranches besides egyptian this means that it is difficult to know which features in afroasiatic languages are retentions and which are innovations moreover all afroasiatic languages have long been in contact with other language families and with each other leading to the possibility of widespread borrowing both within afroasiatic and from unrelated languages there are nevertheless a number of commonly observed features in afroasiatic morphology and derivation including the use of suffixes infixes vowel lengthening and shortening as a morphological change as well as the use of tone changes to indicate morphology further commonalities and differences are explored in more detail below general features consonantal root structures a widely attested feature in aa languages is a consonantal structure into which various vocalic templates are placed this structure is particularly visible in the verbs and is particularly noticeable in semitic besides for semitic vocalic templates are well attested for cushitic and berber where along with chadic it is less productive it is absent in omotic for egyptian evidence for the rootandtemplate structure exists from coptic in semitic egyptian berber verbs have no inherent vowels at all the vowels found in a given stem are dependent on the vocalic template in chadic verb stems can include an inherent vowel as well most semitic verbs are triliteral have three consonants whereas most chadic omotic and cushitic verbs are biliteral having two consonants the degree to which the protoaa verbal root was triliteral is debated it may have originally been mostly biconsonantal to which various affixes such as verbal extensions were then added and lexicalized although any root could theoretically be used to create a noun or a verb there is evidence for the existence of distinct noun and verb roots which behave in different ways as part of these templates the alternation apophony between high vowels eg i u and a low vowel a in verbal forms is usually described as one of the main characteristics of aa languages this change codes a variety of different functions it is unclear whether this system is a common aa trait the chadic examples for instance show signs of originally deriving from affixes which could explain the origins of the alterations in other languages as well word order it remains unclear what word order protoafroasiatic had berber egyptian and most semitic languages are verbinitial languages whereas cushitic omotic and some semitic subgroups are verbfinal languages protochadic is reconstructed as having verbinitial word order but most chadic languages have subjectverbobject word order reduplication and gemination afroasiatic languages use the processes of reduplication and gemination which often overlap in meaning to derive nouns verbs adjectives and adverbs throughout the aa language family gemination in particular is one of the typical features of aa full or partial reduplication of the verb is often used to derive forms showing repeated action pluractionality though it is unclear if this is an inherited feature or has been widely borrowed nouns grammatical gender and number the assignment of nouns and pronouns to either masculine or feminine gender is present in all branches  but not all languages  of the afroasiatic family this sexbased gender system is widely agreed to derive from protoafroasiatic in most branches gender is an inherent property of nouns additionally even when nouns are not cognates they tend to have the same gender throughout afroasiatic gender stability in egyptian semitic and berber a feminine suffix t is attested to mark feminine nouns in some cushitic and chadic languages a feminine t suffix or prefix lexicalized from a demonstrative is used to mark definiteness in addition to these uses t also functions as a diminutive pejorative andor singulative marker in some languages afroasiatic languages have a variety of ways of marking plurals in some branches nouns change gender from singular to plural gender polarity while in others plural forms are ungendered in addition to marking plurals via a number of affixes with the suffixes uuw and na widely attested several aa languages make use of internal vowel change apophony andor insertion epenthesis these socalled internal a or broken plurals are securely attested in semitic berber cushitic and chadic although it is unclear if the chadic examples are an independent development another common method of forming plurals is reduplication noun cases and states nouns cases are found in the semitic berber cushitic and omotic branches they are not found in chadic languages and there is no evidence for cases in egyptian a common pattern in aa languages with case is for the nominative to be marked by u or i and the accusative to be marked by a however the number and types of cases varies across aa and also within the individual branches some languages in aa have a marked nominative alignment a feature which may date back to protoafroasiatic zygmont frajzyngier states that a general characteristic of case marking in aa languages is that it tends to mark roles such as genitive dative locative etc rather than the subject and object a second category which partially overlaps with case is the aa linguistic category of state linguists use the term state to refer to different things in different languages in cushitic and semitic nouns exist in the free state or the construct state the construct state is a special usually reduced form of a noun which is used when the noun is possessed by another noun semitic or is modified by an adjective or relative clause cushitic edward lipiński refers to semitic nouns as having four states absolute freeindeterminate construct determinate and predicate coptic and egyptian grammar also refers to nouns having a free absolute state a construct state and a pronominal state the construct state is used when a noun becomes unstressed as the first element of a compound whereas the pronominal state is used when the noun has a suffixed possessive pronoun berber instead contrasts between the free state and the annexed state the latter of which is used for a variety of purposes including for subjects placed after a verb and after certain prepositions modifiers and agreement there is no strict distinction between adjectives nouns and adverbs in afroasaiatic all branches of afroasiatic have a lexical category of adjectives except for chadic some chadic languages do have adjectives however in berber languages adjectives are rare and are mostly replaced by nouns of quality and stative verbs in different languages adjectives and other modifiers must either precede or follow the noun in most aa languages numerals precede the noun in those languages that have adjectives they can take gender and number markings which in some cases agree with the gender and number of the noun they are modifying however in omotic adjectives do not agree with nouns sometimes they only but take gender and number marking only when they are used as nouns in other cases they take gender and number marking only when they follow the noun the noun then receives no marking a widespread pattern of gender and number marking in afroasiatic found on demonstratives articles adjectives and relative markers is a consonant n for masculine t for feminine and n for plural this can be found in semitic egyptian beja berber and chadic a system k masculine t feminine and h plural can be found in cushitic chadic with masculine k also appearing in omotic the feminine marker t is one of the most consistent aspects across the different branches of aa verb forms tenses aspects and moods tams there is no agreement about which tenses aspects or moods tams protoafroasiatic might have had most grammars of aa posit a distinction between perfective and imperfective verbal aspects which can be found in cushitic berber semitic most chadic languages and some omotic languages the egyptian verbal system diverges greatly from that found in the other branches additionally it is common in afroasiatic languages for the presentimperfective form to be a derived marked form of the verb whereas in most other languages and language families the present tense is the default form of the verb another common trait across the family is the use of a suppletive imperative for verbs of motion prefix conjugation conjugation of verbs using prefixes that mark person number and gender can be found in semitic berber and in cushitic where it is only found on a small set of frequent verbs these prefixes are clearly cognate across the branches although their use within the verbal systems of the individual languages varies there is a general pattern in which n is used for the first person plural whereas t is used for all forms of the second person regardless of plurality or gender as well as feminine singular prefixes of ʔ glottal stop for the first person singular and y for the third person masculine can also be reconstructed as there is no evidence for the prefix conjugation in omotic chadic or egyptian it is unclear whether this was a protoafroasiatic feature that has been lost in those branches or is a shared innovation among semitic berber and cushitic suffix conjugation some aa branches have what is called a suffix conjugation formed by adding pronominal suffixes to indicate person gender and number to a verbal adjective in akkadian egyptian berber and cushitic this forms a stative conjugation used to express the state or result of an action the same endings as in akkadian and egyptian are also present in the west semitic perfective verb form in akkadian and egyptian the suffixes appear to be reduced forms of the independent pronouns see pronouns the obvious correspondence between the endings in the two branches has been argued to show that egyptian and semitic are closely related while some scholars posit an aa origin for this form it is possible that the berber and cushitic forms are independent developments as they show significant differences from the egyptian and semitic forms the cushitic forms in particular may be derived from morphology found in subordinate clauses common derivational affixes mprefix noun derivation a prefix in m is the most widely attested affix in aa that is used to derive nouns and is one the features joseph greenberg used to diagnose membership in the family it forms agent nouns place nouns and instrument nouns in some branches it can also derive abstract nouns and participles omotic meanwhile shows evidence for a nonproductive prefix mv associated with the feminine gender christopher ehret has argued that this prefix is a later development that was not present in protoafroasiatic but rather derived from a paa indefinite pronoun m such an etymology is rejected by a zaborski and gábor takács the latter of whom argues for a paa ma that unites all or some of the meanings in the modern languages verbal extensions many aa languages use prefixes or suffixes verbal extensions to encode various pieces of information about the verb three derivational prefixes can be reconstructed for protoafroasiatic s causative t middle voice or reflexive and n passive the prefixes appear with various related meanings in the individual daughter languages and branches christopher ehret has proposed that protoafroasiatic originally had as many as thirtyseven separate verbal extensions many of which then became fossilized as third consonants this theory has been criticized by some such as andrzej zaborski and alan kaye as being too many extensions to be realistic though zygmont frajzyngier and erin shay note that some chadic languages have as many as twelve extensions nisba derivation the socalled nisba is a suffix used to derive adjectives from nouns and in egyptian also from prepositions it is found in egyptian semitic and possibly in some relic forms berber the suffix has the same basic form in egyptian and semitic taking the form iy in semitic and being written j in egyptian the semitic and cushitic genitive case in iii may be related to nisba adjective derivation due to its presence in the oldest attested and bestknown aa branches nisba derivation is often thought of as a quintessentially afroasiatic feature christopher ehret argues for its presence in protoafroasiatic and for its attestation in some form in all branches with a shape ay in addition to iy in some cases vocabulary comparison pronouns the forms of the pronouns are very stable throughout afroasiatic excluding omotic and they have been used as one of the chief tools for determining whether a language belongs to the family however there is no consensus on what the reconstructed set of afroasiatic pronouns might have looked like a common characteristic of aa languages is the existence of a special set of independent pronouns which are distinct from subject pronouns they can occur together with subject pronouns but cannot fulfill an object function also common are dependentaffix pronouns used for direct objects and to mark possession for most branches the first person pronouns contain a nasal consonant n m whereas the third person displays a sibilant consonant s sh other commonalities are masculine and feminine forms used in both the second and third persons except in cushitic and omotic these pronouns tend to show a masculine u and a feminine i the omotic forms of the personal pronouns differ from the others with only the plural forms in north omotic appearing potentially to be cognate numerals unlike in the indoeuropean or austronesian language families numerals in aa languages cannot be traced to a protosystem the cushitic and chadic numeral systems appear to have originally been base 5 the system in berber egyptian and semitic however has independent words for the numbers 69 thus it is possible that the numerals in egyptian berber and semitic are more closely related whereas the cushitic and chadic numerals are more closely related to each other modern chadic numeral systems are sometimes decimal having separate names for the numbers 110 and sometimes base5 deriving the numbers 69 from the numbers 15 in some way some families show more than one word for a numeral chadic semitic and berber each have two words for two and semitic has four words for one andrzej zaborski further notes that the numbers one two and five are particularly susceptible to replacement by new words with five often based on a word meaning hand another factor making comparisons of aa numeral systems difficult is the possibility of borrowing only some berber languages maintain the native berber numeral system with many using arabic loans for higher numbers and some from any numeral beyond two in some berber languages the roots for one and two are also borrowed from arabic some south cushitic numerals are borrowed from nilotic languages other cushitic numerals have been borrowed from ethiopian semitic languages cognates afroasiatic languages share a vocabulary of protoafroasiatic origin to varying extents writing in 2004 john huehnergard notes the great difficulty in establishing cognate sets across the family identifying cognates is difficult because the languages in question are often separated by thousands of years of development and many languages within the family have long been in contact with each other raising the possibility of loanwords work is also hampered because of the poor state of documentation of many languages there are two etymological dictionaries of afroasiatic one by christopher ehret and one by vladimir orel and olga stolbova both from 1995 both works provide highly divergent reconstructions and have been heavily criticized by other scholars andrzej zaborski refers to orel and stolbovas reconstructions as controversial and ehrets as not acceptable to many scholars tom güldemann argues that much comparative work in afroasiatic suffers from not attempting first to reconstruct smaller units within the individual branches but instead comparing words in the individual languages nevertheless both dictionaries agree on some items and some proposed cognates are uncontroversial such cognates tend to rely on relatively simple sound correspondences see also

state of the european union it has been a member of the united nations since 1993 etymology the origin of the word andorra is unknown although several hypotheses have been proposed the oldest is one put forward by the greek historian polybius the histories iii 35 1 who describes the andosins an iberian preroman tribe as historically located in the valleys of andorra and facing the carthaginian army in its passage through the pyrenees during the punic wars the word andosini or andosins ἀνδοσίνοι may derive from the basque handia meaning big or giant the andorran toponymy shows evidence of basque language in the area another theory suggests that the word andorra may derive from the old word anorra that contains the basque word ur water another theory suggests that andorra may derive from arabic ar الدارة indicating a vast land which is located among mountains or a thickly wooded place with ar being the definite article when the moors conquered the iberian peninsula the valleys of the high pyrenees were covered by large tracts of forest these regions were not administered by muslims because of the geographic difficulty of direct rule other theories suggest that the term derives from the navarroaragonese andurrial which means land covered with bushes or scrubland the folk etymology holds that charlemagne had named the region as a reference to the biblical canaanite valley of endor or andor where the midianites had been defeated a name bestowed by his heir and son louis the pious after defeating the moors in the wild valleys of hell history prehistory la balma de la margineda found by archaeologists at sant julià de lòria was settled in 9500 bce as a passing place between the two sides of the pyrenees the seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing by the groups of huntergatherers from ariege and segre during the neolithic a group of people moved to the valley of madriu the presentday natural park located in escaldesengordany declared unesco world heritage site as a permanent camp in 6640 bce the population of the valley grew cereals raised domestic livestock and developed commercial trade with people from the segre and occitania other archaeological deposits include the tombs of segudet ordino and feixa del moro sant julià de lòria both dated in 49004300 bce as an example of the urn culture in andorra the model of small settlements began to evolve to complex urbanism during the bronze age metallurgical items of iron ancient coins and reliquaries can be found in the ancient sanctuaries scattered around the country the sanctuary of roc de les bruixes stone of the witches is perhaps the most important archeological complex of this age in andorra located in the parish of canillo about the rituals of funerals ancient scripture and engraved stone murals iberian and roman andorra the inhabitants of the valleys were traditionally associated with the iberians and historically located in andorra as the iberian tribe andosins or andosini ἀνδοσίνους during the 7th and 2nd centuries bc influenced by the aquitanian basque and iberian languages the locals developed some current toponyms early writings and documents relating to this group of people goes back to the second century bc by the greek writer polybius in his histories during the punic wars some of the most significant remains of this era are the castle of the roc denclar part of the early marca hispanica lanxiu in les escaldes and roc de loral in encamp the presence of roman influence is recorded from the 2nd century bce to the 5th century ce the places with the most roman presence are in camp vermell red field in sant julià de lòria and in some places in encamp and in the roc denclar people continued trading mainly with wine and cereals with the roman cities of urgellet the presentday la seu durgell and across segre through the via romana strata ceretana also known as strata confluetana visigoths and carolingians the legend of charlemagne after the fall of the roman empire andorra came under the influence of the visigoths the kingdom of toledo and the diocese of urgell the visigoths remained in the valleys for 200 years during which time christianity spread when the muslim empire of alandalus replaced the ruling visigoths in most of the iberian peninsula andorra was sheltered from these arab invaders by the franks tradition holds that charles the great charlemagne granted a charter to the andorran people for a contingent of 5000 soldiers under the command of marc almugaver in return for fighting against the moors near portépuymorens cerdanya andorra remained part of the frankish marca hispanica the buffer zone between the frankish empire and the muslim territories andorra being part of the territory ruled by the count of urgell and eventually the bishop of the diocese of urgell tradition also holds that it was guaranteed by the son of charlemagne louis the pious writing the carta de poblament or a local municipal charter 805 in 988 count borrell ii of urgell gave the andorran valleys to the diocese of urgell in exchange for land in cerdanya since then the bishop of urgell based in seu durgell has been coprince of andorra the first document that mentions andorra as a territory is the acta de consagració i dotació de la catedral de la seu durgell deed of consecration and endowment of the

for two months under the command of renéjules baulardaugust 2020 the andorran police was reformed in the following year with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles the force consisted of six corporals one for each parish although there are currently seven parishes there were only six until 1978 plus four junior staff officers to coordinate action and a commander with the rank of major it was the responsibility of the six corporals each in his own parish to be able to raise a fighting force from among the ablebodied men of the parish the only permanent section of the presentday sometent is a twelveman ceremonial unit however all ablebodied men are technically available for military service with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm an area weapon such as a shotgun per household is unregulated however ranged weapons such as pistols and rifles require a license the army has not fought for more than 700 years and its main responsibility is to present the flag of andorra at official ceremonial functions according to marc forné molné andorras military budget is strictly from voluntary donations and the availability of fulltime volunteers in more recent

summer which can last until autumn may june and august are usually the rainiest months in winter however it is less rainy except in the highlands subject to the influence of fronts from the atlantic

categories means in mathematics and statistics the arithmetic mean pron arr arithmetic average or just the mean or average when the context is clear is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection the collection is often a set of results from an experiment an observational study or a survey the term arithmetic mean is preferred in some mathematics and statistics contexts because it helps distinguish it from other types of means such as geometric and harmonic in addition to mathematics and statistics the arithmetic mean is frequently used in economics anthropology history and almost every academic field to some extent for example per capita income is the arithmetic average income of a nations population while the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies it is not a robust statistic it is greatly influenced by outliers values much larger or smaller than most others for skewed distributions such as the distribution of income for which a few peoples incomes are substantially higher than most peoples the arithmetic mean may not coincide with ones notion of middle in that case robust statistics such as the median may provide a better description of central tendency definition for an explanation of the summation operator see summation motivating properties the arithmetic mean has several properties that make it interesting especially as a measure of central tendency these include additional properties contrast with median there are applications of this phenomenon in many fields for example since the 1980s the median income in the united states has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income generalizations weighted average continuous probability distributions if a numerical property and any sample of data from it can take on any value from a continuous range instead of for example just integers then the probability of a number falling into some range of possible values can be described by integrating a continuous probability distribution across this range even when the naive probability for a sample number taking one certain value from infinitely many is zero in this context the analog of a weighted average in which there are infinitely many possibilities for the precise value of the variable in each range is called the mean of the probability distribution the most widely encountered probability distribution is called the normal distribution it has the property that all measures of its central tendency including not just the mean but also the median mentioned above and the mode the three ms are equal this equality does not hold for other probability distributions as illustrated for the lognormal distribution here angles particular care is needed when using cyclic data such as phases or angles taking the arithmetic mean of 1 and 359 yields a result of 180 this is incorrect for two reasons in general application such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range a solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation that is define the mean as the central point the point about which one has the lowest dispersion and redefine the difference as a modular distance ie the distance on the circle so the modular distance between 1 and 359 is 2 not 358 symbols and encoding

football conference categories national football league american football league sports organizations established in 1970 the american football conference afc is one of the two conferences of the national football league nfl the highest professional level of american football in the united states the afc and its counterpart the national football conference nfc each contain 16 teams with 4 divisions both conferences were created as part of the 1970 merger between the national football league and the american football league afl all ten of the afl teams and three nfl teams became members of the new afc with the remaining thirteen nfl teams forming the nfc a series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger thus making the current total of 16 teams in each conference the current afc champions are the kansas city chiefs who defeated the baltimore ravens in the 2023 seasons afc championship game for their fourth conference championship and went on to win super bowl lviii against the san francisco 49ers teams like the nfc the conference has 16 teams organized into four divisions each with four teams east north south and west season structure currently the fourteen opponents each team faces over the 17game regular season schedule are set using a predetermined formula each afc team plays the other teams in their respective division twice home and away during the regular season in addition to eleven other games assigned to their schedule by the nfl three games are assigned on the basis of a particular teams final divisional standing from the previous season and the remaining eight games are split between the roster of two other nfl divisions this assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle using the 2023 regular season schedule as an example each team in the afc west plays against every team in the afc east and nfc north in this way nondivisional competition will be mostly among common opponents  the exception being the three games assigned based on the teams priorseason divisional standing at the end of each season the four division winners and three wild cards nondivision winners with best regular season record in the afc qualify for the playoffs the afc playoffs culminate in the afc championship game with the winner receiving the lamar hunt trophy the afc champion then plays the nfc champion in the super bowl history both the afc and the nfc were created after the nfl merged with the american football league afl in 1970 the afl began play in 1960 with eight teams and added two more expansion clubs the miami dolphins in 1966 and the cincinnati bengals in 1968 before the merger in order to equalize the number of teams in each conference three nfl teams that predated the afls launch the cleveland browns pittsburgh steelers and the thenbaltimore colts joined the ten former afl teams to form the afc the two afl divisions afl east and afl west were more or less intact while the nfls century division in which the browns and the steelers had played since 1967 was moved from the nfl to become the new afc central upon the completion of the merger of the afl and nfl in 1970 the newly minted american football conference had already agreed upon their divisional setup along mostly geographical lines for the 1970 season the national football conference however could not agree upon their setup and one was chosen from a fishbowl on january 16 1970 since the merger five expansion teams have joined the afc and two have left thus making the current total 16 when the seattle seahawks and the tampa bay buccaneers joined the league in 1976 they were temporarily placed in the nfc and afc respectively this arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences the seahawks eventually returned to the nfc as a result of the 2002 realignment the expansion jacksonville jaguars joined the afc in 1995 there have been five teams that have relocated at least once in 1984 the baltimore colts relocated to indianapolis in 1995 the cleveland browns had attempted to move to baltimore the resulting dispute between cleveland and the team led to modell establishing the baltimore ravens with the players and personnel from the browns while the browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the nfl the ravens were treated as an expansion team in california the oakland raiders relocated to los angeles in 1982 back to oakland in 1995 and then to las vegas in 2020 while the san diego chargers returned to los angeles in 2017 after 56 years in san diego the houston oilers moved to tennessee in 1997 where they were renamed the tennessee oilers the team would change its name again two years later to the tennessee titans the nfl would again expand in 2002 adding the houston texans to the afc with the exception of the aforementioned relocations since that time the divisional setup has remained static ever since between 1995 and 2022 the afc has sent only 9 of its 16 teams to the super bowl new england patriots 10 times pittsburgh steelers 4 times denver broncos 4 times baltimore ravens 2 times indianapolis colts 2 times kansas city chiefs 3 times cincinnati bengals 1 time las vegas raiders 1 time tennessee titans 1 time by contrast the nfc has sent 13 of the 16 nfc teams during that same time frame with only the detroit lions minnesota vikings and washington commanders missing out on an appearance in the super bowl 17 of the 19 afc champions from 2001 to 2019 have started one of just three quarterbacks  tom brady peyton manning and ben roethlisberger  in the super bowl the afc has started 7 quarterbacks in the last 20 super bowls while the nfc has started 16 logo the merged league created a new logo for the afc that took elements of the old afl logo specifically the a and the six stars surrounding it the nfc also adopted a logo in 1970 which like the afl and afc logos also contained only the first letter as opposed to a full abbreviation but with only three stars to represent the thenthree divisions of the conference the afc logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009 the 2010 nfl season introduced an updated afc logo with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars leaving four representing the four divisions of the afc and moving the stars inside the letter similar to the nfc logo which itself was updated at the same time to add a fourth star television nbc aired the afcs sunday afternoon and playoff games from 1970 through the 1997 season from 1998 to 2013 cbs was the primary broadcast rightsholder to the afc in those years all interconference games in which the afc team was the visiting team were broadcast on either nbc or cbs since 2014 the crossflex policy allows select afc games that involve them playing an nfc team at home or intraconference games to be moved from cbs to fox since 1990 select afc playoff games have been

political literature roman à clef novels satirical novels secker  warburg books animal farm is a beast fable in the form of a satirical allegorical novella by george orwell first published in england on 17 august 1945 it tells the story of a group of anthropomorphic farm animals who rebel against their human farmer hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal free and happy ultimately the rebellion is betrayed and under the dictatorship of a pig named napoleon the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before according to orwell animal farm reflects events leading up to the russian revolution of 1917 and then on into the stalinist era of the soviet union a period of time when russia lived under the communist ideology of joseph stalin orwell a democratic socialist was a critic of stalin and hostile to moscowdirected stalinism an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the barcelona may days conflicts between the poum and stalinist forces during the spanish civil war in a letter to yvonne davet orwell described animal farm as a satirical tale against stalin un conte satirique contre staline and in his essay why i write 1946 wrote animal farm was the first book in which i tried with full consciousness of what i was doing to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole the original title was animal farm a fairy story but us publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946 and only one of the translations during orwells lifetime the telugu version kept it other title variations include subtitles like a satire and a contemporary satire orwell suggested the title union des républiques socialistes animales for the french translation which abbreviates to ursa the latin word for bear a symbol of russia it also played on the french name of the soviet union union des républiques socialistes soviétiques orwell wrote the book between november 1943 and february 1944 when the united kingdom was in its wartime alliance with the soviet union against nazi germany and the british intelligentsia held stalin in high esteem a phenomenon orwell hated the manuscript was initially rejected by several british and american publishers including one of orwells own victor gollancz which delayed its publication it became a great commercial success when it did appear as international relations and public opinion were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the cold war time magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best englishlanguage novels 1923 to 2005 it also featured at number 31 on the modern library list of best 20thcentury novels and number 46 on the bbcs the big read poll it won a retrospective hugo award in 1996 and is included in the great books of the western world selection plot summary the animal populace of the poorly run manor farm near willingdon england is ripened for rebellion by neglect at the hands of the irresponsible and alcoholic farmer mr jones one night the exalted boar old major holds a conference at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called beasts of england when old major dies two young pigs snowball and napoleon assume command and stage a revolt driving mr jones off the farm and renaming the property animal farm they adopt the seven commandments of animalism the most important of which is all animals are equal the decree is painted in large letters on one side of the barn snowball teaches the animals to read and write while napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of animalism to commemorate the start of animal farm snowball raises a green flag with a white hoof and horn food is plentiful and the farm runs smoothly the pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items ostensibly for their health following an unsuccessful attempt by mr jones and his associates to retake the farm later dubbed the battle of the cowshed snowball announces his plans to modernise the farm by building a windmill napoleon disputes this idea and matters come to a head which culminates in napoleons dogs chasing snowball away and napoleon effectively declaring himself supreme commander napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm through a young porker named squealer napoleon claims credit for the idea of building the windmill claiming that snowball was only trying to win animals to his side the animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill when the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm napoleon and squealer persuade the animals that snowball is trying to sabotage their project and begin to purge the farm of animals accused by napoleon of consorting with his old rival when some animals recall the battle of the cowshed napoleon who was nowhere to be found during the battle gradually smears snowball to the point of saying he is a collaborator of mr jones even dismissing the fact that snowball was given an award of courage while falsely representing himself as the main hero of the battle beasts of england is replaced with animal farm while an anthem glorifying napoleon who is presumably adopting the lifestyle of a man comrade napoleon is composed and sung napoleon then conducts a second purge during which many animals who are alleged to be helping snowball in plots are executed by napoleons dogs which troubles the rest of the animals despite their hardships the animals are easily placated by napoleons retort that they are better off than they were under mr jones as well as by the sheeps continual bleating of four legs good two legs bad mr frederick a neighbouring farmer attacks the farm using blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill although the animals win the battle they do so at great cost as many including boxer the workhorse are wounded although he recovers from this boxer eventually collapses while working on the windmill being almost 12 years old at that point he is taken away in a knackers van and a donkey called benjamin alerts the animals of this but squealer quickly waves off their alarm by persuading the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital and that the previous owners signboard had not been repainted squealer subsequently reports boxers death and honours him with a festival the following day in truth napoleon had engineered the sale of boxer to the knacker allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves moreequalyears pass the windmill is rebuilt and another windmill is constructed which makes the farm a good amount of income however the ideals that snowball discussed including stalls with electric lighting heating and running water are forgotten with napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives snowball has been forgotten alongside boxer with the exception of the few who knew him many of the animals who participated in the rebellion are dead or old mr jones is also now known to be dead having died in an inebriates home in another part of the country the pigs start to resemble humans as they walk upright carry whips drink alcohol and wear clothes the seven commandments are abridged to just one phrase all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others the maxim four legs good two legs bad is similarly changed to four legs good two legs better other changes include the hoof and horn flag being replaced with a plain green banner and old majors skull which was previously put on display being reburied napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers with whom he celebrates a new alliance he abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name the manor farm the men and pigs start playing cards flattering and praising each other while cheating at the game both napoleon and mr pilkington one of the farmers play the ace of spades at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first when the animals outside look at the pigs and men they can no longer distinguish between the two characters pigs humans equines other animals genre and style george orwells animal farm is an example of a political satire and an allegory that was intended to have a wider application according to orwell himself in terms of its relevance stylistically the work shares many similarities with some of orwells other works most notably nineteen eightyfour as both have been considered works of swiftian satire furthermore these two prominent works seem to suggest orwells bleak view of the future for humanity he seems to stress the potentialcurrent threat of dystopias similar to those in animal farm and nineteen eightyfour in these kinds of works orwell distinctly references the disarray and traumatic conditions of europe following the second world war orwells style and writing philosophy as a whole were very concerned with the pursuit of truth in writing orwell was committed to communicating straightforwardly given the way that he felt words were commonly used in politics to deceive and confuse for this reason he is careful in animal farm to make sure the narrator speaks in an unbiased and uncomplicated fashion the difference is seen in the way that the animals speak and interact as the general moral animals seem to speak their minds clearly while the wicked animals on the farm such as napoleon twist language in such a way that it meets their insidious desires this style reflects orwells proximity to the issues facing europe at the time and his determination to comment critically on stalins soviet russia background origin and writing just as nineteen eightyfour would be inspired by yevgeny zamyatins we animal farm also had its influences in 1937 the year in which orwell said he first thought of animal farm gollanczs left book club published both the road to wigan pier and a leftwing childrens book the adventures of the little pig and other stories by f le gros and ida clark george orwell wrote the manuscript between november 1943 and february 1944 after his experiences during the spanish civil war which he described in homage to catalonia 1938 in the preface of a 1947 ukrainian edition of animal farm he explained how escaping the communist purges in spain taught him how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries this motivated orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals homage to catalonia sold poorly after seeing arthur koestlers bestselling darkness at noon about the moscow trials orwell decided that fiction would be the best way to describe totalitarianism immediately before writing the book orwell quit the bbc he was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the ministry of information had put out the booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the soviet union such as directions to claim that the red terror was a figment of nazi imagination in the preface orwell described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm in 1944 the manuscript was almost lost when a german v1 flying bomb destroyed his london home orwell spent hours sifting through the rubble to find the pages intact publication publishing orwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between britain the united states and the soviet union four publishers refused to publish animal farm yet one had initially accepted the work but declined it after consulting the ministry of information eventually secker and warburg published the first edition in 1945 during the second world war it became clear to orwell that antisoviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch  including his regular publisher gollancz he also submitted the manuscript to faber and faber where the poet t s eliot who was a director of the firm rejected it eliot wrote back to orwell praising the books good writing and fundamental integrity but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint which i take to be generally trotskyite eliot said he found the view not convincing and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm he posited that someone might argue what was needed  was not more communism but more publicspirited pigs orwell let andré deutsch who was working for nicholson  watson in 1944 read the typescript and deutsch was convinced that nicholson  watson would want to publish it however they did not and lectured orwell on what they perceived to be errors in animal farm in his london letter on 17 april 1944 for partisan review orwell wrote that it was now next door to impossible to get anything overtly antirussian printed antirussian books do appear but mostly from catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle the publisher jonathan cape who had initially accepted animal farm subsequently rejected the book after an official at the british ministry of information warned him off  although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a soviet spy writing to leonard moore a partner in the literary agency of christy  moore publisher jonathan cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the ministry of information such flagrant antisoviet bias was unacceptable and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive it may reasonably be assumed that the important official was a man named peter smollett who was later unmasked as a soviet agent orwell was suspicious of smollettsmolka and he would be one of the names orwell included in his list of cryptocommunists and fellowtravellers sent to the information research department in 1949 the publisher wrote to orwell saying frederic warburg also faced pressures against publication even from people in his own office and from his wife pamela who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards stalin and the red army which had played a major part in defeating adolf hitler a russian translation was printed in the paper posev and in permitting a russian translation of animal farm orwell refused in advance all royalties a translation in ukrainian which was produced in germany was confiscated in large part by the american wartime authorities and handed over to the soviet repatriation commission in october 1945 orwell wrote to frederic warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist david low might illustrate animal farm low had written a letter saying that he had had a good time with animal farm  an excellent bit of satire  it would illustrate perfectly nothing came of this and a trial issue produced by secker  warburg in 1956 illustrated by john driver was abandoned the folio society published an edition in 1984 illustrated by quentin blake and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist ralph steadman was published by secker  warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of animal farm preface orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about british selfcensorship and how the british people were suppressing criticism of the ussr their world war ii ally although the first edition allowed space for the preface in the authors proof it was not included and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute as of june 2009 most editions of the book have not included it in 1972 ian angus found the original typescript titled the freedom of the press and bernard crick published it together with his introduction in the times literary supplement on 15 september 1972 as how the essay came to be written orwells essay criticised british selfcensorship by the press specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of stalin and the soviet government the same essay also appeared in the italian 1976 edition of animal farm with another introduction by crick claiming to be the first edition with the preface other publishers were still declining to publish itmarch 2010 reception contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive writing in the american the new republic magazine george soule expressed his disappointment in the book writing that it puzzled and saddened me it seemed on the whole dull the allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their realworld inspirations and said it seems to me that the failure of this book commercially it is already assured of tremendous success arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well the guardian on 24 august 1945 called animal farm a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few tosco fyvel writing in tribune on the same day called the book a gentle satire on a certain state and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us julian symons responded on 7 september should we not expect in tribune at least acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular state  soviet russia it seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify napoleon with stalin and snowball with trotsky and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author upon a political ground in a hundred years perhaps animal farm may be simply a fairy story today it is a political satire with a good deal of point animal farm has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks between 1952 and 1957 the cia in an operation codenamed aedinosaur sent millions of balloons carrying copies of the novel into poland hungary and czechoslovakia whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down time magazine chose animal farm as one of the 100 best englishlanguage novels 1923 to 2005 it also featured at number 31 on the modern library list of best 20thcentury novels it won a retrospective hugo award in 1996 and is included in the great books of the western world selection popular reading in schools animal farm was ranked the uks favourite book from school in a 2016 poll animal farm has also faced an array of challenges in school settings around the us the following are examples of this controversy that has existed around orwells work animal farm has also faced similar forms of resistance in other countries the ala also mentions the way that the book was prevented from being featured at the international book fair in moscow russia in 1977 and banned from schools in the united arab emirates for references to practices or actions that defy arab or islamic beliefs such as pigs or alcohol in the same manner animal farm has also faced relatively recent issues in china in 2018 the government decided to censor all online posts about or referring to animal farm however the book itself as of 2019 remains sold in stores amy hawkins and jeffrey wasserstrom of the atlantic stated in 2019 that the book is widely available in mainland china for several reasons censors believe the general public is unlikely to read a highbrow book because the elites who do read books feel connected to the ruling party anyway and because the communist party sees being too aggressive in blocking cultural products as a liability the authors stated it was  and remains  as easy to buy 1984 and animal farm in shenzhen or shanghai as it is in london or los angeles an enhanced version of the book launched in india in 2017 was widely praised for capturing the authors intent by republishing the proposed preface of the first edition and the preface he wrote for the ukrainian edition analysis animalism snowball napoleon and squealer adapt old majors ideas into a complete system of thought which they formally name animalism an allegoric reference to communism not to be confused with the philosophy of animalism soon after napoleon and squealer partake in activities associated with the humans drinking alcohol sleeping in beds trading which were explicitly prohibited by the seven commandments squealer is employed to alter the seven commandments to account for this humanisation an allusion to the soviet governments revising of history to exercise control of the peoples beliefs about themselves and their society the original commandments are these commandments are also distilled into the maxim four legs good two legs bad which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of animalism later napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of lawbreaking the changed commandments are as follows with the changes bolded eventually these are replaced with the maxims all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others and four legs good two legs better as the pigs become more anthropomorphic this is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the seven commandments which was supposed to keep order within animal farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans evil habits through the revision of the commandments orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda significance and allegory orwell biographer jeffrey meyers has written virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory orwell himself wrote in 1946 of course i intended it primarily as a satire on the russian revolution  and that kind of revolution violent conspiratorial revolution led by unconsciously powerhungry people can only lead to a change of masters  revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert in a preface for a 1947 ukrainian edition he stated for the past ten years i have been convinced that the destruction of the soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement on my return from spain 1937 i thought of exposing the soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages the revolt of the animals against farmer jones is orwells analogy with the october 1917 bolshevik revolution the battle of the cowshed has been said to represent the allied invasion of soviet russia in 1918 and the defeat of the white russians in the russian civil war the pigs rise to preeminence mirrors the rise of a stalinist bureaucracy in the ussr just as napoleons emergence as the farms sole leader reflects stalins emergence the pigs appropriation of milk and apples for their own use the turning point of the story as orwell termed it in a letter to dwight macdonald stands as an analogy for the crushing of the leftwing 1921 kronstadt revolt against the bolsheviks and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various five year plans the puppies controlled by napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the stalinist structure and the pigs treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s in chapter seven when the animals confess their nonexistent crimes and are killed orwell directly alludes to the purges confessions and show trials of the late 1930s these contributed to orwells conviction that the bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the soviet system become rotten peter edgerly firchow and peter davison contend that the battle of the windmill specifically referencing the battle of stalingrad and the battle of moscow represents world war ii during the battle orwell first wrote all the animals including napoleon took cover orwell had the publisher alter this to all the animals except napoleon in recognition of stalins decision to remain in moscow during the german advance orwell requested the change after he met józef czapski in paris in march 1945 czapski a survivor of the katyn massacre and an opponent of the soviet regime told orwell as orwell wrote to arthur koestler that it had been the character and greatness of stalin that saved russia from the german invasion other connections that writers have suggested illustrate orwells telescoping of russian history from 1917 to 1943 including the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the rebellion which stands for the abortive revolutions in hungary and germany ch iv the conflict between napoleon and snowball ch v parallelling the two rival and quasimessianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another trotskyism with its faith in the revolutionary vocation of the proletariat of the west and stalinism with its glorification of russias socialist destiny napoleons dealings with whymper and the willingdon markets ch vi paralleling the treaty of rapallo and fredericks forged bank notes parallelling the hitlerstalin pact of august 1939 after which frederick attacks animal farm without warning and destroys the windmill the books close with the pigs and men in a kind of rapprochement reflected orwells view of the 1943 tehran conference that seemed to display the establishment of the best possible relations between the ussr and the west  but in reality were destined as orwell presciently predicted to continue to unravel the disagreement between the allies and the start of the cold war is suggested when napoleon and pilkington both suspicious each played an ace of spades simultaneously similarly the music in the novel starting with beasts of england and the later anthems parallels the internationale and its adoption and repudiation by the soviet authorities as the anthem of the ussr in the 1920s and 1930s according to masha gessen the metamorphosis of the eighth commandment some animals are more equal was likely inspired by similar change of a party line which declared all soviet people equal the russian nation and language suddenly became first among equals in official cpsu publications in 19361937 adaptations stage productions a theatrical version with music by richard peaslee and lyrics by adrian mitchell was staged at the national theatre london on 25 april 1984 directed by peter

radio dramatisations a bbc radio version produced by rayner heppenstall was broadcast in january 1947 orwell listened to the production at his home in canonbury square london with hugh gordon porteous

late devonian first appearances taxa named by john edward gray amphibians are ectothermic anamniotic fourlimbed vertebrate animals that constitute the class amphibia in its broadest sense it is a paraphyletic group encompassing all tetrapods excluding the amniotes tetrapods with an amniotic membrane such as modern reptiles birds and mammals all extant living amphibians belong to the monophyletic subclass lissamphibia with three living orders anura frogs urodela salamanders and gymnophiona caecilians evolved to be mostly semiaquatic amphibians have adapted to inhabit a wide variety of habitats with most species living in freshwater wetland or terrestrial ecosystems such as riparian woodland fossorial and even arboreal habitats their life cycle typically starts out as aquatic larvae with gills known as tadpoles but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this the young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult airbreathing form with lungs amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin they are superficially similar to reptiles like lizards but unlike reptiles and other amniotes require water bodies in which to breed with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often ecological indicators in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe the earliest amphibians evolved in the devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bonylimbed fins features that were helpful in adapting to dry land they diversified and became ecologically dominant during the carboniferous and permian periods but were later displaced in terrestrial environments by early reptiles and basal synapsids mammal predecessors the origin of modern amphibians belonging to lissamphibia which first appeared during the early triassic around 250 million years ago has long been contentious however the emerging consensus is that they likely originated from temnospondyls the most diverse group of prehistoric amphibians during the permian period a fourth group of lissamphibians the albanerpetontidae became extinct around 2 million years ago the number of known amphibian species is approximately 8000 of which nearly 90 are frogs the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is a frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis with a length of just 77 the largest living amphibian is the 18 south china giant salamander andrias sligoi but this is dwarfed by prehistoric temnospondyls such as mastodonsaurus which could reach up to 6 in length the study of amphibians is called batrachology while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology classification the word amphibian is derived from the ancient greek term ἀμφίβιος grc which means both kinds of life ἀμφί meaning of both kinds and βίος meaning life the term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water including seals and otters traditionally the class amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes amphibia in its widest sense sensu lato was divided into three subclasses two of which are extinct these three subclasses do not include all extinct amphibians other extinct amphibian groups include embolomeri late paleozoic large aquatic predators seymouriamorpha semiaquatic to terrestrial permian forms related to amniotes among others names such as tetrapoda and stegocephalia encompass the entirety of amphibiangrade tetrapods while reptiliomorpha or anthracosauria are variably used to describe extinct amphibians more closely related to amniotes than to lissamphibians the actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed the two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website amphibiaweb university of california berkeley and the classification by herpetologist darrel frost and the american museum of natural history available as the online reference database amphibian species of the world the numbers of species cited above follows frost and the total number of known living amphibian species as of march 31 2019 is exactly 8000 of which nearly 90 are frogs with the phylogenetic classification the taxon labyrinthodontia has been discarded as it is a polyparaphyletic group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a stembased or a nodebased classification traditionally amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians frogs salamanders and caecilians and all their descendants is called lissamphibia the phylogeny of paleozoic amphibians is uncertain and lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups like the temnospondyli traditionally placed in the subclass labyrinthodontia or the lepospondyli and in some analyses even in the amniotes this means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed a large number of basal devonian and carboniferous amphibiantype tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in amphibia in linnaean taxonomy and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy if the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in amphibia it becomes a paraphyletic group all modern amphibians are included in the subclass lissamphibia which is usually considered a clade a group of species that have evolved from a common ancestor the three modern orders are anura the frogs caudata or urodela the salamanders and gymnophiona or apoda the caecilians it has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from a temnospondyllike ancestor and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced reptiliomorph amphibians and thus of amniotes although the fossils of several older protofrogs with primitive characteristics are known the oldest true frog with hopping adaptations is prosalirus bitis from the early jurassic kayenta formation of arizona it is anatomically very similar to modern frogs the oldest known caecilians are funcusvermis gilmorei from the late triassic and eocaecilia micropodia from the early jurassic both from arizona the earliest salamander is beiyanerpeton jianpingensis from the late jurassic of northeastern china authorities disagree as to whether salientia is a superorder that includes the order anura or whether anura is a suborder of the order salientia the lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders but an extinct salamanderlike family the albanerpetontidae is now considered part of lissamphibia alongside the superorder salientia furthermore salientia includes all three recent orders plus the triassic protofrog triadobatrachus evolutionary history the first major groups of amphibians developed in the devonian period around 370 million years ago from lobefinned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish these ancient lobefinned fish had evolved multijointed leglike fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom some fish had developed primitive lungs that help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the devonian swamps were low in oxygen they could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required eventually their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods including modern amphibians reptiles birds and mammals despite being able to crawl on land many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water they had started to develop lungs but still breathed predominantly with gills many examples of species showing transitional features have been discovered ichthyostega was one of the first primitive amphibians with nostrils and more efficient lungs it had four sturdy limbs a neck a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobefinned fish eusthenopteron amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger better able to support the weight of their bodies on land they developed hands and feet with five or more digits the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation the fishs hyomandibula bone in the hyoid region behind the gills diminished in size and became the stapes of the amphibian ear an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land an affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the multifolded structure of the teeth and the paired supraoccipital bones at the back of the head neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom at the end of the devonian period 360 million years ago the seas rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates though some such as ichthyostega may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water it is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal in the early carboniferous 360 to 323 million years ago the climate was relatively wet and warm extensive swamps developed with mosses ferns horsetails and calamites airbreathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment there were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain with some occupying ecological positions currently held by crocodiles though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air most still had a long tapering body and strong tail others were the top land predators sometimes reaching several metres in length preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water they still needed to return to water to lay their shellless eggs and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors it was the development of the amniotic egg which prevents the developing embryo from drying out that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed after the carboniferous rainforest collapse amphibian dominance gave way to reptiles and amphibians were further devastated by the permiantriassic extinction event during the triassic period 252 to 201 million years ago the reptiles continued to outcompete the amphibians leading to a reduction in both the amphibians size and their importance in the biosphere according to the fossil record lissamphibia which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage may have branched off from the extinct groups temnospondyli and lepospondyli at some period between the late carboniferous and the early triassic the relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating but the most recent molecular study based on multilocus sequence typing suggests a late carboniferousearly permian origin for extant amphibians the origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate a 2005 molecular phylogeny based on rdna analysis suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs it also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the paleozoic or early mesozoic around 250 million years ago before the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobefinned fish the briefness of this period and the swiftness with which radiation took place would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils there are large gaps in the fossil record the discovery of the dissorophoid temnospondyl gerobatrachus from the early permian in texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs molecular analysis suggests that the frogsalamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the palaeontological evidence indicates one study suggested suggested that the last common ancestor of all modern amphibians lived about 315 million years ago and that stereospondyl temnospondyls are the closest relatives to the caecilians however most studies support a single monophyletic origin of all modern amphibians within the dissorophoid temnospondyls as they evolved from lunged fish amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land including the need to develop new means of locomotion in the water the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward but on land quite different mechanisms were required their vertebral columns limbs limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air they needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature they developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water the skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss characteristics the superclass tetrapoda is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs reptiles birds and mammals are amniotes the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes some of which are impervious lacking these membranes amphibians require water bodies for reproduction although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage they are not found in the sea with the exception of one or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps the andersons salamander meanwhile occurs in brackish or salt water lakes on land amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp modern amphibians have a simplified anatomy compared to their ancestors due to paedomorphosis caused by two evolutionary trends miniaturization and an unusually large genome which result in a slower growth and development rate compared to other vertebrates another reason for their size is associated with their rapid metamorphosis which seems to have evolved only in the ancestors of lissamphibia in all other known lines the development was much more gradual because a remodeling of the feeding apparatus means they do not eat during the metamorphosis the metamorphosis has to go faster the smaller the individual is so it happens at an early stage when the larvae are still small the largest species of salamanders do not go through a metamorphosis amphibians that lay eggs on land often go through the whole metamorphosis inside the egg an anamniotic terrestrial egg is less than 1 cm in diameter due to diffusion problems a size which puts a limit on the amount of posthatching growth the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is a microhylid frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis first discovered in 2012 it has an average length of 77 and is part of a genus that contains four of the worlds ten smallest frog species the largest living amphibian is the 18 chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus but this is a great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever existedthe extinct 9 prionosuchus a crocodilelike temnospondyl dating to 270 million years ago from the middle permian of brazil the largest frog is the african goliath frog conraua goliath which can reach 32 and weigh 3 amphibians are ectothermic coldblooded vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal physiological processes their metabolic rate is low and as a result their food and energy requirements are limited in the adult state they have tear ducts and movable eyelids and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations they have muscular tongues which in many species can be protruded modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae their skulls are mostly broad and short and are often incompletely ossified their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales apart from a few fishlike scales in certain caecilians the skin contains many mucous glands and in some species poison glands a type of granular gland the hearts of amphibians have three chambers two atria and one ventricle they have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin anura the order anura from the ancient greek an meaning without and oura meaning tail comprises the frogs and toads they usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them shorter forelimbs webbed toes with no claws no tails large eyes and glandular moist skin members of this order with smooth skins are commonly referred to as frogs while those with warty skins are known as toads the difference is not a formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule members of the family bufonidae are known as the true toads frogs range in size from the 30 goliath frog conraua goliath of west africa to the 77 paedophryne amauensis first described in papua new guinea in 2012 which is also the smallest known vertebrate although most species are associated with water and damp habitats some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts they are found worldwide except for polar areas anura is divided into three suborders that are broadly accepted by the scientific community but the relationships between some families remain unclear future molecular studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships the suborder archaeobatrachia contains four families of primitive frogs these are ascaphidae bombinatoridae discoglossidae and leiopelmatidae which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages the six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder mesobatrachia are the fossorial megophryidae pelobatidae pelodytidae scaphiopodidae and rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic pipidae these have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders neobatrachia is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs including most common species ninetysix percent of the over 5000 extant species of frog are neobatrachians caudata the order caudata from the latin cauda meaning tail consists of the salamanderselongated lowslung animals that mostly resemble lizards in form this is a symplesiomorphic trait and they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals salamanders lack claws have scalefree skins either smooth or covered with tubercles and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned they range in size from the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus which has been reported to grow to a length of 18 to the diminutive thorius pennatulus from mexico which seldom exceeds 20 in length salamanders have a mostly laurasian distribution being present in much of the holarctic region of the northern hemisphere the family plethodontidae is also found in central america and south america north of the amazon basin south america was apparently invaded from central america by about the start of the miocene 23 million years ago urodela is a name sometimes used for all the extant species of salamanders members of several salamander families have become paedomorphic and either fail to complete their metamorphosis or retain some larval characteristics as adults most salamanders are under 15 long they may be terrestrial or aquatic and many spend part of the year in each habitat when on land they mostly spend the day hidden under stones or logs or in dense vegetation emerging in the evening and night to forage for worms insects and other invertebrates the suborder cryptobranchoidea contains the primitive salamanders a number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found but there are only three living species the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus the japanese giant salamander andrias japonicus and the hellbender cryptobranchus alleganiensis from north america these large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded a unique feature is their ability to feed by suction depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right the males excavate nests persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them and guard them as well as breathing with lungs they respire through the many folds in their thin skin which has capillaries close to the surface the suborder salamandroidea contains the advanced salamanders they differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused prearticular bones in the lower jaw and by using internal fertilisation in salamandrids the male deposits a bundle of sperm the spermatophore and the female picks it up and inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid the largest family in this group is plethodontidae the lungless salamanders which includes 60 of all salamander species the family salamandridae includes the true salamanders and the name newt is given to members of its subfamily pleurodelinae the third suborder sirenoidea contains the four species of sirens which are in a single family sirenidae members of this order are eellike aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs some of their features are primitive while others are derived fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecae for sperm storage despite this the eggs are laid singly a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation gymnophiona the order gymnophiona from the greek gymnos meaning naked and ophis meaning serpent or apoda comprises the caecilians these are long cylindrical limbless animals with a snake or wormlike form the adults vary in length from 8 to 75 centimetres 3 to 30 inches with the exception of thomsons caecilian caecilia thompsoni which can reach 150 a caecilians skin has a large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales it has rudimentary eyes covered in skin which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity it also has a pair of short tentacles near the eye that can be extended and which have tactile and olfactory functions most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil in rotten wood and under plant debris but some are aquatic most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch they make their way to adjacent bodies of water others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch a few species give birth to live young nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct caecilians have a mostly gondwanan distribution being found in tropical regions of africa asia and central and south america anatomy and physiology skin the integumentary structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates such as the presence of highly cornified outer layers renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands local thickenings often called warts are common such as those found on toads the outside of the skin is shed periodically mostly in one piece in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes amphibians often eat the sloughed skin caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin the similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony deposits in the dermis but this is an example of convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages amphibian skin is permeable to water gas exchange can take place through the skin cutaneous respiration and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds to compensate for their thin and delicate skin amphibians have evolved mucous glands principally on their heads backs and tails the secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist in addition most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect the main poisonproducing glands the parotoids produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads along the backs of frogs behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians the skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores these three cell layers consist of the melanophores occupying the deepest layer the guanophores forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules producing a bluegreen colour and the lipophores yellow the most superficial layer the colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland unlike bony fish there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish a vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators skeletal system and locomotion amphibians have a skeletal system that is structurally homologous to other tetrapods though with a number of variations they all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs the bones are hollow and lightweight the musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body the bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes the pectoral girdle is supported by muscle and the welldeveloped pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs the ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals in most amphibians there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot but no claws on either some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eellike in appearance with tiny stubby legs the sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs the caecilians are limbless they burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body on the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side in frogs the hind legs are larger than the fore legs especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming in the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies the feet have adaptations for the way of life with webbing between the toes for swimming broad adhesive toe pads for climbing and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging frogs usually dig backwards into the soil in most salamanders the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop particularly when climbing in their normal gait only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors the lobefinned fish some salamanders in the genus aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs large toepads and prehensile tails in aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in a process known as autotomy certain species in the plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily the tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape both tails and limbs can be regenerated adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so circulatory system amphibians have a juvenile stage and an adult stage and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct in the juvenile or tadpole stage the circulation is similar to that of a fish the twochambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop in the adult stage amphibians especially frogs lose their gills and develop lungs they have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria when the ventricle starts contracting deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers nervous and sensory systems the nervous system is basically the same as in other vertebrates with a central brain a spinal cord and nerves throughout the body the amphibian brain is relatively simple but broadly the same structurally as in reptiles birds and mammals their brains are elongated except in caecilians and contain the usual motor and sensory areas of tetrapods the pineal body known to regulate sleep patterns in humans is thought to produce the hormones involved in hibernation and aestivation in amphibians tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians many aquatic salamanders and some caecilians possess electroreceptors called ampullary organs completely absent in anurans that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water the ears are well developed in frogs there is no external ear but the large circular eardrum lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye this vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone the stapes to the inner ear only highfrequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way but lowfrequency noises can be detected through another mechanism there is a patch of specialized haircells called papilla amphibiorum in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds another feature unique to frogs and salamanders is the columellaoperculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals the ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound the eyes of tadpoles lack lids but at metamorphosis the cornea becomes more domeshaped the lens becomes flatter and eyelids and associated glands and ducts develop the adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes they allow colour vision and depth of focus in the retinas are green rods which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths digestive and excretory systems many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs the short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage the enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey amphibians possess a pancreas liver and gall bladder the liver is usually large with two lobes its size is determined by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen in internal structures called fat bodies under the skin and in some salamanders in the tail there are two kidneys located dorsally near the roof of the body cavity their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine while terrestrial species with a greater need to conserve water excrete the less toxic product urea some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid urinary bladder respiratory system the lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes possessing few internal septa and large alveoli and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping most amphibians however are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin to enable sufficient cutaneous respiration the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration as in the titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander in air where oxygen is more concentrated some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange most famously the plethodontid salamanders which have neither lungs nor gills many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage with some such as the axolotl retaining gills as aquatic adults reproduction for the purpose of reproduction most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist a few eg fejervarya raja can inhabit brackish water but there are no true marine amphibians there are reports however of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters such was the case with the black sea invasion of the natural hybrid pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010 several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations eg eleutherodactylus the pacific platymantis the australopapuan microhylids and many other tropical frogs however do not need any water for breeding in the wild they reproduce via direct development an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from freestanding water almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult passing through the tadpole stage within the egg reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall but the seasonal timing in the tropics many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year in temperate regions breeding is mostly seasonal usually in the spring and is triggered by increasing day length rising temperatures or rainfall experiments have shown the importance of temperature but the trigger event especially in arid regions is often a storm in anurans males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active in caecilians fertilisation is internal the male extruding an intromittent organ the phallodeum and inserting it into the female cloaca the paired müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct the majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation in most of these the male deposits a spermatophore a small packet of sperm on top of a gelatinous cone on the substrate either on land or in the water the female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent the spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species in some the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus certain primitive salamanders in the families sirenidae hynobiidae and cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass with a few exceptions frogs use external fertilisation the male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs or in the case of epipedobates tricolor around the neck they remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm roughened nuptial pads on the males hands aid in retaining grip often the male collects and retains the egg mass forming a sort of basket with the hind feet an exception is the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously the tailed frog ascaphus truei exhibits internal fertilisation the tail is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female this frog lives in fastflowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs the sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the oviduct until the following spring most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders typically prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site the males usually arriving first calling and setting up territories other satellite males remain quietly nearby waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory the females arrive sporadically mate selection takes place and eggs are laid the females depart and territories may change hands more females appear and in due course the breeding season comes to an end explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall these frogs are typically fossorial species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site they are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season the assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females there is a direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts with elaborate courtship displays to keep the females attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to mate with some species store sperm through long breeding seasons as the extra time may allow for interactions with rival sperm life cycle most amphibians go through metamorphosis a process of significant morphological change after birth in typical amphibian development eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle frogs toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood which stimulates metamorphosis and prolactin which counteracts thyroxines effect specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues because most embryonic development is outside the parental body it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances for this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth whiskerlike skin extensions or fins they also make use of a sensory lateral line organ similar to that of fish after metamorphosis these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death called apoptosis the variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide with many discoveries still being made eggs in the egg the embryo is suspended in perivitelline fluid and surrounded by semipermeable gelatinous capsules with the yolk mass providing nutrients as the larvae hatch the capsules are dissolved by enzymes secreted from gland at the tip of the snout the eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae these penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis they seem to both speed up the development of the larvae and reduce mortality in the wood frog rana sylvatica the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to 6 warmer than its surroundings which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat the eggs may be deposited singly in cluster or in long strands sites for laying eggs include water mud burrows debris and on plants or under logs or stones the greenhouse frog eleutherodactylus planirostris lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage the tungara frog physalaemus pustulosus builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs first a raft is built then eggs are laid in the centre and finally a foam cap is overlaid the foam has antimicrobial properties it contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female larvae the eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into freeliving larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults in many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders plethodontidae direct development takes place the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies some caecilians the alpine salamander salamandra atra and some of the african livebearing toads nectophrynoides spp are viviparous their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the females oviduct often for long periods other amphibians but not caecilians are ovoviviparous the eggs are retained in or on the parents body but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult the larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth either before or after metamorphosis according to their species the toad genus nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members amphibian larvae are known as tadpoles they have thick rounded bodies with powerful muscular tails frogs unlike in other amphibians frog tadpoles do not resemble adults the freeliving larvae are normally fully aquatic but the tadpoles of some species such as nannophrys ceylonensis are semiterrestrial and live among wet rocks tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons gills for respiration external gills at first internal gills later lateral line systems and large tails that they use for swimming newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills these internal gills and operculum are not homologous with those of fish and are only found in tadpoles as both salamanders and caecilians have external gills only combined with buccal pumping the internal gills has allowed tadpoles to adopt a filter feeding lifestyle even if several species have since evolved other types of feeding strategies the lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs these larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place while tadpoles do not have true teeth in most species the jaws have long parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later iodine and t4 over stimulate the spectacular apoptosis cell death of the cells of the larval gills tail and fins also stimulate the evolution of nervous systems transforming the aquatic vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial carnivorous frog with better neurological visuospatial olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting in fact tadpoles developing in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous pond tadpoles tend to have deep bodies large caudal fins and small mouths they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths shallow bodies and caudal fins they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria they also feed on diatoms filtered from the water through the gills and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond ingesting edible fragments they have a relatively long spiralshaped gut to enable them to digest this diet some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage eating insects smaller tadpoles and fish young of the cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis can occasionally be cannibalistic the younger tadpoles attacking a larger more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis at metamorphosis rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely the spiralshaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut the animal develops a large jaw and its gills disappear along with its gill sac eyes and legs grow quickly and a tongue is formed there are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system all this can happen in about a day a few days later the tail is reabsorbed due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place salamanders at hatching a typical salamander larva has eyes without lids teeth in both upper and lower jaws three pairs of feathery external gills and a long tail with dorsal and ventral fins the forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pondliving species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water pondtype larvae often have a pair of balancers rodlike structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment both of these are able to breed some have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form a condition known as neoteny neoteny occurs when the animals growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine as well as lack of food there are fifteen species of obligate neotenic salamanders including species of necturus proteus and amphiuma and many examples of facultative ones such as the northwestern salamander ambystoma gracile and the tiger salamander a tigrinum that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances lungless salamanders in the family plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay a small number of unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander the female salamander often broods the eggs in the genus ensatinas the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion in newts and salamanders metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs this is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems their lungs are functional early but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins the closure of gill slits thickening of the skin the development of eyelids and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer and a land phase in winter for adaptation to a water phase prolactin is the required hormone and for adaptation to the land phase thyroxine external gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time caecilians most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water the development of the young of ichthyophis glutinosus a species from sri lanka has been much studied the eellike larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water they have three pairs of external red feathery gills a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes a lateral line system and a short tail with fins they swim by undulating their body from side to side they are mostly active at night soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land metamorphosis is gradual by the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes lateral line systems and tails the skin thickens embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments by this time the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land in the majority of species of caecilians the young are produced by viviparity typhlonectes compressicauda a species from south america is typical of these up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time they are elongated and have paired saclike gills small eyes and specialised scraping teeth at first they feed on the yolks of the eggs but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct this stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall they may increase their length sixfold and be twofifths as long as their mother before being born by this time they have undergone metamorphosis lost their eyes and gills developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles and reabsorbed their teeth a permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth gills are only necessarily during embryonic development and in species that give birth the offspring is born after gill degeneration in egg laying caecilians the gills are either reabsorbed before hatching or in species that hatch with gill remnants still present short lived and only leaves behind a gill slit for species with scales under their skin the scales does not form before during metamorphosis the ringed caecilian siphonops annulatus has developed a unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction the progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy the brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate meanwhile they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca parental care the care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but in general the larger the number of eggs in a batch the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place nevertheless it is estimated that in up to 20 of amphibian species one or both adults play some role in the care of the young those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land the black mountain salamander desmognathus welteri does this the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs when fully developed they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders the male hellbender a primitive salamander excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there the male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen the male colostethus subpunctatus a tiny frog protects the egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log when the eggs hatch the male transports the tadpoles on his back stuck there by a mucous secretion to a temporary pool where he dips himself into the water and the tadpoles drop off the male midwife toad alytes obstetricans winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks he keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles the female gastricbrooding frog rheobatrachus spp reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings however this stage was never observed before the species became extinct the tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply the pouched frog assa darlingtoni lays eggs on the ground when they hatch the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs the aquatic surinam toad pipa pipa raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family dendrobatidae its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable waterfilled crevice such as the axil of a leaf or the rosette of a bromeliad the female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles genetics and genomics amphibians are notable among vertebrates for their diversity of chromosomes and genomes the karyotypes chromosomes have been determined for at least 1193 145 of the 8200 known diploid species including 963 anurans 209 salamanders and 21 caecilians generally the karyotypes of diploid amphibians are characterized by 2026 biarmed chromosomes amphibians have also very large genomes compared to other taxa of vertebrates and corresponding variation in genome size cvalue picograms of dna in haploid nuclei the genome sizes range from 095 to 115 pg in frogs from 1389 to 12056 pg in salamanders and from 294 to 1178 pg in caecilians the large genome sizes have prevented wholegenome sequencing of amphibians although a number of genomes have been published recently the 17gb draft genome of xenopus tropicalis was the first to be reported for amphibians in 2010 compared to some salamanders this frog genome is tiny for instance the genome of the mexican axolotl turned out to be 32 gb which is more than 10 times larger than the human genome 3gb feeding and diet with a few exceptions adult amphibians are predators feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow the diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles caterpillars earthworms and spiders the sirens siren spp often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and a brazilian tree frog xenohyla truncata includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet the mexican burrowing toad rhinophrynus dorsalis has a specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites it projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first their tongues being hinged at the front food is mostly selected by sight even in conditions of dim light movement of the prey triggers a feeding response frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs rana clamitans have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past toads salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey this response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves cavedwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell even in complete darkness amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it they typically have small hinged pedicellate teeth a feature unique to amphibians the base and crown of these are composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals salamanders caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws but some frogs rana spp lack teeth in the lower jaw and toads bufo spp have no teeth in many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates others amphibians such as the bufo spp toads actively search for prey while the argentine horned frog ceratophrys ornata lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes among leaf litter frogs in panama frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim often brightly coloured and toxic while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and wellcamouflaged caecilians do not flick their tongues but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backwardpointing teeth the struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow the subdued prey is gulped down whole when they are newly hatched frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg when this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria algal crusts detritus and raspings from submerged plants water is drawn in through their mouths which are usually at the bottom of their heads and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth they scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths some such as the spadefoot toads have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic vocalization the calls made by caecilians and salamanders are limited to occasional soft squeaks grunts or hisses and have not been much studied a clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation as in bats or a form of communication most salamanders are considered voiceless but the california giant salamander dicamptodon ensatus has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked frogs are much more vocal especially during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates the presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself in most species the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth this may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere or the water at times when the animal is submerged the main vocalisation is the males loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory this call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus when a frog is attacked a distress or fright call is emitted often resembling a scream the usually nocturnal cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours territorial behaviour little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges these are usually feeding breeding or sheltering sites males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species females and even juveniles are also involved although in many frog species females are larger than males this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest arms or thumbs in salamanders defence of a territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder this may involve snapping chasing and sometimes biting occasionally causing the loss of a tail the behaviour of red back salamanders plethodon cinereus has been much studied 91 of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within a metre yard of their original daytime retreat under a log or rock a similar proportion when moved experimentally a distance of 30 found their way back to their home base the salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged 016 in size and were sometimes inhabited by a male and female pair these deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals an aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively if the intruder persisted a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the nasolabial grooves damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food in frogs male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates in general a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires there is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders holders of territories have a home advantage and usually come off better in an encounter between two similarsized frogs if threats are insufficient chest to chest tussles may take place fighting methods include pushing and shoving deflating the opponents vocal sac seizing him by the head jumping on his back biting chasing splashing and ducking him under the water defence mechanisms amphibians have soft bodies with thin skins and lack claws defensive armour or spines nevertheless they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive the first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce this keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip the secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow african clawed frogs xenopus laevis which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape caecilians have been little studied in this respect but the cayenne caecilian typhlonectes compressicauda produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in brazil in some salamanders the skin is poisonous the roughskinned newt taricha granulosa from north america and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin ttx the most toxic nonprotein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish handling the newts does not cause harm but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly in feeding trials fish frogs reptiles birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible the only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis in locations where both snake and salamander coexist the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities at the same rate as the snake further develops its immunity some frogs and toads are toxic the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back these regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foultasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms altogether over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity these warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black with the fire salamander salamandra salamandra being an example once a predator has sampled one of these it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal in some species such as the firebellied toad bombina spp the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked exhibiting their bright colours to the predator the frog allobates zaparo is not poisonous but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality a strategy that may deceive predators many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight other amphibians use camouflage to avoid being detected they have various colourings such as mottled browns greys and olives to blend into the background some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the north american northern shorttailed shrew blarina brevicauda their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which makes it difficult for the predator to avoid contact with their poisonproducing granular glands a few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape the tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached the tail is regenerated later but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant some frogs and toads inflate themselves to make themselves look large and fierce and some spadefoot toads pelobates spp scream and leap towards the attacker giant salamanders of the genus andrias as well as ceratophrine and pyxicephalus frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with a defensive bite the blackbelly salamander desmognathus quadramaculatus can bite an attacking common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis two or three times its size on the head and often manages to escape cognition in amphibians there is evidence of habituation associative learning through both classical and instrumental learning and discrimination abilities amphibians are widely considered to be sentient able to feel emotions such as anxiety and fear in one experiment when offered live fruit flies drosophila virilis salamanders chose the larger of 1 vs 2 and 2 vs 3 frogs can distinguish between low numbers 1 vs 2 2 vs 3 but not 3 vs 4 and large numbers 3 vs 6 4 vs 8 but not 4 vs 6 of prey this is irrespective of other characteristics ie surface area volume weight and movement although discrimination among large numbers may be based on surface area conservation dramatic declines in amphibian populations including population crashes and mass localized extinction have been noted since the late 1980s from locations all over the world and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity in 2004 the international union for conservation of nature iucn reported stating that currently birds mammals and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum 48 times greater than natural extinction ratespossibly 1024 times higher in 2006 there were believed to be 4035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle of these 1356 336 were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status a number of causes are believed to be involved including habitat destruction and modification overexploitation pollution introduced species global warming endocrinedisrupting pollutants destruction of the ozone layer ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin eyes and eggs of amphibians and diseases like chytridiomycosis however many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood and are a topic of ongoing discussion food webs and predation any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation the loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline the western terrestrial garter snake thamnophis elegans in california is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers the yosemite toad bufo canorus and the mountain yellowlegged frog rana muscosa putting the snakes future at risk if the snake were to become scarce this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it meanwhile in the ponds and lakes fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles these normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom a reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences pollution and pesticides the decline in amphibian and reptile populations has led to an awareness of the effects of pesticides on reptiles and amphibians in the past the argument that amphibians or reptiles were more susceptible to any chemical contamination than any land aquatic vertebrate was not supported by research until recently amphibians and reptiles have complex life cycles live in different climate and ecological zones and are more vulnerable to chemical exposure certain pesticides such as organophosphates neonicotinoids and carbamates react via cholinesterase inhibition cholinesterase is an enzyme that causes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine an excitatory neurotransmitter that is abundant in the nervous system ache inhibitors are either reversible or irreversible and carbamates are safer than organophosphorus insecticides which are more likely to cause cholinergic poisoning reptile exposure to an ache inhibitory pesticide may result in disruption of neural function in reptiles the buildup of these inhibitory effects on motor performance such as food consumption and other activities conservation and protection strategies the amphibian specialist group of the iucn is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation amphibian ark is an organization that was formed to implement the exsitu conservation recommendations of this plan and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians one such project is the panama amphibian rescue and conservation project that built on existing conservation efforts in panama to create a countrywide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis another measure would be to stop exploitation of frogs for human consumption in the middle east a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was already linked to an increase in mosquitoes and thus has direct consequences for human health see

the us on january 3 1959 abundant natural resources have enabled alaskawith one of the smallest state economiesto have one of the highest per capita incomes with commercial fishing and the extraction of natural gas and oil dominating alaskas economy us armed forces bases and tourism also contribute to the economy more than half the state is federallyowned land containing national forests national parks and wildlife refuges it is among the most irreligious states one of the first to legalize recreational marijuana and is known for its libertarianleaning political culture generally supporting the republican party in national elections the indigenous population of alaska is proportionally the second highest of any us state at over 15 percent after only hawaii etymology the name alaska alyaska was introduced in the russian colonial period when it was used to refer to the alaska peninsula it was derived from an aleutlanguage idiom alaxsxaq meaning the mainland or more literally the object towards which the action of the sea is directed history precolonization alaska nativesnumerous indigenous peoples occupied alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of european peoples to the area linguistic and dna studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of north america by way of the bering land bridge at the upward sun river site in the tanana valley in alaska remains of a sixweekold infant were found the babys dna showed that she belonged to a population that was genetically separate from other native groups present elsewhere in the new world at the end of the pleistocene ben potter the university of alaska fairbanks archaeologist who unearthed the remains at the upward sun river site in 2013 named this new group ancient beringians the tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today southeast alaska along with parts of british columbia and the yukon also in southeast were the haida now well known for their unique arts the tsimshian people came to alaska from british columbia in 1887 when president grover cleveland and later the us congress granted them permission to settle on annette island and found the town of metlakatla all three of these peoples as well as other indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid19th century with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s resulting in high fatalities and social disruption colonization some researchers believe the first russian settlement in alaska was established in the 17th century according to this hypothesis in 1648 several koches of semyon dezhnyovs expedition came ashore in alaska by storm and founded this settlement this hypothesis is based on the testimony of chukchi geographer nikolai daurkin who had visited alaska in 17641765 and who had reported on a village on the kheuveren river populated by bearded men who pray to the icons some modern researchers associate kheuveren with koyuk river the first european vessel to reach alaska is generally held to be the st gabriel under the authority of the surveyor m s gvozdev and assistant navigator i fyodorov on august 21 1732 during an expedition of siberian cossack a f shestakov and russian explorer dmitry pavlutsky 17291735 another european contact with alaska occurred in 1741 when vitus bering led an expedition for the russian navy aboard the st peter after his crew returned to russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of siberia toward the aleutian islands the first permanent european settlement was founded in 1784 between 1774 and 1800 spain sent several expeditions to alaska to assert its claim over the pacific northwest in 1789 a spanish settlement and fort were built in nootka sound these expeditions gave names to places such as valdez bucareli sound and cordova later the russianamerican company carried out an expanded colonization program during the earlytomid19th century sitka renamed new archangel from 1804 to 1867 on baranof island in the alexander archipelago in what is now southeast alaska became the capital of russian america it remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the united states the russians never fully colonized alaska and the colony was never very profitable evidence of russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeastern alaska william h seward the 24th united states secretary of state negotiated the alaska purchase referred to pejoratively as sewards folly with the russians in 1867 for 72 million russias contemporary ruler tsar alexander ii the emperor of the russian empire king of poland and grand duke of finland also planned the sale the purchase was made on march 30 1867 six months later the commissioners arrived in sitka and the formal transfer was arranged the formal flagraising took place at fort sitka on october 18 1867 in the ceremony 250 uniformed us soldiers marched to the governors house at castle hill where the russian troops lowered the russian flag and the us flag was raised this event is celebrated as alaska day a legal holiday on october 18 alaska was loosely governed by the military initially and was administered as a district starting in 1884 with a governor appointed by the united states president a federal district court was headquartered in sitka for most of alaskas first decade under the united states flag sitka was the only community inhabited by american settlers they organized a provisional city government which was alaskas first municipal government but not in a legal sense legislation allowing alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900 and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in 1959 us territorial incorporation starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s gold rushes in alaska and the nearby yukon territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to alaska alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912 alaskas capital which had been in sitka until 1906 was moved north to juneau construction of the alaska governors mansion began that same year european immigrants from norway and sweden also settled in southeast alaska where they entered the fishing and logging industries during world war ii the aleutian islands campaign focused on attu agattu and kiska all of which were occupied by the empire of japan during the japanese occupation a white american civilian and two united states navy personnel were killed at attu and kiska respectively and nearly a total of 50 aleut civilians and eight sailors were interned in japan about half of the aleuts died during the period of internment unalaskadutch harbor and adak became significant bases for the united states army united states army air forces and united states navy the united states lendlease program involved flying american warplanes through canada to fairbanks and then nome soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft ferrying them to fight the german invasion of the soviet union the construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some alaskan cities statehood statehood for alaska was an important cause of james wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate decades later the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946 the alaska statehood committee and alaskas constitutional convention would soon follow statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes mostly in the us congress but also within alaska statehood was approved by the us congress on july 7 1958 alaska was officially proclaimed a state on january 3 1959 good friday earthquake on march 27 1964 the massive good friday earthquake killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides it was the fourthmostpowerful earthquake in recorded history with a moment magnitude of 92 more than a thousand times as powerful as the 1989 san francisco earthquake the time of day 536 pm time of year spring and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives particularly in anchorage alaska suffered a more severe megathrust earthquake on july 11 1585 estimated at magnitude 925 which remains the most powerful earthquake recorded in north american history and the second most powerful earthquake recorded in world history the good friday earthquake lasted 4 minutes and 38 seconds 600 of fault ruptured at once and moved up to 60 releasing about 500 years of stress buildup soil liquefaction fissures landslides and other ground failures caused major structural damage in several communities and much damage to property anchorage sustained great destruction or damage to many inadequately earthquakeengineered houses buildings and infrastructure paved streets sidewalks water and sewer mains electrical systems and other humanmade equipment particularly in the several landslide zones along knik arm 200 southwest some areas near kodiak were permanently raised by 30 southeast of anchorage areas around the head of turnagain arm near girdwood and portage dropped as much as 8 requiring reconstruction and fill to raise the seward highway above the new high tide mark in prince william sound port valdez suffered a massive underwater landslide resulting in the deaths of 32 people between the collapse of the valdez city harbor and docks and inside the ship that was docked there at the time nearby a 27 tsunami destroyed the village of chenega killing 23 of the 68 people who lived there survivors outran the wave climbing to high ground postquake tsunamis severely affected whittier seward kodiak and other alaskan communities as well as people and property in british columbia washington oregon and california tsunamis also caused damage in hawaii and japan evidence of motion directly related to the earthquake was also reported from florida and texas alaska had never experienced a major disaster in a highly populated area before and had very limited resources for dealing with the effects of such an event in anchorage at the urging of geologist lidia selkregg the city of anchorage and the alaska state housing authority appointed a team of 40 scientists including geologists soil scientists and engineers to assess the damage done by the earthquake to the city the team called the engineering and geological evaluation group was headed by ruth a m schmidt a geology professor at the university of alaska anchorage the team of scientists came into conflict with local developers and downtown business owners who wanted to immediately rebuild the scientists wanted to identify future dangers to ensure that rebuilt infrastructure would be safe the team produced a report on may 8 1964 just a little more than a month after the earthquake the united states military which has a large active presence in alaska also stepped in to assist within moments of the end of the quake the us army rapidly reestablished communications with the lower 48 states deployed troops to assist the citizens of anchorage and dispatched a convoy to valdez on the advice of military and civilian leaders president lyndon b johnson declared all of alaska a major disaster area the day after the quake the us navy and us coast guard deployed ships to isolated coastal communities to assist with immediate needs bad weather and poor visibility hampered air rescue and observation efforts the day after the quake but on sunday the 29th the situation improved and rescue helicopters and observation aircraft were deployed a military airlift immediately began shipping relief supplies to alaska eventually delivering 2570000 of food and other supplies broadcast journalist genie chance assisted in recovery and relief efforts staying on the keni air waves over anchorage for more than 24 continuous hours as the voice of calm from her temporary post within the anchorage public safety building she was effectively designated as the public safety officer by the citys police chief chance provided breaking news of the catastrophic events that continued to develop following the magnitude 92 earthquake and she served as the voice of the public safety office coordinating response efforts connecting available resources to needs around the community disseminating information about shelters and prepared food rations passing messages of wellbeing between loved ones and helping to reunite families in the longer term the us army corps of engineers led the effort to rebuild roads clear debris and establish new townsites for communities that had been completely destroyed at a cost of 110 million the west coast and alaska tsunami warning center was formed as a direct response to the disaster federal disaster relief funds paid for reconstruction as well as financially supporting the devastated infrastructure of alaskas government spending hundreds of millions of dollars that helped keep alaska financially solvent until the discovery of massive oil deposits at prudhoe bay at the order of the us defense department the alaska national guard founded the alaska division of emergency services to respond to any future disasters oil boom the 1968 discovery of oil at prudhoe bay and the 1977 completion of the transalaska pipeline system led to an oil boom royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward oil production was not the only economic value of alaskas land in the second half of the 20th century alaska discovered tourism as an important source of revenue tourism became popular after world war ii when military personnel stationed in the region returned home praising its natural splendor the alcan highway built during the war and the alaska marine highway system completed in 1963 made the state more accessible than before tourism became increasingly important in alaska and today over 14 million people visit the state each year with tourism more vital to the economy environmentalism also rose in importance the alaska national interest lands conservation act anilca of 1980 added 537 million acres 217000 km2 to the national wildlife refuge system parts of 25 rivers to the national wild and scenic rivers system 33 million acres 13000 km2 to national forest lands and 436 million acres 176000 km2 to national park land because of the act alaska now contains twothirds of all american national parklands today more than half of alaskan land is owned by the federal government in 1989 the exxon valdez hit a reef in the prince william sound spilling more than 11 of crude oil over 1100 of coastline today the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and the proposed pebble mine geography located at the northwest corner of north america alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the united states but also has the most easterly longitude in the united states because the aleutian islands extend into the eastern hemisphere alaska is the only noncontiguous us state on continental north america about 500 of british columbia canada separates alaska from washington it is technically part of the continental us but is not usually included in the colloquial use of the term alaska is not part of the contiguous us often called the lower 48 the capital city juneau is situated on the mainland of the north american continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the north american highway system the state is bordered by canadas yukon and british columbia to the east making it the only state to only border a canadian territory the gulf of alaska and the pacific ocean to the south and southwest the bering sea bering strait and chukchi sea to the west and the arctic ocean to the north alaskas territorial waters touch russias territorial waters in the bering strait as the russian big diomede island and alaskan little diomede island are only 3 apart alaska has a longer coastline than all the other us states combined at 663268 in total area alaska is by far the largest state in the united states alaska is more than twice the size of the secondlargest us state texas and it is larger than the next three largest states texas california and montana combined alaska is the seventh largest subnational division in the world if it was an independent nation it would be the 18th largest country in the world almost the same size as iran with its myriad of islands alaska has nearly 34000 of tidal shoreline the aleutian islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the alaska peninsula many active volcanoes are found in the aleutians and in coastal regions unimak island for example is home to mount shishaldin which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to 10000 above the north pacific the chain of volcanoes extends to mount spurr west of anchorage on the mainland geologists have identified alaska as part of wrangellia a large region consisting of multiple states and canadian provinces in the pacific northwest which is actively undergoing continent building one of the worlds largest tides occurs in turnagain arm just south of anchorage where tidal differences can be more than 35 alaska has more than three million lakes marshlands and wetland permafrost cover 188320 mostly in northern western and southwest flatlands glacier ice covers about 28957 of alaska the bering glacier is the largest glacier in north america covering 2008 alone regions there are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of alaska but there are fivesix regions that the state is most commonly broken up into south central the most populous region of alaska containing anchorage the matanuskasusitna valley and the kenai peninsula rural mostly unpopulated areas south of the alaska range and west of the wrangell mountains also fall within the definition of south central as do the prince william sound area and the communities of cordova and valdez southeast also referred to as the panhandle or inside passage this is the region of alaska closest to the contiguous states as such this was where most of the initial nonindigenous settlement occurred in the years following the alaska purchase the region is dominated by the alexander archipelago as well as the tongass national forest the largest national forest in the united states it contains the state capital juneau the former capital sitka and ketchikan at one time alaskas largest city the alaska marine highway provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area and country as only three communities haines hyder and skagway enjoy direct connections to the contiguous north american road system interior the interior is the largest region of alaska much of it is uninhabited wilderness fairbanks is the only large city in the region denali national park and preserve is located here denali formerly mount mckinley is the highest mountain in north america and is also located here north slope the north slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages the area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil and contains both the national petroleum reservealaska and the prudhoe bay oil field the city of utqiaġvik formerly known as barrow is the northernmost city in the united states and is located here the northwest arctic area anchored by kotzebue and also containing the kobuk river valley is often considered part of this region the respective inupiat of the north slope and of the northwest arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people southwest southwest alaskasouthwest alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some 500 inland from the bering sea most of the population lives along the coast kodiak island is also located in southwest the massive yukonkuskokwim delta one of the largest river deltas in the world is here portions of the alaska peninsula are considered part of the southwest with the aleutian islands often but not always being grouped in as well aleutian islands while primarily part of southwest alaska when grouped economically the aleutian islands are sometimes recognized as an alternate group from the rest of the region due to the geographic separation from the continent more than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain which stretches more than 1200 into the pacific ocean some of these islands fall in the eastern hemisphere but the international date line was drawn west of 180 to keep the whole state and thus the entire north american continent within the same legal day two of the islands attu and kiska were occupied by japanese forces during world war ii land ownership according to an october 1998 report by the united states bureau of land management approximately 65 of alaska is owned and managed by the us federal government as public lands including a multitude of national forests national parks and national wildlife refuges of these the bureau of land management manages 87 or 238 of the state the arctic national wildlife refuge is managed by the united states fish and wildlife service it is the worlds largest wildlife refuge comprising 16 of the remaining land area the state of alaska owns 101 its entitlement under the alaska statehood act a portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to the organized boroughs presented above under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteadingrelated opportunities these are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations the university of alaska as a land grant university also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently another 44 are owned by 12 regional and scores of local native corporations created under the alaska native claims settlement act ancsa of 1971 regional native corporation doyon limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in alaska in advertisements and other communications provisions of ancsa allowing the corporations land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect effectively the corporations hold title including subsurface title in many cases a privilege denied to individual alaskans but cannot sell the land individual native allotments are sold on the open market various private interests own the remaining land totaling about one percent of the state alaska is by a large margin the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when native corporation holdings are excluded alaska heritage resources survey the alaska heritage resources survey ahrs is a restricted inventory of all reported historic and prehistoric sites within the us state of alaska it is maintained by the office of history and archaeology the surveys inventory of cultural resources includes objects structures buildings sites districts and travel ways with a general provision that they are more than fifty years old 2012 more than 35000 sites have been reported cities towns and boroughs alaska is not divided into counties as most of the other us states but it is divided into boroughs delegates to the alaska constitutional convention wanted to avoid the pitfalls of the traditional county system and adopted their own unique model many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of alaskas 16 boroughs which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states unlike countyequivalents in the other states the boroughs do not cover the states entire land area the area not part of any borough is referred to as the unorganized borough the unorganized borough has no government of its own but the us census bureau in cooperation with the state divided the unorganized borough into 11 census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation a recording district is a mechanism for management of the public record in alaska the state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a state recorder all recording districts use the same acceptance criteria fee schedule etc for accepting documents into the public record whereas many us states use a threetiered system of decentralizationstatecountytownshipmost of alaska uses only two tiersstateborough owing to the low population density most of the land is located in the unorganized borough as the name implies it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government in 2000 5771 of alaskas area has this status with 1305 of the population anchorage merged the city government with the greater anchorage area borough in 1975 to form the municipality of anchorage containing the city proper and the communities of eagle river chugiak peters creek girdwood bird and indian fairbanks has a separate borough the fairbanks north star borough and municipality the city of fairbanks the states most populous city is anchorage home to 291247 people in 2020 the richest location in alaska by per capita income is denali 42245 yakutat city sitka juneau and anchorage are the four largest cities in the us by area cities and censusdesignated places by population as reflected in the 2020 united states census alaska has a total of 355 incorporated cities and censusdesignated places cdps the tally of cities includes four unified municipalities essentially the equivalent of a consolidated citycounty the majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of alaska known as the bush and are unconnected to that contiguous north american road network the table at the bottom of this section lists about the 100 largest cities and censusdesignated places in alaska in population order of alaskas 2020 us census population figure of 733391 16655 people or 227 of the population did not live in an incorporated city or censusdesignated place approximately threequarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of ketchikan kodiak palmer and wasilla cdps have not been established for these areas by the united states census bureau except that seven cdps were established for the ketchikanarea neighborhoods in the 1980 census clover pass herring cove ketchikan east mountain point north tongass highway pennock island and saxman east but have not been used since the remaining population was scattered throughout alaska both within organized boroughs and in the unorganized borough in largely remote areas climate alaska is the coldest state in the united states the climate in south and southeastern alaska is a midlatitude oceanic climate köppen climate classification cfb and a subarctic oceanic climate köppen cfc in the northern parts with cool summers and relatively mild winters on an annual basis the southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year juneau averages over 50 of precipitation a year and ketchikan averages over 150 this is also the only region in alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter monthsthe climate of anchorage and south central alaska is mild by alaskan standards due to the regions proximity to the seacoast while the area gets less rain than southeast alaska it gets more snow and days tend to be clearer on average anchorage receives 16 of precipitation a year with around 75 of snow although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow it is a subarctic climate köppen dfc due to its brief cool summers the climate of western alaska is determined in large part by the bering sea and the gulf of alaska it is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north the temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is this region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation an area stretching from the northern side of the seward peninsula to the kobuk river valley ie the region around kotzebue sound is technically a desert with portions receiving less than 10 of precipitation annually on the other extreme some locations between dillingham and bethel average around 100 of precipitation the climate of the interior of alaska is subarctic and is a classic example of a continental subarctic climate except in a few valleys where the climate approaches humid continental köppen dfb some of the highest and lowest temperatures in alaska occur around the area near fairbanks summers are warm albeit generally short and may have temperatures reaching into the 90s f the lowtomid 30s c while in the long and very cold winters the temperature can fall below 60 precipitation is sparse in the interior often less than 10 a year but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter the highest and lowest recorded temperatures in alaska are both in the interior the highest is 100 in fort yukon which is just 8 inside the arctic circle on june 27 1915 making alaska tied with hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the united states the lowest official alaska temperature is 80 in prospect creek on january 23 1971 one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental north america in snag yukon canada the climate in the extreme north of alaska north of the brooks range is arctic köppen et with long very cold winters and short cool summers even in july the average low temperature in utqiaġvik is 34 precipitation is light in this part of alaska with many places averaging less than 10 per year mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year flora and fauna demographics the united states census bureau found in the 2020 united states census that the population of alaska was 733391 on

there are also some languages with different dialects most of alaskas native languages belong to either the eskimoaleut or nadene language families some languages are thought to be isolates eg haida or have not yet been classified eg tsimshianic 2014 nearly all of alaskas native languages were classified as either threatened shifting moribund nearly extinct or dormant languages in october 2014 the governor of alaska signed a bill declaring the states 20 indigenous languages to have official status this bill gave them symbolic recognition as official languages though they have not been adopted for official use within the government the 20 languages that were included in the bill are religion rightmultiple surveys have ranked alaska among the most irreligious states according to

seldomnever in 2018 the gospel coalition published an article using pew data and determined nonchurchgoing christians nationwide did not attend religious services often through the following practicing the faith in other ways not finding a house of worship they liked disliking sermons and feeling unwelcomed and logistics in 1795 the first russian orthodox church was established in kodiak intermarriage with alaskan natives helped the russian immigrants integrate into society as a result an increasing number of russian orthodox churches gradually became established within alaska alaska also has the largest quaker population by percentage of any state in 2009 there were 6000 jews in alaska for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems alaskan hindus often share venues and

2018 was 73000 ranking 7th in the nation according to a 2013 study by phoenix marketing international alaska had the fifthlargest number of millionaires per capita in the united states with a ratio of 675 percent the oil and gas industry dominates the alaskan economy with more than 80 of the states revenues derived from petroleum extraction alaskas main export product excluding oil and natural gas is seafood primarily salmon cod pollock and crab agriculture represents a very small fraction of the alaskan economy agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock dairy products vegetables and livestock manufacturing is limited with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction shipping and transportation military bases are a significant component of the economy in the fairbanks north star anchorage and kodiak island boroughs as well as kodiak federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy allowing the state to keep taxes low its industrial outputs are crude petroleum natural gas coal gold precious metals zinc and other mining seafood processing timber and wood products there is also a growing service and tourism sector tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging energy alaska has vast energy resources although its oil reserves have been largely depleted major oil and gas reserves were found in the alaska north slope ans and cook inlet basins but according to the energy information administration by february 2014 alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after texas north dakota and california prudhoe bay on alaskas north slope is still the second highestyielding oil field in the united states typically producing about 400000 although by early 2014 north dakotas bakken formation was producing over 900000 prudhoe bay was the largest conventional oil field ever discovered in north america but was much smaller than canadas enormous athabasca oil sands field which by 2014 was producing about 1500000 of unconventional oil and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate the transalaska pipeline can transport and pump up to 21 of crude oil per day more than any other crude oil pipeline in the united states additionally substantial coal deposits are found in alaskas bituminous subbituminous and lignite coal basins the united states geological survey estimates that there are 854 of undiscovered technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the alaskan north slope alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers large swaths of the alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well alaskas economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating transportation electric power and light although wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped proposals for statewide energy systems eg with special lowcost electric interties were judged uneconomical at the time of the report 2001 due to low less than 50gal fuel prices long distances and low population the cost of a gallon of gas in urban alaska is usually thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs seasonal usage peaks nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors permanent fund the alaska permanent fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed transalaska pipeline system the fund was originally proposed by governor keith miller on the eve of the 1969 prudhoe bay lease sale out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale which amounted to 900 million at once it was later championed by governor jay hammond and kenai state representative hugh malone it has served as an attractive political prospect ever since diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund the alaska constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation from its initial principal of 734000 the fund has grown to 50 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside alaska this has led to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within alaska though such a stance has never gained momentum starting in 1982 dividends from the funds annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans ranging from an initial 1000 in 1982 equal to three years payout as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme to 3269 in 2008 which included a onetime 1200 resource rebate every year the state legislature takes out 8 from the earnings puts 3 back into the principal for inflation proofing and the remaining 5 is distributed to all qualifying alaskans to qualify for the permanent fund dividend one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment the permanent fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a basic income policy in the world cost of living the cost of goods in alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states federal government employees particularly united states postal service usps workers and activeduty military members receive a cost of living allowance usually set at 25 of base pay because while the cost of living has gone down it is still one of the highest in the country rural alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure agriculture and fishing due to the northern climate and short growing season relatively little farming occurs in alaska most farms are in either the matanuska valley about 40 northeast of anchorage or on the kenai peninsula about 60 southwest of anchorage the short 100day growing season limits the crops that can be grown but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons the primary crops are potatoes carrots lettuce and cabbage the tanana valley is another notable agricultural locus especially the delta junction area about 100 southeast of fairbanks with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops these farms mostly lie north and east of fort greely this area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by hammond during his second term as governor deltaarea crops consist predominantly of barley and hay west of fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants the hotel and tourist industry and communitysupported agriculture alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardeners small farms and farmers markets in recent years with the highest percentage increase 46 in the nation in growth in farmers markets in 2011 compared to 17 nationwide the peony industry has also taken off as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world thereby filling a niche in the flower market alaska with no counties lacks county fairs instead a small assortment of state and local fairs with the alaska state fair in palmer the largest are held mostly in the late summer the fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more highprofile commercial activities such as carnival rides concerts and food alaska grown is used as an agricultural slogan alaska has an abundance of seafood with the primary fisheries in the bering sea and the north pacific seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it many alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence as well as sport this includes fish taken by hook net or wheel hunting for subsistence primarily caribou moose and dall sheep is still common in the state particularly in remote bush communities an example of a traditional native food is akutaq the eskimo ice cream which can consist of reindeer fat seal oil dried fish meat and local berries alaskas reindeer herding is concentrated on seward peninsula where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer most food in alaska is transported into the state from outside the other 49 us states and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive in rural areas subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive although most small towns and villages in alaska lie along the coastline the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high because of the terrain and difficult road conditions which change dramatically due to varying climate and precipitation changes the cost of transport can reach as high as 50 per pound 110kg or more in some remote areas during the most difficult times if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions the cost of delivering a 1 of milk is about 350 in many villages where per capita income can be 20000 or less fuel cost per gallon is routinely twenty to thirty cents higher than the contiguous united states average with only hawaii having higher prices culture some of alaskas popular annual events are the iditarod trail sled dog race from anchorage to nome world ice art championships in fairbanks the blueberry festival and alaska hummingbird festival in ketchikan the sitka whale fest and the stikine river garnet fest in wrangell the stikine river attracts the largest springtime concentration of american bald eagles in the world the alaska native heritage center celebrates the rich heritage of alaskas 11 cultural groups their purpose is to encourage crosscultural exchanges among all people and enhance selfesteem among native people the alaska native arts foundation promotes and markets native art from all regions and cultures in the state using the internet music influences on music in alaska include the traditional music of alaska natives as well as folk music brought by later immigrants from russia and europe prominent musicians from alaska include singer jewel traditional aleut flautist mary youngblood folk singersongwriter libby roderick christian music singersongwriter lincoln brewster metalpost hardcore band 36 crazyfists and the groups pamyua and portugal the man there are many established music festivals in alaska including the alaska folk festival the fairbanks summer arts festival the anchorage folk festival the athabascan oldtime fiddling festival the sitka jazz festival the sitka summer music festival and the anchorage chamber music festival the most prominent orchestra in alaska is the anchorage symphony orchestra though the fairbanks symphony orchestra and juneau symphony are also notable the anchorage opera is currently the states only professional opera company though there are several volunteer and semiprofessional organizations in the state as well the official state song of alaska is alaskas flag which was adopted in 1955 it celebrates the flag of alaska film and television the 1983 disney movie never cry wolf was at least partially shot in alaska the 1991 film white fang based on jack londons 1906 novel and starring ethan hawke was filmed in and around haines steven seagals 1994 on deadly ground starring michael caine was filmed in part at the worthington glacier near valdez many reality television shows are filmed in alaska in 2011 the anchorage daily news found ten set in the state sports the following is a list of sporting venues events and teams based in alaska anchorage venues teams events fairbanks venues teams events elsewhere teams events dog mushing public health and safety the alaska state troopers are alaskas statewide police force they have a long and storied history but were not an official organization until 1941 before the force was officially organized law enforcement in alaska was handled by various federal agencies larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on public safety officers who have police training but do not carry firearms in much of the state the troopers serve as the only police force available in addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law wildlife troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the troopers duties they employ a wide variety of land air and water patrol vehicles many rural communities in alaska are considered dry having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages suicide rates for rural residents are higher than urban domestic abuse and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the state this is in part linked to alcohol abuse alaska has the highest rate of sexual assault in the nation especially in rural areas the average age of sexually assaulted victims is 16 years old in four out of five cases the suspects were relatives friends or acquaintances health insurance 2022 cvs health and premera account for 47 and 46 of private health insurance respectively premera and moda health offer insurance on the federallyrun affordable care exchange hospitals providence alaska medical center in anchorage is the largest hospital in the state as of 2021 anchorage also hosts alaska regional hospital and alaska native medical center alaskas other major cities such as fairbanks and juneau also have local hospitals in southeast alaska southeast alaska regional health consortium runs healthcare facilities across 27 communities as of 2022 including hospitals in sitka and wrangell although it originally served native americans only it has expanded access and combined with other local facilities over time education the alaska department of education and early development administers many school districts in alaska in addition the state operates a boarding school mt edgecumbe high school in sitka and provides partial funding for other boarding schools including nenana student living center in nenana and the galena interior learning academy in galena there are more than a dozen colleges and universities in alaska accredited universities in alaska include the university of alaska anchorage university of alaska fairbanks university of alaska southeast and alaska pacific university alaska is the only state that has no collegiate athletic programs that are members of ncaa division i although both alaskafairbanks and alaskaanchorage maintain single sport membership in division i for mens ice hockey the alaska department of labor and workforce development operates avtec alaskas institute of technology campuses in seward and anchorage offer oneweek to 11month training programs in areas as diverse as information technology welding nursing and mechanics alaska has had a problem with a brain drain many of its young people including most of the highest academic achievers leave the state after high school graduation and do not return 2013 alaska did not have a law school or medical school the university of alaska has attempted to combat this by offering partial fouryear scholarships to the top 10 of alaska high school graduates via the alaska scholars program beginning in 1998 schools in rural alaska must have at least 10 students to retain funding from the state and campuses not meeting the number close this was due to the loss in oil revenues that previously propped up smaller rural schools in 2015 there was a proposal to raise that minimum to 25 but legislators in the state largely did not agree transportation road alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the us the states road system covering a relatively small area of the state linking the central population centers and the alaska highway the principal route out of the state through canada the state capital juneau is not accessible by road with access only being through ferry or flight this has spurred debate over decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system or building a road connection from haines the western part of alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of alaska the interstate highways in alaska consists of a total of 1082 one unique feature of the alaska highway system is the anton anderson memorial tunnel an active alaska railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of whittier on prince william sound to the seward highway about 50 southeast of anchorage at portage at 25 the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in north america until 2007 the tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in north america rail built around 1915 the alaska railroad arr played a key role in the development of alaska through the 20th century it links shipping lanes on the north pacific with interior alaska with tracks that run from seward by way of south central alaska passing through anchorage eklutna wasilla talkeetna denali and fairbanks with spurs to whittier palmer and north pole the cities towns villages and region served by arr tracks are known statewide as the railbelt in recent years the everimproving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroads importance in alaskas economy the railroad played a vital role in alaskas development moving freight into alaska while transporting natural resources southward such as coal from the usibelli coal mine near healy to seward and gravel from the matanuska valley to anchorage it is well known for its summertime tour passenger service the alaska railroad was one of the last railroads in north america to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains it continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country a stretch of about 60 of track along an area north of talkeetna remains inaccessible by road the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area until construction of the parks highway in the 1970s the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route in northern southeast alaska the white pass and yukon route also partly runs through the state from skagway northwards into canada british columbia and yukon territory crossing the border at white pass summit this line is now mainly used by tourists often arriving by cruise liner at skagway it was featured in the 1983 bbc television series great little railways these two railroads are connected neither to each other nor any other railroad the nearest link to the north american railway network is the northwest terminus of the canadian national railway at prince rupert british columbia several hundred miles to the southeast in 2000 the us congress authorized 6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between alaska canada and the lower 48 as of 2021 the alaskaalberta railway development corporation had been placed into receivership some private companies provides car float service between whittier and seattle sea many cities towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access the only modes of access involve travel by air river or the sea alaskas welldeveloped stateowned ferry system known as the alaska marine highway serves the cities of southeast the gulf coast and the alaska peninsula the ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers the system also operates a ferry service from bellingham washington and prince rupert british columbia in canada through the inside passage to skagway the interisland ferry authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the prince of wales island region of southeast and works in concert with the alaska marine highway in recent years cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market mainly connecting the pacific northwest to southeast alaska and to a lesser degree towns along alaskas gulf coast the population of ketchikan for example fluctuates dramatically on many daysup to four large cruise ships can dock there at the same time air cities not served by road sea or river can be reached only by air foot dogsled or snowmachine accounting for alaskas extremely well developed bush air servicesan alaskan novelty anchorage and to a lesser extent fairbanks is served by many major airlines because of limited highway access air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at ted stevens anchorage international airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism in 20122013 alaska received almost two million visitors making regular flights to most villages and towns within the state commercially viable is difficult so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the essential air service program alaska airlines is the only major airline offering instate travel with jet service sometimes in combination cargo and passenger boeing 737400s from anchorage and fairbanks to regional hubs like bethel nome kotzebue dillingham kodiak and other larger communities as well as to major southeast and alaska peninsula communities the bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as ravn alaska penair and frontier flying service the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the cessna caravan the most popular aircraft in use in the state much of this service can be attributed to the alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to alaskan rural communities the program requires 70 of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities many communities have small air taxi services these operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas perhaps the most quintessentially alaskan plane is the bush seaplane the worlds busiest seaplane base is lake hood located next to ted stevens anchorage international airport where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers cargo and many items from stores and warehouse clubs in 2006 alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any us state in alaska there are 8795 active pilot certificates as of 2020 snow another alaskan transportation method is the dogsled in modern times that is any time after the midlate 1920s dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation various races are held around the state but the best known is the iditarod trail sled dog race a 1150 trail from anchorage to nome although the distance varies from year to year the official distance is set at 1049 the race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to nome in which mushers and dogs like togo and balto took muchneeded medicine to the diphtheriastricken community of nome when all other means of transportation had failed mushers from all over the world come to anchorage each march to compete for cash prizes and prestige the serum run is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay leaving from the community of nenana southwest of fairbanks to nome in areas not served by road or rail primary transportation in summer is by allterrain vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or snow machine as it is commonly referred to in alaska communication alaskas internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies gci and alaska communications gci owns and operates what it calls the alaska united fiber optic system and as of late 2011 alaska communications advertised that it has two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across alaska in january 2011 it was reported that a 1 billion project to connect asia and rural alaska was being planned aided in part by 350 million in stimulus from the federal government law and government state government like all other us states alaska is governed as a republic with three branches of government an executive branch consisting of the governor of alaska and their appointees which head executive departments a legislative branch consisting of the alaska house of representatives and alaska senate and a judicial branch consisting of the alaska supreme court and lower courts the state of alaska employs approximately 16000 people statewide the alaska legislature consists of a 40member house of representatives and a 20member senate senators serve fouryear terms and house members two the governor of alaska serves fouryear terms the lieutenant governor runs separately from the governor in the primaries but during the general election the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket alaskas court system has four levels the alaska supreme court the alaska court of appeals the superior courts and the district courts the superior and district courts are trial courts superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction while district courts hear only certain types of cases including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to 100000 the supreme court and the court of appeals are appellate courts the court of appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lowercourt decisions including those regarding criminal prosecutions juvenile delinquency and habeas corpus the supreme court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals state politics although in its early years of statehood alaska was a democratic state since the early 1970s it has been characterized as republicanleaning local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development fishing tourism and individual rights alaska natives while organized in and around their communities have been active within the native corporations these have been given ownership over large tracts of land which require stewardship alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in ones home was completely legal under state law though the federal law remains in force the state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the united states with the alaskan independence party six republicans and four democrats have served as governor of alaska in addition republican governor wally hickel was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the republican party and briefly joining the alaskan independence party ticket just long enough to be reelected he officially rejoined the republican party in 1994 alaskas voter initiative making marijuana legal took effect on february 24 2015 placing alaska alongside colorado and washington as well as washington dc as the first three us states where recreational marijuana is legal the new law means people over 21 can consume small amounts of cannabis the first legal marijuana store opened in valdez in october 2016 voter registration taxes to finance state government operations alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies this allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the united states it is one of five states with no sales tax one of seven states with no individual income tax andalong with new hampshireone of two that has neither the department of revenue tax division reports regularly on the states revenue sources the department also issues an annual summary of its operations including new state laws that directly affect the tax division in 2014 the tax foundation ranked alaska as having the fourth most business friendly tax policy behind only wyoming south dakota and nevada while alaska has no state sales tax 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax from 10 to 75 typically 35 other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes hotel motel and bedandbreakfast bed taxes severance taxes liquor and tobacco taxes gaming pull tabs taxes tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes a part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees such as petroleum aviation motor fuel telephone cooperative is shared with municipalities in alaska the fall in oil prices after the fracking boom in the early 2010s has decimated alaskas state treasury which has historically received about 85 percent of its revenue from taxes and fees imposed on oil and gas companies the state government has had to drastically reduce its budget and has brought its budget shortfall from over 2 billion in 2016 to under 500 million by 2018 in 2020 alaskas state government budget was 48 billion while projected government revenues were only 45 billion federal politics alaska regularly supports republicans in presidential elections and has done so since statehood republicans have won the states electoral college votes in all but one election that it has participated in 1964 no state has voted for a democratic presidential candidate fewer times alaska was carried by democratic nominee lyndon b johnson during his landslide election in 1964 while the 1960 and 1968 elections were close since 1972 republicans have carried the state by large margins in 2008 republican john mccain defeated democrat barack obama in alaska 5949 to 3783 mccains running mate was sarah palin the states governor and the first alaskan on a major party ticket obama lost alaska again in 2012 but he captured 40 of the states vote in that election making him the first democrat to do so since 1968 in 2020 joe biden received 4277 of the vote for president marking the high point for a democratic presidential candidate since johnsons 1964 victory the alaska bush central juneau midtown and downtown anchorage and the areas surrounding the university of alaska fairbanks campus and ester have been strongholds of the democratic party the matanuskasusitna borough the majority of fairbanks including north pole and the military base and south anchorage typically have the strongest republican showing elections alaska has had a long history of primary defeats for incumbent us senators with ernest gruening mike gravel and lisa murkowski all defeated for the nomination to their reelection murkowski won reelection with a writein campaign despite this alaska has had some longserving members of congress with ted stevens serving as us senator for 40 years and don young serving as the atlarge representative for 49 years in the 2020 election cycle alaskan voters approved ballot measure 2 the measure passed by a margin of 11 or about 4000 votes the measure requires campaigns to disclose the original source and any intermediaries for campaign contributions over 2000 the measure also establishes nonpartisan blanket primaries for statewide elections like in washington state and california and rankedchoice voting like in maine measure 2 makes alaska the third state with jungle primaries for all statewide races the second state with ranked choice voting and the only state with both the first race to use the new system of elections was the 2022 special election to fill alaskas only us house seat left vacant by the death of don young won by mary peltola the first democrat to win the house seat since 1972 and the first alaskan native to be elected to the united states congress in history see also notes references external links us federal government alaska state government agriculture categories agriculture agronomy food industry agriculture encompasses crop and livestock production aquaculture fisheries and forestry for food and nonfood products agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities while humans started gathering grains at least 105000 years ago nascent farmers only began planting them around 11500 years ago sheep goats pigs and cattle were domesticated around 10000 years ago plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world in the 20th century industrial agriculture based on largescale monocultures came to dominate agricultural output 2021 small farms produce about onethird of the worlds food but large farms are prevalent the largest 1 of farms in the world are greater than 50 and operate more than 70 of the worlds farmland nearly 40 of agricultural land is found on farms larger than 1000 however five of every six farms in the world consist of less than 2 and take up only around 12 of all agricultural land farms and farming greatly influence rural economics and greatly shape rural society effecting both the direct agricultural workforce and broader businesses that support the farms and farming populations the major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods fibers fuels and raw materials such as rubber food classes include cereals grains vegetables fruits cooking oils meat milk eggs and fungi global agricultural production amounts to approximately 11 billion tonnes of food 32 million tonnes of natural fibres and 4 billion m3 of wood however around 14 of the worlds food is lost from production before reaching the retail level modern agronomy plant breeding agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields but also contributed to ecological and environmental damage selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage environmental issues include contributions to climate change depletion of aquifers deforestation antibiotic resistance and other agricultural pollution agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation such as biodiversity loss desertification soil degradation and climate change all of which can cause decreases in crop yield genetically modified organisms are widely used although some countries ban them etymology and scope the word agriculture is a late middle english adaptation of latin la from la field and la cultivation or growing while agriculture usually refers to human activities certain species of ant termite and beetle have been cultivating crops for up to 60 million years agriculture is defined with varying scopes in its broadest sense using natural resources to produce commodities which maintain life including food fiber forest products horticultural crops and their related services thus defined it includes arable farming horticulture animal husbandry and forestry but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded it may also be broadly decomposed into plant agriculture which concerns the cultivation of useful plants and animal agriculture the production of agricultural animals history origins the development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe and included a diverse range of taxa in at least 11 separate centers of origin wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105000 years ago in the paleolithic levant 23000 years ago cereals cultivation of emmer barley and oats has been observed near the sea of galilee rice was domesticated in china between 11500 and 6200 bc with the earliest known cultivation from 5700 bc followed by mung soy and azuki beans sheep were domesticated in mesopotamia between 13000 and 11000 years ago cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern turkey and pakistan some 10500 years ago pig production emerged in eurasia including europe east asia and southwest asia where wild boar were first domesticated about 10500 years ago in the andes of south america the potato was domesticated between 10000 and 7000 years ago along with beans coca llamas alpacas and guinea pigs sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in new guinea around 9000 years ago sorghum was domesticated in the sahel region of africa by 7000 years ago cotton was domesticated in peru by 5600 years ago and was independently domesticated in eurasia in mesoamerica wild teosinte was bred into maize corn from 10000 to 6000 years ago the horse was domesticated in the eurasian steppes around 3500 bc scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture studies of the transition from huntergatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism examples are the natufian culture in the levant and the early chinese neolithic in china then wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted and gradually came to be domesticated civilizations filecentres of origin and spread of agriculturesvgthumbrightupright135map of the world showing approximate centers of origin of agriculture and its spread in prehistory dna studies have shown that agriculture was introduced in europe by the expansion of the early farmers from anatolia about 9000 years ago  in eurasia the sumerians started to live in villages from about 8000 bc relying on the tigris and euphrates rivers and a canal system for irrigation ploughs appear in pictographs around 3000 bc seedploughs around 2300 bc farmers grew wheat barley vegetables such as lentils and onions and fruits including dates grapes and figs ancient egyptian agriculture relied on the nile river and its seasonal flooding farming started in the predynastic period at the end of the paleolithic after 10000 bc staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley alongside industrial crops such as flax and papyrus in india wheat barley and jujube were domesticated by 9000 bc soon followed by sheep and goats cattle sheep and goats were domesticated in mehrgarh culture by 80006000 bc cotton was cultivated by the 5th4th millennium bc archeological evidence indicates an animaldrawn plough from 2500 bc in the indus valley civilisation in china from the 5th century bc there was a nationwide granary system and widespread silk farming waterpowered grain mills were in use by the 1st century bc followed by irrigation by the late 2nd century heavy ploughs had been developed with iron ploughshares and mouldboards these spread westwards across eurasia asian rice was domesticated 820013500 years ago  depending on the molecular clock estimate that is used on the pearl river in southern china with a single genetic origin from the wild rice oryza rufipogon in greece and rome the major cereals were wheat emmer and barley alongside vegetables including peas beans and olives sheep and goats were kept mainly for dairy products in the americas crops domesticated in mesoamerica apart from teosinte include squash beans and cacao cocoa was domesticated by the mayo chinchipe of the upper amazon around 3000 bc the turkey was probably domesticated in mexico or the american southwest the aztecs developed irrigation systems formed terraced hillsides fertilized their soil and developed chinampas or artificial islands the mayas used extensive canal and raised field systems to farm swampland from 400 bc in south america agriculture may have begun about 9000 bc with the domestication of squash cucurbita and other plants coca was domesticated in the andes as were the peanut tomato tobacco and pineapple cotton was domesticated in peru by 3600 bc animals including llamas alpacas and guinea pigs were domesticated there in north america the indigenous people of the east domesticated crops such as sunflower tobacco squash and chenopodium wild foods including wild rice and maple sugar were harvested the domesticated strawberry is a hybrid of a chilean and a north american species developed by breeding in europe and north america the indigenous people of the southwest and the pacific northwest practiced forest gardening and firestick farming the natives controlled fire on a regional scale to create a lowintensity fire ecology that sustained a lowdensity agriculture in loose rotation a sort of wild permaculture a system of companion planting called the three sisters was developed in north america the three crops were winter squash maize and climbing beans indigenous australians long supposed to have been nomadic huntergatherers practised systematic burning possibly to enhance natural productivity in firestick farming scholars have pointed out that huntergatherers need a productive environment to support gathering without cultivation because the forests of new guinea have few food plants early humans may have used selective burning to increase the productivity of the wild karuka fruit trees to support the huntergatherer way of life the gunditjmara and other groups developed eel farming and fish trapping systems from some 5000 years ago there is evidence of intensification across the whole continent over that period in two regions of australia the central west coast and eastern central early farmers cultivated yams native millet and bush onions possibly in permanent settlements revolution in the middle ages compared to the roman period agriculture in western europe became more focused on selfsufficiency the agricultural population under feudalism was typically organized into manors consisting of several hundred or more acres of land presided over by a lord of the manor with a roman catholic church and priest thanks to the exchange with the alandalus where the arab agricultural revolution was underway european agriculture transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants including the introduction of sugar rice cotton and fruit trees such as the orange after 1492 the columbian exchange brought new world crops such as maize potatoes tomatoes sweet potatoes and manioc to europe and old world crops such as wheat barley rice and turnips and livestock including horses cattle sheep and goats to the americas irrigation crop rotation and fertilizers advanced from the 17th century with the british agricultural revolution allowing global population to rise significantly since 1900 agriculture in developed nations and to a lesser extent in the developing world has seen large rises in productivity as mechanization replaces human labor and assisted by synthetic fertilizers pesticides and selective breeding the haberbosch method allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale greatly increasing crop yields and sustaining a further increase in global population modern agriculture has raised or encountered ecological political and economic issues including water pollution biofuels genetically modified organisms tariffs and farm subsidies leading to alternative approaches such as the organic movement unsustainable farming practices in north america led to the dust bowl of the 1930s types pastoralism involves managing domesticated animals in nomadic pastoralism herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture fodder and water this type of farming is practised in arid and semiarid regions of sahara central asia and some parts of india in shifting cultivation a small area of forest is cleared by cutting and burning the trees the cleared land is used for growing crops for a few years until the soil becomes too infertile and the area is abandoned another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated this type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly this practice is used in northeast india southeast asia and the amazon basin subsistence farming is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone with little left over for transport elsewhere it is intensively practiced in monsoon asia and southeast asia an estimated 25 billion subsistence farmers worked in 2018 cultivating about 60 of the earths arable land intensive farming is cultivation to maximise productivity with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs water fertilizer pesticide and automation it is practiced mainly in developed countries contemporary agriculture status from the twentieth century onwards intensive agriculture increased crop productivity it substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labour but caused increased water pollution and often involved farm subsidies soil degradation and diseases such as stem rust are major concerns globally approximately 40 of the worlds agricultural land is seriously degraded in recent years there has been a backlash against the environmental effects of conventional agriculture resulting in the organic regenerative and sustainable agriculture movements one of the major forces behind this movement has been the european union which first certified organic food in 1991 and began reform of its common agricultural policy cap in 2005 to phase out commoditylinked farm subsidies also known as decoupling the growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest management selective breeding and controlledenvironment agriculture there are concerns about the lower yield associated with organic farming and its impact on global food security recent mainstream technological developments include genetically modified food by 2015 the agricultural output of china was the largest in the world followed by the european union india and the united states economists measure the total factor productivity of agriculture according to which agriculture in the united states is roughly 17 times more productive than it was in 1948 agriculture employed 873 million people in 2021 or 27 of the global workforce compared with 1 027 million or 40 in 2000 the share of agriculture in global gdp was stable at around 4 since 2000  2023 despite increases in agricultural production and productivity between 702 and 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021 food insecurity and malnutrition can be the result of conflict climate extremes and variability and economic swings it can also be caused by a countrys structural characteristics such as income status and natural resource endowments as well as its political economy pesticide use in agriculture went up 62 between 2000 and 2021 with the americas accounting for half the use in 2021 the international fund for agricultural development posits that an increase in smallholder agriculture may be part of the solution to concerns about food prices and overall food security given the favorable experience of vietnam workforce agriculture provides about onequarter of all global employment more than half in subsaharan africa and almost 60 percent in lowincome countries as countries develop other jobs have historically pulled workers away from agriculture and laboursaving innovations increase agricultural productivity by reducing labour requirements per unit of output over time a combination of labour supply and labour demand trends have driven down the share of population employed in agriculture during the 16th century in europe between 55 and 75 of the population was engaged in agriculture by the 19th century this had dropped to between 35 and 65 in the same countries today the figure is less than 10 at the start of the 21st century some one billion people or over 13 of the available work force were employed in agriculture this constitutes approximately 70 of the global employment of children and in many countries constitutes the largest percentage of women of any industry the service sector overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in 2007 in many developed countries immigrants help fill labour shortages in highvalue agriculture activities that are difficult to mechanize foreign farm workers from mostly eastern europe north africa and south asia constituted around onethird of the salaried agricultural workforce in spain italy greece and portugal in 2013 in the united states of america more than half of all hired farmworkers roughly 450000 workers were immigrants in 2019 although the number of new immigrants arriving in the country to work in agriculture has fallen by 75 percent in recent years and rising wages indicate this has led to a major labor shortage on us farms women in agriculture around the world women make up a large share of the population employed in agriculture this share is growing in all developing regions except east and southeast asia where women already make up about 50 percent of the agricultural workforce women make up 47 percent of the agricultural workforce in subsaharan africa a rate that has not changed significantly in the past few decades however the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao posits that the roles and responsibilities of women in agriculture may be changing  for example from subsistence farming to wage employment and from contributing household members to primary producers in the context of maleoutmigration in general women account for a greater share of agricultural employment at lower levels of economic development as inadequate education limited access to basic infrastructure and markets high unpaid work burden and poor rural employment opportunities outside agriculture severely limit womens opportunities for offfarm work women who work in agricultural production tend to do so under highly unfavourable conditions they tend to be concentrated in the poorest countries where alternative livelihoods are not available and they maintain the intensity of their work in conditions of climateinduced weather shocks and in situations of conflict women are less likely to participate as entrepreneurs and independent farmers and are engaged in the production of less lucrative crops the gender gap in land productivity between female and male managed farms of the same size is 24 percent on average women earn 184 percent less than men in wage employment in agriculture this means that women receive 82 cents for every dollar earned by men progress has been slow in closing gaps in womens access to irrigation and in ownership of livestock too women in agriculture still have significantly less access than men to inputs including improved seeds fertilizers and mechanized equipment on a positive note the gender gap in access to mobile internet in low and middleincome countries fell from 25 percent to 16 percent between 2017 and 2021 and the gender gap in access to bank accounts narrowed from 9 to 6 percentage points women are as likely as men to adopt new technologies when the necessary enabling factors are put in place and they have equal access to complementary resources safety agriculture specifically farming remains a hazardous industry and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of workrelated injuries lung disease noiseinduced hearing loss skin diseases as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure on industrialized farms injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can be hazardous to worker health and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects as an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself entire families can be at risk for injuries illness and death ages 06 may be an especially vulnerable population in agriculture common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning machinery and motor accidents including with allterrain vehicles the international labour organization considers agriculture one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors it estimates that the annual workrelated death toll among agricultural employees is at least 170000 twice the average rate of other jobs in addition incidences of death injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported the organization has developed the safety and health in agriculture convention 2001 which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play in the united states agriculture has been identified by the national institute for occupational safety and health as a priority industry sector in the national occupational research agenda to identify and provide intervention strategies for occupational health and safety issues in the european union the european agency for safety and health at work has issued guidelines on implementing health and safety directives in agriculture livestock farming horticulture and forestry the agricultural safety and health council of america ashca also holds a yearly summit to discuss safety production overall production varies by country as listed crop cultivation systems cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints geography and climate of the farm government policy economic social and political pressures and the philosophy and culture of the farmer shifting cultivation or slash and burn is a system in which forests are burnt releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a period of several years then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest and the farmer moves to a new plot returning after many more years 1020 this fallow period is shortened if population density grows requiring the input of nutrients fertilizer or manure and some manual pest control annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period this requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs further industrialization led to the use of monocultures when one cultivar is planted on a large acreage because of the low biodiversity nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up necessitating the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers multiple cropping in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year and intercropping when several crops are grown at the same time are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as polycultures in subtropical and arid environments the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year or requiring irrigation in all of these environments perennial crops are grown coffee chocolate and systems are practiced such as agroforestry in temperate environments where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system important categories of food crops include cereals legumes forage fruits and vegetables natural fibers include cotton wool hemp silk and flax specific crops are cultivated in distinct growing regions throughout the world production is listed in millions of metric tons based on fao estimates livestock production systems animal husbandry is the breeding and raising of animals for meat milk eggs or wool and for work and transport working animals including horses mules oxen water buffalo camels llamas alpacas donkeys and dogs have for centuries been used to help cultivate fields harvest crops wrangle other animals and transport farm products to buyers livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source as grasslandbased mixed and landless 2010 30 of earths ice and waterfree area was used for producing livestock with the sector employing approximately 13 billion people between the 1960s and the 2000s there was a significant increase in livestock production both by numbers and by carcass weight especially among beef pigs and chickens the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10 nonmeat animals such as milk cows and eggproducing chickens also showed significant production increases global cattle sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050 aquaculture or fish farming the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production growing at an average of 9 a year between 1975 and 2007 during the second half of the 20th century producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock breeds and crossbreeds that increased production while mostly disregarding the need to preserve genetic diversity this trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland rangeland and pastures for feeding ruminant animals outside nutrient inputs may be used however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source this system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil representing 3040 million pastoralists mixed production systems use grassland fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric one stomach mainly chickens and pigs livestock manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm representing the delinking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in organisation for economic cooperation and development member countries synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure use becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork scientists estimate that 75 of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in confined animal feeding operations sometimes called factory farming much of this growth is happening in developing countries in asia with much smaller amounts of growth in africa some of the practices used in commercial livestock production including the usage of growth hormones are controversial production practices tillage is the practice of breaking up the soil with tools such as the plow or harrow to prepare for planting for nutrient incorporation or for pest control tillage varies in intensity from conventional to notill it can improve productivity by warming the soil incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds but also renders soil more prone to erosion triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing co2 and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms pest control includes the management of weeds insects mites and diseases chemical pesticides biological biocontrol mechanical tillage and cultural practices are used cultural practices include crop rotation culling cover crops intercropping composting avoidance and resistance integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss and recommends pesticides as a last resort nutrient management includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production and the method of use of manure produced by livestock nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers manure green manure compost and minerals crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a fallow period manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing such as in managed intensive rotational grazing or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pastures water management is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall in other areas such as the great plains in the us and canada farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture for the following year recent technological innovations in precision agriculture allow for water status monitoring and automate water usage leading to more efficient management agriculture represents 70 of freshwater use worldwide however water withdrawal ratios for agriculture vary significantly by income level in least developed countries and landlocked developing countries water withdrawal ratios for agriculture are as high as 90 percent of total water withdrawals and about 60 percent in small island developing states according to 2014 report by the international food policy research institute agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity food security and trade by 2050 the international food policy research institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40 and food prices could be reduced by almost half payment for ecosystem services is a method of providing additional incentives to encourage farmers to conserve some aspects of the environment measures might include paying for reforestation upstream of a city to improve the supply of fresh water agricultural automation different definitions exist for agricultural automation and for the variety of tools and technologies that are used to automate production one view is that agricultural automation refers to autonomous navigation by robots without human intervention alternatively it is defined as the accomplishment of production tasks through mobile autonomous decisionmaking mechatronic devices however fao finds that these definitions do not capture all the aspects and forms of automation such as robotic milking machines that are static most motorized machinery that automates the performing of agricultural operations and digital tools eg sensors that automate only diagnosis fao defines agricultural automation as the use of machinery and equipment in agricultural operations to improve their diagnosis decisionmaking or performing reducing the drudgery of agricultural work or improving the timeliness and potentially the precision of agricultural operations the technological evolution in agriculture has involved a progressive move from manual tools to animal traction to motorized mechanization to digital equipment and finally to robotics with artificial intelligence ai motorized mechanization using engine power automates the performance of agricultural operations such as ploughing and milking with digital automation technologies it also becomes possible to automate diagnosis and decisionmaking of agricultural operations for example autonomous crop robots can harvest and seed crops while drones can gather information to help automate input application precision agriculture often employs such automation technologies motorized machines are increasingly complemented or even superseded by new digital equipment that automates diagnosis and decisionmaking a conventional tractor for example can be converted into an automated vehicle allowing it to sow a field autonomously motorized mechanization has increased significantly across the world in recent years although reliable global data with broad country coverage exist only for tractors and only up to 2009 subsaharan africa is the only region where the adoption of motorized mechanization has stalled over the past decades automation technologies are increasingly used for managing livestock though evidence on adoption is lacking global automatic milking system sales have increased over recent years but adoption is likely mostly in northern europe and likely almost absent in low and middleincome countries automated feeding machines for both cows and poultry also exist but data and evidence regarding their adoption trends and drivers is likewise scarce measuring the overall employment impacts of agricultural automation is difficult because it requires large amounts of data tracking all the transformations and the associated reallocation of workers both upstream and downstream while automation technologies reduce labour needs for the newly automated tasks they also generate new labour demand for other tasks such as equipment maintenance and operation agricultural automation can also stimulate employment by allowing producers to expand production and by creating other agrifood systems jobs this is especially true when it happens in context of rising scarcity of rural labour as is the case in highincome countries and many middleincome countries on the other hand if forcedly promoted for example through government subsidies in contexts of abundant rural labour it can lead to labour displacement and falling or stagnant wages particularly affecting poor and lowskilled workers effects of climate change on yields climate change and agriculture are interrelated on a global scale climate change affects agriculture through changes in average temperatures rainfall and weather extremes like storms and heat waves changes in pests and diseases changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and groundlevel ozone concentrations changes in the nutritional quality of some foods and changes in sea level global warming is already affecting agriculture with effects unevenly distributed across the world in a 2022 report the intergovernmental panel on climate change describes how humaninduced warming has slowed growth of agricultural productivity over the past 50 years in mid and low latitudes methane emissions have negatively impacted crop yields by increasing temperatures and surface ozone concentrations warming is also negatively affecting crop and grassland quality and harvest stability ocean warming has decreased sustainable yields of some wild fish populations while ocean acidification and warming have already affected farmed aquatic species climate change will probably increase the risk of food insecurity for some vulnerable groups such as the poor crop alteration and biotechnology plant breeding crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years since the beginning of civilization altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic makeup of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans for example larger fruits or seeds droughttolerance or resistance to pests significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist gregor mendel his work on dominant and recessive alleles although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits selfpollination and crosspollination and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism domestication of plants has over the centuries increased yield improved disease resistance and drought tolerance eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture grasses and clover in new zealand extensive xray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts ie primitive genetic engineering during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat corn maize and barley the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to sharply increase yield by creating highyielding varieties for example average yields of corn maize in the us have increased from around 25 tons per hectare tha 40 bushels per acre in 1900 to about 94 tha 150 bushels per acre in 2001 similarly worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 tha in 1900 to more than 25 tha in 1990 south american average wheat yields are around 2 tha african under 1 tha and egypt and arabia up to 35 to 4 tha with irrigation in contrast the average wheat yield in countries such as france is over 8 tha variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate genetics and the level of intensive farming techniques use of fertilizers chemical pest control and growth control to avoid lodging genetic engineering genetically modified organisms gmo are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant dna technology genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to use in creating desired germlines for new crops increased durability nutritional content insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering for some gmo crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production import or use of gmo foods and crops the biosafety protocol an international treaty regulates the trade of gmos there is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from gmos and while the eu currently requires all gmo foods to be labeled the us does not herbicideresistant seeds have a gene implanted into their genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides including glyphosate these seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop herbicidetolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide with the increasing use of herbicidetolerant crops comes an increase in the use of glyphosatebased herbicide sprays in some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed causing farmers to switch to other herbicides some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern with potential economic and health implications other gmo crops used by growers include insectresistant crops which have a gene from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis bt which produces a toxin specific to insects these crops resist damage by insects some believe that similar or better pestresistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or crosspollination with wild species in some cases wild species are the primary source of resistance traits some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes environmental impact effects and costs agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation such as biodiversity loss desertification soil degradation and climate change which cause decreases in crop yield agriculture is one of the most important drivers of environmental pressures particularly habitat change climate change water use and toxic emissions agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment including insecticides especially those used on cottondecember 2021 the 2011 unep green economy report stated that agricultural operations produced some 13 per cent of anthropogenic global greenhouse gas emissions this includes gases from the use of inorganic fertilizers agrochemical pesticides and herbicides as well as fossil fuelenergy inputs agriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as pesticide damage to nature especially herbicides and insecticides nutrient runoff excessive water usage and loss of natural environment a 2000 assessment of agriculture in the uk determined total external costs for 1996 of 2343 million or 208 per hectare a 2005 analysis of these costs in the us concluded that cropland imposes approximately 5 to 16 billion 30 to 96 per hectare while livestock production imposes 714 million both studies which focused solely on the fiscal impacts concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs neither included subsidies in their analysis but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society agriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs often employing measures that cut biodiversity to very low levels yield increases with inputs such as fertilisers and removal of pathogens predators and competitors such as weeds costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units such as making fields larger this means removing hedges ditches and other areas of habitat pesticides kill insects plants and fungi effective yields fall with onfarm losses which may be caused by poor production practices during harvesting handling and storage the environmental effects of climate change show that research on pests and diseases that do not generally afflict areas is essential in 2021 farmers discovered stem rust on wheat in the champagne area of france a disease that had previously only occurred in morocco for 20 to 30 years because of climate change insects that used to die off over the winter are now alive and multiplying livestock issues a senior un official henning steinfeld said that livestock are one of the most significant contributors to todays most serious environmental problems livestock production occupies 70 of all land used for agriculture or 30 of the land surface of the planet it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases responsible for 18 of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions as measured in co2 equivalents by comparison all transportation emits 135 of the co2 it produces 65 of humanrelated nitrous oxide which has 296 times the global warming potential of co2 and 37 of all humaninduced methane which is 23 times as warming as co2 it also generates 64 of the ammonia emission livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation in the amazon basin 70 of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feed crops through deforestation and land degradation livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity furthermore the united nations environment programme unep states that methane emissions from global livestock are projected to increase by 60 per cent by 2030 under current practices and consumption patterns land and water issues land transformation the use of land to yield goods and services is the most substantial way humans alter the earths ecosystems and is the driving force causing biodiversity loss estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39 to 50 it is estimated that 24 of land globally experiences land degradation a longterm decline in ecosystem function and productivity with cropland being disproportionately affected land management is the driving factor behind degradation 15 billion people rely upon the degrading land degradation can be through deforestation desertification soil erosion mineral depletion acidification or salinization in 2021 the global agricultural land area was 479 billion hectares ha down 2 percent or 009 billion ha compared with 2000 between 2000 and 2021 roughly twothirds of agricultural land were used for permanent meadows and pastures 321 billion ha in 2021 which declined by 5 percent 017 billion ha onethird of the total agricultural land was cropland 158 billion ha in 2021 which increased by 6 percent 009 billion ha eutrophication excessive nutrient enrichment in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal blooms and anoxia leads to fish kills loss of biodiversity and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient mainly nitrogen and phosphorus runoff and leaching from agricultural land these nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and pollution of groundwater with harmful effects on human populations fertilisers also reduce terrestrial biodiversity by increasing competition for light favouring those species that are able to benefit from the added nutrients agriculture simultaneously is facing growing freshwater demand and precipitation anomalies droughts floods and extreme rainfall and weather events on rainfed areasfields and grazing lands agriculture accounts for 70 percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources and an estimated 41 percent of current global irrigation water use occurs at the expense of environmental flow requirements it is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern china the upper ganges and the western us are being depleted and new research extends these problems to aquifers in iran mexico and saudi arabia increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas meaning that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the worlds growing population with reduced water resources while industrial withdrawals have declined in the past few decades and municipal withdrawals have increased only marginally since 2010 agricultural withdrawals have continued to grow at an ever faster pace agricultural water usage can also cause major environmental problems including the destruction of natural wetlands the spread of waterborne diseases and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging when irrigation is performed incorrectly pesticides pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 25 million short tons annually worldwide yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant the world health organization estimated in 1992 that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually causing 220000 deaths pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population leading to a condition termed the pesticide treadmill in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide an alternative argument is that the way to save the environment and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming a view exemplified by a quote heading the center for global food issues website growing more per acre leaves more land for nature however critics argue that a tradeoff between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable and that pesticides can replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation the pushpull agricultural pest management technique involves intercropping using plant aromas to repel pests from crops push and to lure them to a place from which they can then be removed pull contribution to climate change agriculture contributes towards climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and by the conversion of nonagricultural land such as forests into agricultural land the agriculture forestry and land use sector contribute between 13 and 21 of global greenhouse gas emissions emissions of nitrous oxide methane make up over half of total greenhouse gas emission from agriculture animal husbandry is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions approximately 57 of global ghg emissions from the production of food are from the production of animalbased food while plantbased foods contribute 29 and the remaining 14 is for other utilizations farmland management and landuse change represented major shares of total emissions 38 and 29 respectively whereas rice and beef were the largest contributing plant and animalbased commodities 12 and 25 respectively south and southeast asia and south america were the largest emitters of productionbased ghgs sustainability current farming methods have resulted in overstretched water resources high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices therefore how water land and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered a solution would be to give value to ecosystems recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable technology permits innovations like conservation tillage a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion reduces water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration agricultural automation can help address some of the challenges associated with climate change and thus facilitate adaptation efforts for example the application of digital automation technologies eg in precision agriculture can improve resourceuse efficiency in conditions which are increasingly constrained for agricultural producers moreover when applied to sensing and early warning they can help address the uncertainty and unpredictability of weather conditions associated with accelerating climate change other potential sustainable practices include conservation agriculture agroforestry improved grazing avoided grassland conversion and biochar current monocrop farming practices in the united states preclude widespread adoption of sustainable practices such as 23 crop rotations that incorporate grass or hay with annual crops unless negative emission goals such as soil carbon sequestration become policy the food demand of earths projected population with current climate change predictions could be satisfied by improvement of agricultural methods expansion of agricultural areas and a sustainabilityoriented consumer mindset energy dependence since the 1940s agricultural productivity has increased dramatically due largely to the increased use of energyintensive mechanization fertilizers and pesticides the vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources between the 1960s and the 1980s the green revolution transformed agriculture around the globe with world grain production increasing significantly between 70 and 390 for wheat and 60 to 150 for rice depending on geographic area as world population doubled heavy reliance on petrochemicals has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output industrialized agriculture depends on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways direct consumption on the farm and manufacture of inputs used on the farm direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery indirect consumption includes the manufacture of fertilizers pesticides and farm machinery in particular the production of nitrogen fertilizer can account for over half of agricultural energy usage together direct and indirect consumption by us farms accounts for about 2 of the nations energy use direct and indirect energy consumption by us farms peaked in 1979 and has since gradually declined food systems encompass not just agriculture but offfarm processing packaging transporting marketing consumption and disposal of food and foodrelated items agriculture accounts for less than onefifth of food system energy use in the us plastic pollution plastic products are used extensively in agriculture including to increase crop yields and improve the efficiency of water and agrichemical use agriplastic products include films to cover greenhouses and tunnels mulch to cover soil eg to suppress weeds conserve water increase soil temperature and aid fertilizer application shade cloth pesticide containers seedling trays protective mesh and irrigation tubing the polymers most commonly used in these products are low density polyethylene lpde linear lowdensity polyethylene lldpe polypropylene pp and polyvinyl chloride pvc the total amount of plastics used in agriculture is difficult to quantify a 2012 study reported that almost 65 million tonnes per year were consumed globally while a later study estimated that global demand in 2015 was between 73 million and 9 million tonnes widespread use of plastic mulch and lack of systematic collection and management have led to the generation of large amounts of mulch residue weathering and degradation eventually cause the mulch to fragment these fragments and larger pieces of plastic accumulate in soil mulch residue has been measured at levels of 50 to 260 kg per hectare in topsoil in areas where mulch use dates back more than 10 years which confirms that mulching is a major source of both microplastic and macroplastic soil contamination agricultural plastics especially plastic films are not easy to recycle because of high contamination levels up to 4050 by weight contamination by pesticides fertilizers soil and debris moist vegetation silage juice water and uv stabilizers and collection difficulties  therefore they are often buried or abandoned in fields and watercourses or burned these disposal practices lead to soil degradation and can result in contamination of soils and leakage of microplastics into the marine environment as a result of precipitation runoff and tidal washing in addition additives in residual plastic film such as uv and thermal stabilizers may have deleterious effects on crop growth soil structure nutrient transport and salt levels there is a risk that plastic mulch will deteriorate soil quality deplete soil organic matter stocks increase soil water repellence and emit greenhouse gases microplastics released through fragmentation of agricultural plastics can absorb and concentrate contaminants capable of being passed up the trophic chain disciplines agricultural economics agricultural economics is economics as it relates to the production distribution and consumption of agricultural goods and services combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing and business as a discipline of study began in the late 1800s and grew significantly through the 20th century although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent major trends in agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history ranging from tenant farmers and sharecropping in the postamerican civil war southern united states to the european feudal system of manorialism in the united states and elsewhere food costs attributed to food processing distribution and agricultural marketing sometimes referred to as the value chain have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined this is related to the greater efficiency of farming combined with the increased level of value addition eg more highly processed products provided by the supply chain market concentration has increased in the sector as well and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers farmers and consumers and may have negative implications for rural communities national government policies such as taxation subsidies tariffs and others can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products since at least the 1960s a combination of trade restrictions exchange rate policies and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and the developed world in the 1980s nonsubsidized farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products between the mid1980s and the early 2000s several international agreements limited agricultural tariffs subsidies and other trade restrictions however 2009 there was still a significant amount of policydriven distortion in global agricultural product prices the three agricultural products with the most trade distortion were sugar milk and rice mainly due to taxation among the oilseeds sesame had the most taxation but overall feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products since the 1980s policydriven distortions have decreases more among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy despite this progress certain crops such as cotton still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices causing hardship in developing countries with nonsubsidized farmers unprocessed commodities such as corn soybeans and cattle are generally graded to indicate quality affecting the price the producer receives commodities are generally reported by production quantities such as volume number or weight agricultural science agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact natural economic and social sciences used in the practice and understanding of agriculture it covers topics such as agronomy plant breeding and genetics plant pathology crop modelling soil science entomology production techniques and improvement study of pests and their management and study of adverse environmental effects such as soil degradation waste management and bioremediation the scientific study of agriculture began in the 18th century when johann friedrich mayer conducted experiments on the use of gypsum hydrated calcium sulphate as a fertilizer research became more systematic when in 1843 john lawes and henry gilbert began a set of longterm agronomy field experiments at rothamsted research station in england some of them such as the park grass experiment are still running in america the hatch act of 1887 provided funding for what it was the first to call agricultural science driven by farmers interest in fertilizers in agricultural entomology the usda began to research biological control in 1881 it instituted its first large program in 1905 searching europe and japan for natural enemies of the spongy moth and browntail moth establishing parasitoids such as solitary wasps and predators of both pests in the us policy agricultural policy is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment including policies related to climate change food safety and natural disasters economic stability including policies related to taxes natural resources and environmental sustainability especially water policy research and development and market access for domestic commodities including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries agricultural policy can also touch on food quality ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality food security ensuring that the food supply meets the populations needs and conservation policy programs can range from financial programs such as subsidies to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs a 2021 report finds that globally support to agricultural producers accounts for almost us540 billion a year this amounts to 15 percent of total agricultural production value and is heavily biased towards measures that are leading to inefficiency as well as are unequally distributed and harmful for the environment and human health there are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy including consumers agribusiness trade lobbies and other groups agribusiness interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making in the form of lobbying and campaign contributions political action groups including those interested in environmental issues and labor unions also provide influence as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements samuel jutzi director of faos animal production and health division states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment for example proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health and environmental regulations such as the number of animals an area of land can support without longterm damage were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure see also references

royal society of literature in 1962 huxley was a pacifist he grew interested in philosophical mysticism as well as universalism addressing these subjects in his works such as the perennial philosophy 1945 which illustrates commonalities between western and eastern mysticism and the doors of perception 1954 which interprets his own psychedelic experience with mescaline in his most famous novel brave new world 1932 and his final novel island 1962 he presented his visions of dystopia and utopia respectively early life huxley was born in godalming surrey england in 1894 he was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster leonard huxley who edited the cornhill magazine and his first wife julia arnold who founded priors field school julia was the niece of poet and critic matthew arnold and the sister of mrs humphry ward julia named him aldous after a character in one of her sisters novels aldous was the grandson of thomas henry huxley the zoologist agnostic and controversialist who had often been called darwins bulldog his brother julian huxley and halfbrother andrew huxley also became outstanding biologists aldous had another brother noel trevenen huxley 18891914 who took his own life after a period of clinical depression as a child huxleys nickname was ogie short for ogre he was described by his brother julian as someone who frequently contemplated the strangeness of things according to his cousin and contemporary gervas huxley he had an early interest in drawing huxleys education began in his fathers wellequipped botanical laboratory after which he enrolled at hillside school near godalming he was taught there by his own mother for several years until she became terminally ill after hillside he went on to eton college his mother died in 1908 when he was 14 his father later remarried aldous huxley eye diseasehe contracted the eye disease keratitis punctata in 1911 this left him practically blind for two to three years and ended his early dreams of becoming a doctor in october 1913 huxley entered balliol college oxford where he studied english literature he volunteered for the british army in january 1916 for the great war however he was rejected on health grounds being halfblind in one eye his eyesight later partly recovered he edited oxford poetry in 1916 and in june of that year graduated ba with first class honours his brother julian wrote following his years at balliol huxley being financially indebted to his father decided to find employment he taught french for a year at eton college where eric blair who was to take the pen name george orwell and steven runciman were among his pupils he was mainly remembered as being an incompetent schoolmaster unable to keep order in class nevertheless blair and others spoke highly of his excellent command of language huxley also worked for a time during the 1920s at brunner and mond an advanced chemical plant in billingham in county durham northeast england according to an introduction to his science fiction novel brave new world 1932 the experience he had there of an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence was an important source for the novel career huxley completed his first unpublished novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early twenties establishing himself as a successful writer and social satirist his first published novels were social satires crome yellow 1921 antic hay 1923 those barren leaves 1925 and point counter point 1928 brave new world 1932 was his fifth novel and first dystopian work in the 1920s he was also a contributor to vanity fair and british vogue magazines contact with the bloomsbury set during the first world war huxley spent much of his time at garsington manor near oxford home of lady ottoline morrell working as a farm labourer while at the manor he met several bloomsbury group figures including bertrand russell alfred north whitehead and clive bell later in crome yellow 1921 he caricatured the garsington lifestyle jobs were very scarce but in 1919 john middleton murry was reorganising the athenaeum and invited huxley to join the staff he accepted immediately and quickly married the belgian refugee maria nys 18991955 also at garsington they lived with their young son in italy part of the time during the 1920s where huxley would visit his friend d h lawrence following lawrences death in 1930 he and maria were present at his death in provence huxley edited lawrences letters 1932 very early in 1929 in london huxley met gerald heard a writer and broadcaster philosopher and interpreter of contemporary science works of this period included novels about the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress his magnum opus brave new world and on pacifist themes eyeless in gaza in brave new world set in a dystopian london huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and pavlovian conditioning huxley was strongly influenced by f matthias alexander on whom he based a character in eyeless in gaza during this period huxley began to write and edit nonfiction works on pacifist issues including ends and means 1937 an encyclopedia of pacifism and pacifism and philosophy and was an active member of the peace pledge union life in the united states in 1937 huxley moved to hollywood with his wife maria son matthew huxley and friend gerald heard cyril connolly wrote of the two intellectuals huxley and heard in the late 1930s all european avenues had been exhausted in the search for a way forward  politics art science  pitching them both toward the us in 1937 huxley lived in the us mainly southern california until his death and for a time in taos new mexico where he wrote ends and means 1937 the book contains tracts on war inequality religion and ethics heard introduced huxley to vedanta upanishadcentered philosophy meditation and vegetarianism through the principle of ahimsa in 1938 huxley befriended jiddu krishnamurti whose teachings he greatly admired huxley and krishnamurti entered into an enduring exchange sometimes edging on debate over many years with krishnamurti representing the more rarefied detached ivorytower perspective and huxley with his pragmatic concerns the more socially and historically informed position huxley wrote a foreword to krishnamurtis quintessential statement the first and last freedom 1954 huxley became a vedantist in the group formed around hindu swami prabhavananda and subsequently introduced christopher isherwood to the circle not long afterwards huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas the perennial philosophy which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world huxley became a close friend of remsen bird president of occidental college he spent much time at the college in the eagle rock neighbourhood of los angeles the college appears as tarzana college in his satirical novel after many a summer 1939 the novel won huxley a british literary award the 1939 james tait black memorial prize for fiction huxley also incorporated bird into the novel during this period huxley earned a substantial income as a hollywood screenwriter christopher isherwood in his autobiography my guru and his disciple states that huxley earned more than 3000 per week approximately 50000 in 2020 dollars as a screenwriter and that he used much of it to transport jewish and leftwing writer and artist refugees from hitlers germany to the us in march 1938 huxleys friend anita loos a novelist and screenwriter put him in touch with metrogoldwynmayer mgm which hired him for madame curie which was originally to star greta garbo and be directed by george cukor eventually the film was completed by mgm in 1943 with a different director and cast huxley received screen credit for pride and prejudice 1940 and was paid for his work on a number of other films including jane eyre 1944 he was commissioned by walt disney in 1945 to write a script based on alices adventures in wonderland and the biography of the storys author lewis carroll the script was not used however huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of j d unwins 1940 book hopousia or the sexual and economic foundations of a new society on 21 october 1949 huxley wrote to george orwell author of nineteen eightyfour congratulating him on how fine and how profoundly important the book is in his letter he predicted in 1953 huxley and maria applied for united states citizenship and presented themselves for examination when huxley refused to bear arms for the us and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals the only excuse allowed under the mccarran act the judge had to adjourn the proceedings he withdrew his application nevertheless he remained in the us in 1959 huxley turned down an offer to be made a knight bachelor by the macmillan government without giving a reason his brother julian had been knighted in 1958 while his brother andrew would be knighted in 1974 in the fall semester of 1960 huxley was invited by professor huston smith to be the carnegie visiting professor of humanities at the massachusetts institute of technology mit as part of the mit centennial program of events organised by the department of humanities huxley presented a series of lectures titled what a piece of work is a man which concerned history language and art robert s de ropp scientist humanitarian and author who had spent time with huxley in england in the 1930s connected with him again in the us in the early 1960s and wrote that the enormous intellect the beautifully modulated voice the gentle objectivity all were unchanged he was one of the most highly civilized human beings i had ever met lateinlife perspectives biographer harold h watts wrote that huxleys writings in the final and extended period of his life are the work of a man who is meditating on the central problems of many modern men huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself from these he made some warnings in his writings and talks in a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist mike wallace huxley outlined several major concerns the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation the tendency towards distinctly hierarchical social organisation the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to persuasion the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as wellmarketed commodities in a december 1962 letter to brother julian summarizing a paper he had presented in santa barbara he wrote what i said was that if we didnt pretty quickly start thinking of human problems in ecological terms rather than in terms of power politics we should very soon be in a bad way huxleys engagement with eastern wisdom traditions was entirely compatible with a strong appreciation of modern science biographer milton birnbaum wrote that huxley ended by embracing both science and eastern religion in his last book literature and science huxley wrote that the ethical and philosophical implications of modern science are more buddhist than christian in a philosophers visionary prediction published one month before he died huxley endorsed training in general semantics and the nonverbal world of culturally uncontaminated consciousness writing that we must learn how to be mentally silent we must cultivate the art of pure receptivity the individual must learn to decondition himself must be able to cut holes in the fence of verbalized symbols that hems him in association with vedanta beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963 huxley had an extensive association with the vedanta society of southern california founded and headed by swami prabhavananda together with gerald heard christopher isherwood and other followers he was initiated by the swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices in 1944 huxley wrote the introduction to the bhagavad gita  the song of god translated by swami prabhavananda and christopher isherwood which was published by the vedanta society of southern california from 1941 until 1960 huxley contributed 48 articles to vedanta and the west published by the society he also served on the editorial board with isherwood heard and playwright john van druten from 1951 through 1962 huxley also occasionally lectured at the hollywood and santa barbara vedanta temples two of those lectures have been released on cd knowledge and understanding and who are we from 1955 nonetheless huxleys agnosticism together with his speculative propensity made it difficult for him to fully embrace any form of institutionalised religion psychedelic drug use and mystical experiences in early 1953 huxley had his first experience with the psychedelic drug mescaline huxley had initiated a correspondence with doctor humphry osmond a british psychiatrist then employed in a canadian institution and eventually asked him to supply a dose of mescaline osmond obliged and supervised huxleys session in southern california after the publication of the doors of perception in which he recounted this experience huxley and swami prabhavananda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psychedelic drug experience which may have caused the relationship to cool but huxley continued to write articles for the societys journal lecture at the temple and attend social functions huxley later had an experience on mescaline that he considered more profound than those detailed in the doors of perception huxley wrote that the mystical experience is doubly valuable it is valuable because it gives the experiencer a better understanding of himself and the world and because it may help him to lead a less selfcentered and more creative life having tried lsd in the 1950s he became an advisor to timothy leary and richard alpert in their early1960s research work with psychedelic drugs at harvard personality differences led huxley to distance himself from leary when huxley grew concerned that leary had become too keen on promoting the drugs rather indiscriminately even playing the rebel with a fondness for publicity eyesight differing accounts exist about the details of the quality of huxleys eyesight at specific points in his life circa 1939 huxley encountered the bates method in which he was instructed by margaret darst corbett in 1940 huxley relocated from hollywood to a 40 ranchito in the high desert hamlet of llano california in northern los angeles county huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the bates method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern american desert he reported that for the first time in more than 25 years he was able to read without glasses and without strain he even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch he wrote a book about his experiences with the bates method the art of seeing which was published in 1942 us 1943 uk the book contained some generally disputed theories and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about huxleys eyesight it was and is widely believed that huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at oxford for example some ten years after publication of the art of seeing in 1952 bennett cerf was present when huxley spoke at a hollywood banquet wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty then suddenly he falteredand the disturbing truth became obvious he wasnt reading his address at all he had learned it by heart to refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes when it was only an inch or so away he still couldnt read it and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him it was an agonising moment brazilian author joão ubaldo ribeiro who as a young journalist spent several evenings in the huxleys company in the late 1950s wrote that huxley had said to him with a wry smile i can hardly see at all and i dont give a damn really on the other hand huxleys second wife laura later emphasised in her biographical account this timeless moment one of the great achievements of his life that of having regained his sight after revealing a letter she wrote to the los angeles times disclaiming the label of huxley as a poor fellow who can hardly see by walter c alvarez she tempered her statement although i feel it was an injustice to treat aldous as though he were blind it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision for instance although aldous did not wear glasses he would quite often use a magnifying lens laura huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to huxleys vision her account in this respect agrees with the following sample of huxleys own words from the art of seeing the most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism or any part of the organism is that it is not constant but highly variable nevertheless the topic of huxleys eyesight has continued to endure similar significant controversy american popular science author steven johnson in his book mind wide open quotes huxley about his difficulties with visual encoding i am and for as long as i can remember i have always been a poor visualizer words even the pregnant words of poets do not evoke pictures in my mind no hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep when i recall something the memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event or object by an effort of the will i can evoke a not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon  personal life huxley married on 10 july 1919 maria nys 10 september 1899  12 february 1955 a belgian epidemiologist from bellem a village near aalter he met at garsington oxfordshire in 1919 they had one child matthew huxley 19 april 1920  10 february 2005 who had a career as an author anthropologist and prominent epidemiologist in 1955 maria huxley died of cancer in 1956 huxley married laura archera 19112007 also an author as well as a violinist and psychotherapist she wrote this timeless moment a biography of huxley she told the story of their marriage through mary ann braubachs 2010 documentary huxley on huxley huxley was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in 1960 in the years that followed with his health deteriorating he wrote the utopian novel island and gave lectures on human potentialities both at the ucsf medical center and at the esalen institute these lectures were fundamental to the beginning of the human potential movement huxley was a close friend of jiddu krishnamurti and rosalind rajagopal and was involved in the creation of the happy valley school now besant hill school of happy valley in ojai california the most substantial collection of huxleys few remaining papers following the destruction of most in the 1961 bel air fire is at the library of the university of california los angeles some are also at the stanford university libraries on 9 april 1962 huxley was informed he was elected companion of literature by the royal society of literature the senior literary organisation in britain and he accepted the title via letter on 28 april 1962 the correspondence between huxley and the society is kept at the cambridge university library the society invited huxley to appear at a banquet and give a lecture at somerset house london in june 1963 huxley wrote a draft of the speech he intended to give at the society however his deteriorating health meant he was not able to attend death on his deathbed unable to speak owing to advanced laryngeal cancer huxley made a written request to his wife laura for lsd 100 µg intramuscular according to her account of his death in this timeless moment she obliged with an injection at 1120 am and a second dose an hour later huxley died aged 69 at 520 pm pst on 22 november 1963 media coverage of huxleys death along with that of fellow british author c s lewis was overshadowed by the assassination of john f kennedy on the same day less than seven hours before huxleys death in a 2009 article for new york magazine titled the eclipsed celebrity death club christopher bonanos wrote this coincidence served as the basis for peter kreefts book between heaven and hell a dialog somewhere beyond death with john f kennedy c s lewis  aldous huxley which imagines a conversation among the three men taking place in purgatory following their deaths huxleys memorial service took place in london in december 1963 it was led by his elder brother julian on 27 october 1971 his ashes were interred in the family grave at the watts cemetery home of the watts mortuary chapel in compton guildford surrey england huxley had been a longtime friend of russian composer igor stravinsky who dedicated his last orchestral composition to huxley what became variations aldous huxley in memoriam was begun in july 1963 completed in october 1964 and premiered by the chicago symphony orchestra on 17 april 1965

diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms the name is an informal term for a polyphyletic grouping that includes species from multiple distinct clades included organisms range from unicellular microalgae such as chlorella prototheca and the diatoms to multicellular forms such as the giant kelp a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 in length most are aquatic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types such as stomata xylem and phloem that are found in land plants the largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds while the most complex freshwater forms are the charophyta a division of green algae which includes for example spirogyra and stoneworts algae that are carried by water are plankton specifically phytoplankton algae constitute a polyphyletic group since they do not include a common ancestor and although their plastids seem to have a single origin from cyanobacteria they were acquired in different ways green algae are examples of algae that have primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria diatoms and brown algae are examples of algae with secondary chloroplasts derived from an endosymbiotic red alga algae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies from simple asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants such as the phyllids leaflike structures of bryophytes rhizoids of nonvascular plants and the roots leaves and other organs found in tracheophytes vascular plants most are phototrophic although some are mixotrophic deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy myzotrophy or phagotrophy some unicellular species of green algae many golden algae euglenids dinoflagellates and other algae have become heterotrophs also called colorless or apochlorotic algae sometimes parasitic relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus some other heterotrophic organisms such as the apicomplexans are also derived from cells whose ancestors possessed plastids but are not traditionally considered as algae algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that produce oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria fossilized filamentous algae from the vindhya basin have been dated back to 16 to 17 billion years ago because of the wide range of types of algae they have increasing different industrial and traditional applications in human society traditional seaweed farming practices have existed for thousands of years and have strong traditions in east asia food cultures more modern algaculture applications extend the food traditions for other applications include cattle feed using algae for bioremediation or pollution control transforming sunlight into algae fuels or other chemicals used in industrial processes and in medical and scientific applications a 2020 review found that these applications of algae could play an important role in carbon sequestration in order to mitigate climate change while providing lucrative valueadded products for global economies etymology and study the singular alga is the latin word for seaweed and retains that meaning in english the etymology is obscure although some speculate that it is related to latin algēre be cold no reason is known to associate seaweed with temperature a more likely source is alliga binding entwining the ancient greek word for seaweed was φῦκος phŷkos which could mean either the seaweed probably red algae or a red dye derived from it the latinization fūcus meant primarily the cosmetic rouge the etymology is uncertain but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the biblical פוך pūk paint if not that word itself a cosmetic eyeshadow used by the ancient egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern mediterranean it could be any color black red green or blue the study of algae is most commonly called phycology gre the term algology is falling out of use classifications one definition of algae is that they have chlorophyll as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells on the other hand the colorless prototheca under chlorophyta are all devoid of any chlorophyll although cyanobacteria are often referred to as bluegreen algae most authorities exclude all prokaryotes including cyanobacteria from the definition of algae the algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria chloroplasts contain circular dna like that in cyanobacteria and are interpreted as representing reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria however the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events the table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic some retain plastids but not chloroplasts while others have lost plastids entirely phylogeny based on plastid not nucleocytoplasmic genealogy linnaeus in species plantarum 1753 the starting point for modern botanical nomenclature recognized 14 genera of algae of which only four are currently considered among algae in systema naturae linnaeus described the genera volvox and corallina and a species of acetabularia as madrepora among the animals in 1768 samuel gottlieb gmelin 17441774 published the historia fucorum the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on marine biology to use the then new binomial nomenclature of linnaeus it included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves w h harvey 18111866 and lamouroux 1813 were the first to divide macroscopic algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation this is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics harveys four divisions are red algae rhodospermae brown algae melanospermae green algae chlorospermae and diatomaceae at this time microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers eg o f müller and ehrenberg studying the infusoria microscopic organisms unlike macroalgae which were clearly viewed as plants microalgae were frequently considered animals because they are often motile even the nonmotile coccoid microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the lifecycle of plants macroalgae or animals although used as a taxonomic category in some predarwinian classifications eg linnaeus 1753 de jussieu 1789 horaninow 1843 agassiz 1859 wilson  cassin 1864 in further classifications the algae are seen as an artificial polyphyletic groupaugust 2023 throughout the 20th century most classifications treated the following groups as divisions or classes of algae cyanophytes rhodophytes chrysophytes xanthophytes bacillariophytes phaeophytes pyrrhophytes cryptophytes and dinophytes euglenophytes and chlorophytes later many new groups were discovered eg bolidophyceae and others were splintered from older groups charophytes and glaucophytes from chlorophytes many heterokontophytes eg synurophytes from chrysophytes or eustigmatophytes from xanthophytes haptophytes from chrysophytes and chlorarachniophytes from xanthophytesaugust 2023 with the abandonment of plantanimal dichotomous classification most groups of algae sometimes all were included in protista later also abandoned in favour of eukaryota however as a legacy of the older plant life scheme some groups that were also treated as protozoans in the past still have duplicated classifications see ambiregnal protistsaugust 2023 some parasitic algae eg the green algae prototheca and helicosporidium parasites of metazoans or cephaleuros parasites of plants were originally classified as fungi sporozoans or protistans of incertae sedis while others eg the green algae phyllosiphon and rhodochytrium parasites of plants or the red algae pterocladiophila and gelidiocolax mammillatus parasites of other red algae or the dinoflagellates oodinium parasites of fish had their relationship with algae conjectured early in other cases some groups were originally characterized as parasitic algae eg chlorochytrium but later were seen as endophytic algae some filamentous bacteria eg beggiatoa were originally seen as algae furthermore groups like the apicomplexans are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algaeaugust 2023 evolution algae are polyphyletic thus their origin cannot be traced back to single hypothetical common ancestor it is thought that they came into existence when photosynthetic coccoid cyanobacteria got phagocytized by a unicellular heterotrophic eukaryote a protist giving rise to doublemembranous primary plastids such symbiogenic events primary symbiogenesis are believed to have occurred more than 15 billion years ago during the calymmian period early in boring billion but it is difficult to track the key events because of so much time gap primary symbiogenesis gave rise to three divisions of archaeplastids namely the viridiplantae green algae and later plants rhodophyta red algae and glaucophyta grey algae whose plastids further spread into other protist lineages through eukaryoteeukaryote predation engulfments and subsequent endosymbioses secondary and tertiary symbiogenesis this process of serial cell capture and enslavement explains the diversity of photosynthetic eukaryotes recent genomic and phylogenomic approaches have significantly clarified plastid genome evolution the horizontal movement of endosymbiont genes to the host nuclear genome and plastid spread throughout the eukaryotic tree of life relationship to land plants fossils of isolated spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475 million years ago mya during the late cambrianearly ordovician period from sessile shallow freshwater charophyte algae much like chara which likely got stranded ashore when riverinelacustrine water levels dropped during dry seasons these charophyte algae probably already developed filamentous thalli and holdfasts that superficially resembled plant stems and roots and probably had an isomorphic alternation of generations they perhaps evolved some 850 mya and might even be as early as 1 gya during the late phase of the boring billion morphology a range of algal morphologies is exhibited and convergence of features in unrelated groups is common the only groups to exhibit threedimensional multicellular thalli are the reds and browns and some chlorophytes apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups the florideophyte reds various browns and the charophytes the form of charophytes is quite different from those of reds and browns because they have distinct nodes separated by internode stems whorls of branches reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes conceptacles are another polyphyletic trait they appear in the coralline algae and the hildenbrandiales as well as the browns most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids but colonial and nonmotile forms have developed independently among several of the groups some of the more common organizational levels more than one of which may occur in the lifecycle of a species are in three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached with full tissue differentiation these are the brown algaesome of which may reach 50 m in length kelpsthe red algae and the green algae the most complex forms are found among the charophyte algae see charales and charophyta in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants the innovation that defines these nonalgal plants is the presence of female reproductive organs with protective cell layers that protect the zygote and developing embryo hence the land plants are referred to as the embryophytes turfs the term algal turf is commonly used but poorly defined algal turfs are thick carpetlike beds of seaweed that retain sediment and compete with foundation species like corals and kelps and they are usually less than 15 cm tall such a turf may consist of one or more species and will generally cover an area in the order of a square metre or more some common characteristics are listed physiology many algae particularly species of the characeae have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes osmoregulation turgor regulationhow is turgor regulation distinct from osmoregulation salt tolerance cytoplasmic streaming and the generation of action potentials phytohormones are found not only in higher plants but in algae too symbiotic algae some species of algae form symbiotic relationships with other organisms in these symbioses the algae supply photosynthates organic substances to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells the host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae examples are lichens lichens are defined by the international association for lichenology to be an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure the fungi or mycobionts are mainly from the ascomycota with a few from the basidiomycota in nature they do not occur separate from lichens it is unknown when they began to associate one mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species rarely two from the green algae except that alternatively the mycobiont may associate with a species of cyanobacteria hence photobiont is the more accurate term a photobiont may be associated with many different mycobionts or may live independently accordingly lichens are named and classified as fungal species the association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone they can be experimentally isolated the photobiont possibly triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont trentepohlia is an example of a common green alga genus worldwide that can grow on its own or be lichenised lichen thus share some of the habitat and often similar appearance with specialized species of algae aerophytes growing on exposed surfaces such as tree trunks and rocks and sometimes discoloring them coral reefs coral reefs are accumulated from the calcareous exoskeletons of marine invertebrates of the order scleractinia stony corals these animals metabolize sugar and oxygen to obtain energy for their cellbuilding processes including secretion of the exoskeleton with water and carbon dioxide as byproducts dinoflagellates algal protists are often endosymbionts in the cells of the coralforming marine invertebrates where they accelerate hostcell metabolism by generating sugar and oxygen immediately available through photosynthesis using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host reefbuilding stony corals hermatypic corals require endosymbiotic algae from the genus symbiodinium to be in a healthy condition the loss of symbiodinium from the host is known as coral bleaching a condition which leads to the deterioration of a reef sea sponges endosymbiontic green algae live close to the surface of some sponges for example breadcrumb sponges halichondria panicea the alga is thus protected from predators the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80 of sponge growth in some species life cycle rhodophyta chlorophyta and heterokontophyta the three main algal divisions have life cycles which show considerable variation and complexity in general an asexual phase exists where the seaweeds cells are diploid a sexual phase where the cells are haploid followed by fusion of the male and female gametes asexual reproduction permits efficient population increases but less variation is possible commonly in sexual reproduction of unicellular and colonial algae two specialized sexually compatible haploid gametes make physical contact and fuse to form a zygote to ensure a successful mating the development and release of gametes is highly synchronized and regulated pheromones may play a key role in these processes sexual reproduction allows for more variation and provides the benefit of efficient recombinational repair of dna damages during meiosis a key stage of the sexual cycle however sexual reproduction is more costly than asexual reproduction meiosis has been shown to occur in many different species of algae numbers the algal collection of the us national herbarium located in the national museum of natural history consists of approximately 320500 dried specimens which although not exhaustive no exhaustive collection exists gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species that number remains unknown estimates vary widely for example according to one standard textbook in the british isles the uk biodiversity steering group report estimated there to be 20000 algal species in the uk another checklist reports only about 5000 species regarding the difference of about 15000 species the text concludes it will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species  regional and group estimates have been made as well and so on but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources these numbers have no more credibility than the british ones mentioned above most estimates also omit microscopic algae such as phytoplankton the most recent estimate suggests 72500 algal species worldwide distribution the distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the mid19th century algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of plantae by seeds and spores this dispersal can be accomplished by air water or other organisms due to this spores can be found in a variety of environments fresh and marine waters air soil and in or on other organisms whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands the spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind as well as by living carriers however not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them marine spores are often spread by ocean currents ocean water presents many vastly different habitats based on temperature and nutrient availability resulting in phytogeographic zones regions and provinces to some degree the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features such as antarctica long distances of ocean or general land masses it is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality such as pacific algae or north sea algae when they occur out of their localities hypothesizing a transport mechanism is usually possible such as the hulls of ships for example ulva reticulata and u fasciata travelled from the mainland to hawaii in this manner mapping is possible for select species only there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns for example clathromorphum is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there however scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the difficulties of undertaking such studies ecology algae are prominent in bodies of water common in terrestrial environments and are found in unusual environments such as on snow and ice seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters under 100 deep however some such as navicula pennata have been recorded to a depth of 360 a type of algae ancylonema nordenskioeldii was found in greenland in areas known as the dark zone which caused an increase in the rate of melting ice sheet same algae was found in the italian alps after pink ice appeared on parts of the presena glacier the various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column phytoplankton provide the food base for most marine food chains in very high densities algal blooms these algae may discolor the water and outcompete poison or asphyxiate other life forms algae can be used as indicator organisms to monitor pollution in various aquatic systems in many cases algal metabolism is sensitive to various pollutants due to this the species composition of algal populations may shift in the presence of chemical pollutants to detect these changes algae can be sampled from the environment and maintained in laboratories with relative ease on the basis of their habitat algae can be categorized as aquatic planktonic benthic marine freshwater lentic lotic terrestrial aerial subaerial lithophytic halophytic or euryhaline psammon thermophilic cryophilic epibiont epiphytic epizoic endosymbiont endophytic endozoic parasitic calcifilic or lichenic phycobiont cultural associations in classical chinese the word 藻 is used both for algae and in the modest tradition of the imperial scholars for literary talent the third island in kunming lake beside the summer palace in beijing is known as the zaojian tang dao 藻鑒堂島 which thus simultaneously means island of the algaeviewing hall and island of the hall for reflecting on literary talent cultivation seaweed farming bioreactors uses agar agar a gelatinous

16th century referring to drift weed in south wales today algae are used by humans in many ways for example as fertilizers soil conditioners and livestock feed aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds algaculture on a large scale is an important type of aquaculture in some places maerl is commonly used as a soil conditioner nutrition naturally growing seaweeds are an important source of food especially in asia leading some to label them as superfoods they provide many vitamins including a b1 b2 b6 niacin and c and are rich in iodine potassium iron magnesium and calcium in addition commercially cultivated microalgae including both algae and cyanobacteria are marketed as nutritional supplements such as spirulina chlorella and the vitaminc supplement from dunaliella high in betacarotene algae are national foods of many nations china consumes more than 70 species

furthermore it contains all nine of the essential amino acids the body does not produce on its own the oils from some algae have high levels of unsaturated fatty acids for example parietochloris incisa is high in arachidonic acid where it reaches up to 47 of the triglyceride pool some varieties of algae favored by vegetarianism and veganism contain the longchain essential omega3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid dha and eicosapentaenoic acid epa fish oil contains the omega3 fatty acids but the original source is algae microalgae in particular which are eaten by marine life such as copepods and are passed up the food chain algae have emerged in recent years as a popular source of omega3 fatty acids for vegetarians who cannot get longchain epa and dha from other vegetarian sources such as flaxseed oil which only contains the shortchain alphalinolenic acid ala pollution control agricultural research service scientists found that 6090 of nitrogen runoff and 70100 of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using a horizontal algae scrubber also called an algal turf scrubber ats scientists developed the ats which consists of shallow 100foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form and studied its efficacy for three years they found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers streams and oceans researchers collected and dried the nutrientrich algae from the ats and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer they found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ats organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers algae scrubbers using bubbling upflow or vertical waterfall versions are now also being used to filter aquaria and ponds polymers various polymers can be created from algae which can be especially useful in the creation of bioplastics these include hybrid plastics cellulosebased

bacillaris has been seen to colonize silicone resins used at archaeological sites biodegrading the synthetic substance pigments the natural pigments carotenoids and chlorophylls produced by algae can

analysis of variance design of experiments statistical tests parametric statistics analysis of variance anova is a collection of statistical models and their associated estimation procedures such as the variation among and between groups used to analyze the differences among means anova was developed by the statistician ronald fisher anova is based on the law of total variance where the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation in its simplest form anova provides a statistical test of whether two or more population means are equal and therefore generalizes the ttest beyond two means in other words the anova is used to test the difference between two or more means history while the analysis of variance reached fruition in the 20th century antecedents extend centuries into the past according to stigler these include hypothesis testing the partitioning of sums of squares experimental techniques and the additive model laplace was performing hypothesis testing in the 1770s around 1800 laplace and gauss developed the leastsquares method for combining observations which improved upon methods then used in astronomy and geodesy it also initiated much study of the contributions to sums of squares laplace knew how to estimate a variance from a residual rather than a total sum of squares by 1827 laplace was using least squares methods to address anova problems regarding measurements of atmospheric tides before 1800 astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting from reaction times the personal equation and had developed methods of reducing the errors the experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation were later accepted by the emerging field of psychology which developed strong full factorial experimental methods to which randomization and blinding were soon added an eloquent nonmathematical explanation of the additive effects model was available in 1885 ronald fisher introduced the term variance and proposed its formal analysis in a 1918 article on theoretical population geneticsthe correlation between relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritance his first application of the analysis of variance to data analysis was published in 1921 studies in crop variation i this divided the variation of a time series into components representing annual causes and slow deterioration fishers next piece studies in crop variation ii written with winifred mackenzie and published in 1923 studied the variation in yield across plots sown with different varieties and subjected to different fertiliser treatments analysis of variance became widely known after being included in fishers 1925 book statistical methods for research workers randomization models were developed by several researchers the first was published in polish by jerzy neyman in 1923 example the analysis of variance can be used to describe otherwise complex relations among variables a dog show provides an example a dog show is not a random sampling of the breed it is typically limited to dogs that are adult purebred and exemplary a histogram of dog weights from a show might plausibly be rather complex like the yelloworange distribution shown in the illustrations suppose we wanted to predict the weight of a dog based on a certain set of characteristics of each dog one way to do that is to explain the distribution of weights by dividing the dog population into groups based on those characteristics a successful grouping will split dogs such that a each group has a low variance of dog weights meaning the group is relatively homogeneous and b the mean of each group is distinct if two groups have the same mean then it isnt reasonable to conclude that the groups are in fact separate in any meaningful way in the illustrations to the right groups are identified as x1 x2 etc in the first illustration the dogs are divided according to the product interaction of two binary groupings young vs old and shorthaired vs longhaired eg group 1 is young shorthaired dogs group 2 is young longhaired dogs etc since the distributions of dog weight within each of the groups shown in blue has a relatively large variance and since the means are very similar across groups grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in dog weights knowing which group a dog is in doesnt allow us to predict its weight much better than simply knowing the dog is in a dog show thus this grouping fails to explain the variation in the overall distribution yelloworange an attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as pet vs working breed and less athletic vs more athletic would probably be somewhat more successful fair fit the heaviest show dogs are likely to be big strong working breeds while breeds kept as pets tend to be smaller and thus lighter as shown by the second illustration the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the first case and the means are more distinguishable however the significant overlap of distributions for example means that we cannot distinguish x1 and x2 reliably grouping dogs according to a coin flip might produce distributions that look similar an attempt to explain weight by breed is likely to produce a very good fit all chihuahuas are light and all st bernards are heavy the difference in weights between setters and pointers does not justify separate breeds the analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments a common use of the method is the analysis of experimental data or the development of models the method has some advantages over correlation not all of the data must be numeric and one result of the method is a judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship classes of models there are three classes of models used in the analysis of variance and these are outlined here fixedeffects models the fixedeffects model class i of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see whether the response variable values change this allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole randomeffects models randomeffects model class ii is used when the treatments are not fixed this occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population because the levels themselves are random variables some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments a multivariable generalization of simple differences differ from the fixedeffects model mixedeffects models a mixedeffects model class iii contains experimental factors of both fixed and randomeffects types with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types example teaching experiments could be performed by a college or university department to find a good introductory textbook with each text considered a treatment the fixedeffects model would compare a list of candidate texts the randomeffects model would determine whether important differences exist among a list of randomly selected texts the mixedeffects model would compare the fixed incumbent texts to randomly selected alternatives defining fixed and random effects has proven elusive with multiple competing definitions assumptions the analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches the most common of which uses a linear model that relates the response to the treatments and blocks note that the model is linear in parameters but may be nonlinear across factor levels interpretation is easy when data is balanced across factors but much deeper understanding is needed for unbalanced data textbook analysis using a normal distribution the analysis of variance can be presented in terms of a linear model which makes the following assumptions about the probability distribution of the responses randomizationbased analysis in a randomized controlled experiment the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units following the experimental protocol this randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out the objective randomassignment is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis following the ideas of c s peirce and ronald fisher this designbased analysis was discussed and developed by francis j anscombe at rothamsted experimental station and by oscar kempthorne at iowa state university kempthorne and his students make an assumption of unit treatment additivity which is discussed in the books of kempthorne and david r cox unittreatment additivity the assumption of unit treatment additivity usually cannot be directly falsified according to cox and kempthorne however many consequences of treatmentunit additivity can be falsified for a randomized experiment the assumption of unittreatment additivity implies that the variance is constant for all treatments therefore by contraposition a necessary condition for unittreatment additivity is that the variance is constant the use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the designbased inference that is standard in finitepopulation survey sampling derived linear model kempthorne uses the randomizationdistribution and the assumption of unit treatment additivity to produce a derived linear model very similar to the textbook model discussed previously the test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model according to approximation theorems and simulation studies however there are differences for example the randomizationbased analysis results in a small but strictly negative correlation between the observations in the randomizationbased analysis there is no assumption of a normal distribution and certainly no assumption of independence on the contrary the observations are dependent the randomizationbased analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious algebra and extensive time since the randomizationbased analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using a normal linear model most teachers emphasize the normal linear model approach few statisticians object to modelbased analysis of balanced randomized experiments statistical models for observational data however when applied to data from nonrandomized experiments or observational studies modelbased analysis lacks the warrant of randomization for observational data the derivation of confidence intervals must use subjective models as emphasized by ronald fisher and his followers in practice the estimates of treatmenteffects from observational studies generally are often inconsistent in practice statistical models and observational data are useful for suggesting hypotheses that should be treated very cautiously by the public summary of assumptions the normalmodel based anova analysis assumes the independence normality and homogeneity of variances of the residuals the randomizationbased analysis assumes only the homogeneity of the variances of the residuals as a consequence of unittreatment additivity and uses the randomization procedure of the experiment both these analyses require homoscedasticity as an assumption for the normalmodel analysis and as a consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomizationbased analysis however studies of processes that change variances rather than means called dispersion effects have been successfully conducted using anova there are no necessary assumptions for anova in its full generality but the ftest used for anova hypothesis testing has assumptions and practical limitations which are of continuing interest problems which do not satisfy the assumptions of anova can often be transformed to satisfy the assumptions the property of unittreatment additivity is not invariant under a change of scale so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unittreatment additivity if the response variable is expected to follow a parametric family of probability distributions then the statistician may specify in the protocol for the experiment or observational study that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variance also a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses which are believed to follow a multiplicative model according to cauchys functional equation theorem the logarithm is the only continuous transformation that transforms real multiplication to additionoctober 2013 characteristics anova is used in the analysis of comparative experiments those in which only the difference in outcomes is of interest the statistical significance of the experiment is determined by a ratio of two variances this ratio is independent of several possible alterations to the experimental observations adding a constant to all observations does not alter significance multiplying all observations by a constant does not alter significance so anova statistical significance result is independent of constant bias and scaling errors as well as the units used in expressing observations in the era of mechanical calculation it was common to subtract a constant from all observations when equivalent to dropping leading digits to simplify data entry this is an example of data coding algorithm the calculations of anova can be characterized as computing a number of means and variances dividing two variances and comparing the ratio to a handbook value to determine statistical significance calculating a treatment effect is then trivial the effect of any treatment is estimated by taking the difference between the mean of the observations which receive the treatment and the general mean partitioning of the sum of squares the sum of squares ss the result is called the mean square ms and the squared terms are deviations from the sample mean anova estimates 3 sample variances a total variance based on all the observation deviations from the grand mean an error variance based on all the observation deviations from their appropriate treatment means and a treatment variance the treatment variance is based on the deviations of treatment means from the grand mean the result being multiplied by the number of observations in each treatment to account for the difference between the variance of observations and the variance of means the fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total sum of squares ss into components related to the effects used in the model for example the model for a simplified anova with one type of treatment at different levels the number of degrees of freedom df can be partitioned in a similar way one of these components that for error specifies a chisquared distribution which describes the associated sum of squares while the same is true for treatments if there is no treatment effect the ftest the ftest is used for comparing the factors of the total deviation for example in oneway or singlefactor anova statistical significance is tested for by comparing the f test statistic there are two methods of concluding the anova hypothesis test both of which produce the same result the anova ftest is known to be nearly optimal in the sense of minimizing false negative errors for a fixed rate of false positive errors ie maximizing power for a fixed significance level for example to test the hypothesis that various medical treatments have exactly the same effect the ftests pvalues closely approximate the permutation tests pvalues the approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced such permutation tests characterize tests with maximum power against all alternative hypotheses as observed by rosenbaum the anova ftest of the nullhypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect is recommended as a practical test because of its robustness against many alternative distributions extended algorithm anova consists of separable parts partitioning sources of variance and hypothesis testing can be used individually anova is used to support other statistical tools regression is first used to fit more complex models to data then anova is used to compare models with the objective of selecting simpler models that adequately describe the data such models could be fit without any reference to anova but anova tools could then be used to make some sense of the fitted models and to test hypotheses about batches of coefficients we think of the analysis of variance as a way of understanding and structuring multilevel modelsnot as an alternative to regression but as a tool for summarizing complex highdimensional inferences  for a single factor the simplest experiment suitable for anova analysis is the completely randomized experiment with a single factor more complex experiments with a single factor involve constraints on randomization and include completely randomized blocks and latin squares and variants graecolatin squares etc the more complex experiments share many of the complexities of multiple factors a relatively complete discussion of the analysis models data summaries anova table of the completely randomized experiment is available there are some alternatives to conventional oneway analysis of variance eg welchs heteroscedastic f test welchs heteroscedastic f test with trimmed means and winsorized variances brownforsythe test alexandergovern test james second order test and kruskalwallis test available in onewaytests r it is useful to represent each data point in the following form called a statistical model where that is we envision an additive model that says every data point can be represented by summing three quantities the true mean averaged over all factor levels being investigated plus an incremental component associated with the particular column factor level plus a final component associated with everything else affecting that specific data value for multiple factors anova generalizes to the study of the effects of multiple factors when the experiment includes observations at all combinations of levels of each factor it is termed factorial factorial experiments are more efficient than a series of single factor experiments and the efficiency grows as the number of factors increases consequently factorial designs are heavily used the use of anova to study the effects of multiple factors has a complication in a 3way anova with factors x y and z the anova model includes terms for the main effects x y z and terms for interactions xy xz yz xyz all terms require hypothesis tests the proliferation of interaction terms increases the risk that some hypothesis test will produce a false positive by chance fortunately experience says that high order interactions are rare december 2014 the ability to detect interactions is a major advantage of multiple factor anova testing one factor at a time hides interactions but produces apparently inconsistent experimental results caution is advised when encountering interactions test interaction terms first and expand the analysis beyond anova if interactions are found texts vary in their recommendations regarding the continuation of the anova procedure after encountering an interaction interactions complicate the interpretation of experimental data neither the calculations of significance nor the estimated treatment effects can be taken at face value a significant interaction will often mask the significance of main effects graphical methods are recommended to enhance understanding regression is often useful a lengthy discussion of interactions is available in cox 1958 some interactions can be removed by transformations while others cannot a variety of techniques are used with multiple factor anova to reduce expense one technique used in factorial designs is to minimize replication possibly no replication with support of analytical trickery and to combine groups when effects are found to be statistically or practically insignificant an experiment with many insignificant factors may collapse into one with a few factors supported by many replications associated analysis some analysis is required in support of the design of the experiment while other analysis is performed after changes in the factors are formally found to produce statistically significant changes in the responses because experimentation is iterative the results of one experiment alter plans for following experiments preparatory analysis the number of experimental units in the design of an experiment the number of experimental units is planned to satisfy the goals of the experiment experimentation is often sequential early experiments are often designed to provide meanunbiased estimates of treatment effects and of experimental error later experiments are often designed to test a hypothesis that a treatment effect has an important magnitude in this case the number of experimental units is chosen so that the experiment is within budget and has adequate power among other goals reporting sample size analysis is generally required in psychology provide information on sample size and the process that led to sample size decisions the analysis which is written in the experimental protocol before the experiment is conducted is examined in grant applications and administrative review boards besides the power analysis there are less formal methods for selecting the number of experimental units these include graphical methods based on limiting the probability of false negative errors graphical methods based on an expected variation increase above the residuals and methods based on achieving a desired confidence interval power analysis power analysis is often applied in the context of anova in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain anova design effect size in the population sample size and significance level power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have a reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true effect size several standardized measures of effect have been proposed for anova to summarize the strength of the association between a predictors and the dependent variable or the overall standardized difference of the complete model standardized effectsize estimates facilitate comparison of findings across studies and disciplines however while standardized effect sizes are commonly used in much of the professional literature a nonstandardized measure of effect size that has immediately meaningful units may be preferable for reporting purposes model confirmation sometimes tests are conducted to determine whether the assumptions of anova appear to be violated residuals are examined or analyzed to confirm homoscedasticity and gross normality residuals should have the appearance of zero mean normal distribution noise when plotted as a function of anything including time and modeled data values trends hint at interactions among factors or among observations followup tests a statistically significant effect in anova is often followed by additional tests this can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses followup tests are often distinguished in terms of whether they are planned a priori or post hoc planned tests are determined before looking at the data and post hoc tests are conceived only after looking at the data though the term post hoc is inconsistently used the followup tests may be simple pairwise comparisons of individual group means or may be compound comparisons eg comparing the mean pooling across groups a b and c to the mean of group d comparisons can also look at tests of trend such as linear and quadratic relationships when the independent variable involves ordered levels often the followup tests incorporate a method of adjusting for the multiple comparisons problem followup tests to identify which specific groups variables or factors have statistically different means include the tukeys range test and duncans new multiple range test in turn these tests are often followed with a compact letter display cld methodology in order to render the output of the mentioned tests more transparent to a nonstatistician audience study designs there are several types of anova many statisticians base anova on the design of the experiment especially on the protocol that specifies the random assignment of treatments to subjects the protocols description of the assignment mechanism should include a specification of the structure of the treatments and of any blocking it is also common to apply anova to observational data using an appropriate statistical model some popular designs use the following types of anova cautions balanced experiments those with an equal sample size for each treatment are relatively easy to interpret unbalanced experiments offer more complexity for singlefactor oneway anova the adjustment for unbalanced data is easy but the unbalanced analysis lacks both robustness and power for more complex designs the lack of balance leads to further complications the orthogonality property of main effects and interactions present in balanced data does not carry over to the unbalanced case this means that the usual analysis of variance techniques do not apply consequently the analysis of unbalanced factorials is much more difficult than that for balanced designs in the general case the analysis of variance can also be applied to unbalanced data but then the sums of squares mean squares and fratios will depend on the order in which the sources of variation are considered anova is in part a test of statistical significance the american psychological association and many other organisations holds the view that simply reporting statistical significance is insufficient and that reporting confidence bounds is preferred generalizations anova is considered to be a special case of linear regression which in turn is a special case of the general linear model all consider the observations to be the sum of a model fit and a residual error to be minimized the kruskalwallis test and the friedman test are nonparametric tests which do not rely on an assumption of normality connection to linear regression below we make clear the connection between multiway anova and linear regression example we can consider the 2way interaction example where we assume that the first factor has 2 levels and the second factor has 3 levels with that where the last term is an intercept term for a more concrete example suppose that see also footnotes notes references further reading external links alkane categories alkanes hydrocarbons in organic chemistry an alkane or paraffin a historical trivial name that also has other meanings is an acyclic saturated hydrocarbon in other words an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a tree structure in which all the carboncarbon bonds are single alkanes have the general chemical formula c_h_ the alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of methane ch4 where n  1 sometimes called the parent molecule to arbitrarily large and complex molecules like pentacontane c50h102 or 6ethyl2methyl51methylethyl octane an isomer of tetradecane c14h30 the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac defines alkanes as acyclic branched or unbranched hydrocarbons having the general formula c_h_ and therefore consisting entirely of hydrogen atoms and saturated carbon atoms however some sources use the term to denote any saturated hydrocarbon including those that are either monocyclic ie the cycloalkanes or polycyclic despite their having a distinct general formula ie cycloalkanes are c_h_ in an alkane each carbon atom is sp3hybridized with 4 sigma bonds either cc or ch and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms in a ch bond the longest series of linked carbon atoms in a molecule is known as its carbon skeleton or carbon backbone the number of carbon atoms may be considered as the size of the alkane one group of the higher alkanes are waxes solids at standard ambient temperature and pressure satp for which the number of carbon atoms in the carbon backbone is greater than about 17 with their repeated ch2 units the alkanes constitute a homologous series of organic compounds in which the members differ in molecular mass by multiples of 1403 u the total mass of each such methylenebridge unit which comprises a single carbon atom of mass 1201 u and two hydrogen atoms of mass 101 u each methane is produced by methanogenic bacteria and some longchain alkanes function as pheromones in certain animal species or as protective waxes in plants and fungi nevertheless most alkanes do not have much biological activity they can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more activereactive functional groups of biological molecules the alkanes have two main commercial sources petroleum crude oil and natural gas an alkyl group is an alkanebased molecular fragment that bears one open valence for bonding they are generally abbreviated with the symbol for any organyl group r although alk is sometimes used to specifically symbolize an alkyl group as opposed to an alkenyl group or aryl group structure and classification ordinarily the cc single bond distance is 153 saturated hydrocarbons can be linear branched or cyclic the third group is sometimes called cycloalkanes very complicated structures are possible by combining linear branch cyclic alkanes isomerism alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in various ways forming structural isomers the simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches this isomer is sometimes called the nisomer n for normal although it is not necessarily the most common however the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points the number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms for example for acyclic alkanes branched alkanes can be chiral for example 3methylhexane and its higher homologues are chiral due to their stereogenic center at carbon atom number 3 the above list only includes differences of connectivity not stereochemistry in addition to the alkane isomers the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more rings such compounds are called cycloalkanes and are also excluded from the above list because changing the number of rings changes the molecular formula for example cyclobutane and methylcyclopropane are isomers of each other c4h8 but are not isomers of butane c4h10 branched alkanes are more thermodynamically stable than their linear or less branched isomers for example the highly branched 2233tetramethylbutane is about 19 kcalmol more stable than its linear isomer noctane nomenclature the iupac nomenclature systematic way of naming compounds for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains unbranched saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix ane in 1866 august wilhelm von hofmann suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a e i o and u to create suffixes ane ene ine or yne one une for the hydrocarbons cnh2n2 cnh2n cnh2n2 cnh2n4 cnh2n6 in modern nomenclature the first three specifically name hydrocarbons with single double and triple bonds while one now represents a ketone linear alkanes straightchain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix n or nfor normal where a nonlinear isomer exists although this is not strictly necessary and is not part of the iupac naming system the usage is still common in cases where one wishes to emphasize or distinguish between the straightchain and branchedchain isomers eg nbutane rather than simply butane to differentiate it from isobutane alternative names for this group used in the petroleum industry are linear paraffins or nparaffins the first eight members of the series in terms of number of carbon atoms are named as follows the first four names were derived from methanol ether propionic acid and butyric acid alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel a or o from the basic numerical term hence pentane c5h12 hexane c6h14 heptane c7h16 octane c8h18 etc the numeral prefix is generally greek however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine for example nonane use the latin prefix non branched alkanes simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes for example npentane isopentane and neopentane iupac naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name the key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows saturated cyclic hydrocarbons though technically distinct from the alkanes this class of hydrocarbons is referred to by some as the cyclic alkanes as their description implies they contain one or more rings simple cycloalkanes have a prefix cyclo to distinguish them from alkanes cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms in their backbones eg cyclopentane c5h10 is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like pentane c5h12 but they are joined up in a fivemembered ring in a similar manner propane and cyclopropane butane and cyclobutane etc substituted cycloalkanes are named similarly to substituted alkanes  the cycloalkane ring is stated and the substituents are according to their position on the ring with the numbering decided by the cahningoldprelog priority rules trivialcommon names the trivial nonsystematic name for alkanes is paraffins together alkanes are known as the paraffin series trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts they were coined before the development of systematic names and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes branchedchain alkanes are called isoparaffins paraffin is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of isomers ie compounds of the same chemical formula eg pentane and isopentane the following trivial names are retained in the iupac system some noniupac trivial names are occasionally used physical properties all alkanes are colorless alkanes with the lowest molecular weights are gases those of intermediate molecular weight are liquids and the heaviest are waxy solids table of alkanes boiling point alkanes experience intermolecular van der waals forces the cumulative effects of these intermolecular forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes two factors influence the strength of the van der waals forces under standard conditions from ch4 to c4h10 alkanes are gaseous from c5h12 to c17h36 they are liquids and after c18h38 they are solids as the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has an almost linear relationship with the size molecular weight of the molecule as a rule of thumb the boiling point rises 2030 c for each carbon added to the chain this rule applies to other homologous series a straightchain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branchedchain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact and thus greater van der waals forces between adjacent molecules for example compare isobutane 2methylpropane and nbutane butane which boil at 12 and 0 c and 22dimethylbutane and 23dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58 c respectively on the other hand cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules which give a plane of intermolecular contact melting points the melting points of the alkanes follow a similar trend to boiling points for the same reason as outlined above that is all other things being equal the larger the molecule the higher the melting point there is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points solids have a more rigid and fixed structure than liquids this rigid structure requires energy to break down thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart for alkanes this can be seen from the graph above ie the blue line the oddnumbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than evennumbered alkanes this is because evennumbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase forming a wellorganized structure which requires more energy to break apart the oddnumbered alkanes pack less well and so the looserorganized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart for a visualization of the crystal structures see the melting points of branchedchain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straightchain alkanes again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase conductivity and solubility alkanes do not conduct electricity in any way nor are they substantially polarized by an electric field for this reason they do not form hydrogen bonds and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order a reduction in entropy as there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water alkanes are said to be hydrophobic as they are insoluble in water their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively high a property that is called lipophilicity alkanes are for example miscible in all proportions among themselves the density of the alkanes usually increases with the number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water hence alkanes form the upper layer in an alkanewater mixture molecular geometry the molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics it is derived from the electron configuration of carbon which has four valence electrons the carbon atoms in alkanes are described as sp3 hybrids that is to say that to a good approximation the valence electrons are in orbitals directed towards the corners of a tetrahedron which are derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals geometrically the angle between the bonds are cos13  10947 this is exact for the case of methane while larger alkanes containing a combination of ch and cc bonds generally have bonds that are within several degrees of this idealized value bond lengths and bond angles an alkane has only ch and cc single bonds the former result from the overlap of an sp3 orbital of carbon with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen the latter by the overlap of two sp3 orbitals on adjacent carbon atoms the bond lengths amount to 109  1010 m for a ch bond and 154  1010 m for a cc bond the spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp3 orbitalsthey are tetrahedrally arranged with an angle of 10947 between them structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another while both common and useful do not accurately depict the geometry conformation the spatial arrangement of the cc and ch bonds are described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformation in ethane the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes there is nearly free rotation about a carboncarbon single bond two limiting conformations are important eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation the staggered conformation is 126 kjmol 30 kcalmol lower in energy more stable than the eclipsed conformation the least stable in highly branched alkanes the bond angle may differ from the optimal value 1095 to accommodate bulky groups such distortions introduce a tension in the molecule known as steric hindrance or strain strain substantially increases reactivity spectroscopic properties spectroscopic signatures for alkanes are obtainable by the major characterization techniques infrared spectroscopy the ch stretching mode gives a strong absorptions between 2850 and 2960 cm1 and weaker bands for the cc stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300 cm1 the carbonhydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group methyl groups show bands at 1450 cm1 and 1375 cm1 while methylene groups show bands at 1465 cm1 and 1450 cm1 carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725 cm1 nmr spectroscopy the proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at δh  0515 the carbon13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon δc  830 primary methyl ch3 1555 secondary methylene ch2 2060 tertiary methyne ch and quaternary the carbon13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak due to the lack of nuclear overhauser effect and the long relaxation time and can be missed in weak samples or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time mass spectrometry since alkanes have high ionization energies their electron impact mass spectra show weak currents for their molecular ions the fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret but in the case of branched chain alkanes the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals the mass spectra for straightchain alkanes is illustrated by that for dodecane the fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group m  15 is absent fragments are more intense than the molecular ion and are spaced by intervals of 14 mass units corresponding to loss of ch2 groups chemical properties alkanes are only weakly reactive with most chemical compounds they only reacts with the strongest of electrophilic reagents by virtue of their strong ch bonds 100 kcalmol and cc bonds 90 kcalmol they are also relatively unreactive toward free radicals this inertness is the source of the term paraffins with the meaning here of lacking affinity in crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years acidbase behavior the acid dissociation constant pka values of all alkanes are estimated to range from 50 to 70 depending on the extrapolation method hence they are extremely weak acids that are practically inert to bases see carbon acids they are also extremely weak bases undergoing no observable protonation in pure sulfuric acid h0  12 although superacids that are at least millions of times stronger have been known to protonate them to give hypercoordinate alkanium ions see methanium ion thus a mixture of antimony pentafluoride sbf5 and fluorosulfonic acid hso3f called magic acid can protonate alkanes reactions with oxygen combustion reaction all alkanes react with oxygen in a combustion reaction although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases the general equation for complete combustion is in the absence of sufficient oxygen carbon monoxide or even soot can be formed as shown below for example methane see the alkane heat of formation table for detailed data the standard enthalpy change of combustion δch for alkanes increases by about 650 kjmol per ch2 group branchedchain alkanes have lower values of δch than straightchain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable biodegradation some organisms are capable of metalbolizing alkanes the methane monooxygenases convert methane to methanol for higher alkanes cytochrome p450 convert alkanes to alcohols which are then susceptible to degradation free radical reactions free radicals molecules with unpaired electrons play a large role in most reactions of alkanes free radical halogenation reactions occur with halogens leading to the production of haloalkanes the hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms the reaction of alkanes and fluorine is highly exothermic and can lead to an explosion these reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons there are three steps experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction the mixture produced however is not statistical secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary freeradicals an example can be seen in the monobromination of propane in the reed reaction sulfur dioxide and chlorineconvert hydrocarbons to sulfonyl chlorides under the influence of light under some conditions alkanes will undergo nitration ch activation certain transition metal complexes promote nonradical reactions with alkanes resulting in so ch bond activation reactions cracking cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones this reaction requires heat and catalysts the thermal cracking process follows a homolytic mechanism with formation of free radicals the catalytic cracking process involves the presence of acid catalysts usually solid acids such as silicaalumina and zeolites which promote a heterolytic asymmetric breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges usually a carbocation carbonlocalized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement cc scission in position beta ie cracking and intra and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride transfer in both types of processes the corresponding reactive intermediates radicals ions are permanently regenerated and thus they proceed by a selfpropagating chain mechanism the chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombinationjanuary 2021 isomerization and reformation dragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes isomerization and reformation are processes in which straightchain alkanes are heated in the presence of a platinum catalyst in isomerization the alkanes become branchedchain isomers in other words it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens keeping the same molecular weight in reformation the alkanes become cycloalkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons giving off hydrogen as a byproduct both of these processes raise the octane number of the substance butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers other reactions in steam reforming alkanes react with steam in the presence of a nickel catalyst to give hydrogen and carbon monoxide occurrence occurrence of alkanes in the universe alkanes form a small portion of the atmospheres of the outer gas planets such as jupiter 01 methane 2 ppm ethane saturn 02 methane 5 ppm ethane uranus 199 methane 25 ppm ethane and neptune 15 methane 15 ppm ethane titan 16 methane a satellite of saturn was examined by the huygens probe which indicated that titans atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moons surface also on titan the cassini mission has imaged seasonal methaneethane lakes near the polar regions of titan methane and ethane have also been detected in the tail of the comet hyakutake chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space away from the sun which would have evaporated these volatile molecules alkanes have also been detected in meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites occurrence of alkanes on earth traces of methane gas about 00002 or 1745 ppb occur in the earths atmosphere produced primarily by methanogenic microorganisms such as archaea in the gut of ruminants the most important commercial sources for alkanes are natural gas and oil natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane with some propane and butane oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons these hydrocarbons were formed when marine animals and plants zooplankton and phytoplankton died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an anoxic environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction these hydrocarbon deposits collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks comprise commercial oil fields they have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced the depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the energy crisis alkanes have a low solubility in water so the content in the oceans is negligible however at high pressures and low temperatures such as at the bottom of the oceans methane can cocrystallize with water to form a solid methane clathrate methane hydrate although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together methane extracted from methane clathrate is therefore a candidate for future fuels biological occurrence aside from petroleum and natural gas alkanes occur significantly in nature only as methane which is produced by some archaea by the process of methanogenesis these organisms are found in the gut of termites and cows the methane is produced from carbon dioxide or other organic compounds energy is released by the oxidation of hydrogen it is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way another route to alkanes is hydrogenolysis which entails cleavage of cheteroatom bonds using hydrogen in industry the main substrates are organonitrogen and organosulfur impurities ie the heteroatoms are n and s the specific processes are called hydrodenitrification and hydrodesulfurization hydrogenolysis can be applied to the conversion of virtually any functional group into hydrocarbons substrates include haloalkanes alcohols aldehydes ketones carboxylic acids etc both hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation are practiced in refineries the can be effected by using lithium aluminium hydride clemmenson reduction and other specialized routes coal coal is a more traditional precursor to alkanes a wide range of technologies have been intensively practiced for centuries simply heating coal gives alkanes leaving behind coke relevant technologies include the bergius process and coal liquifaction partial combustion of coal and related solid organic compounds generates carbon monoxide which can be hydrogenated using the fischertropsch process this technology allows the synthesize liquid hydrocarbons including alkanes this method is used to produce substitutes for petroleum distillates laboratory preparation rarely is there any interest in the synthesis of alkanes since they are usually commercially available and less valued than virtually any precursor the bestknown method is hydrogenation of alkenes many cx bonds can be converted to ch bonds using lithium aluminium hydride clemmenson reduction and other specialized routes hydrolysis of alkyl grignard reagents and alkyl lithium compounds gives alkanes applications fuels the dominant use of alkanes is as fuels propane and butane easily liquified gases are commonly known as liquified petroleum gas lpg from pentane to octane the alkanes are highly volatile liquids they are used as fuels in internal combustion engines as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets which would impair the uniformity of the combustion branchedchain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition which causes knocking than their straightchain homologues this propensity to premature ignition is measured by the octane rating of the fuel where 224trimethylpentane isooctane has an arbitrary value of 100 and heptane has a value of zero apart from their use as fuels the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances alkanes from nonane to for instance hexadecane an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms are liquids of higher viscosity less and less suitable for use in gasoline they form instead the major part of diesel and aviation fuel diesel fuels are characterized by their cetane number cetane being an old name for hexadecane however the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly precursors to chemicals by the process of cracking alkanes can be converted to alkenes simple alkenes are precursors to polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene when the cracking is taken to extremes alkanes can be converted to carbon black which is a significant tire component chlorination of methane gives chloromethanes which are used as solvents and building blocks for complex compounds similarly treatment of methane with sulfur gives carbon disulfide still other chemicals are prepared by reaction with sulfur trioxide and nitric oxide other some light hydrocarbons are used as aerosol sprays alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of fuel oil and lubricating oil in the latter function they work at the same time as anticorrosive agents as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface many solid alkanes find use as paraffin wax for example in candles this should not be confused however with true wax which consists primarily of esters alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in bitumen used for example in road surfacing however the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by cracking hazards alkanes are highly flammable but they have low toxicities methane is toxicologically virtually inert alkanes can be asphyxiants and narcotic see also references further reading appellate procedure in the united states categories united states appellate procedure legal procedure united states procedural law united states appellate procedure involves the rules and regulations for filing appeals in state courts and federal courts the nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case and the rules of the court in the jurisdiction where the case was prosecuted there are many types of standard of review for appeals such as de novo and abuse of discretion however most appeals begin when a party files a petition for review to a higher court for the purpose of overturning the lower courts decision an appellate court is a court that hears cases on appeal from another court depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance a party to a court case who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds these grounds typically could include errors of law fact procedure or due process in different jurisdictions appellate courts are also called appeals courts courts of appeals superior courts or supreme courts the specific procedures for appealing including even whether there is a right of appeal from a particular type of decision can vary greatly from state to state the right to file an appeal can also vary from state to state for example the new jersey constitution vests judicial power in a supreme court a superior court and other courts of limited jurisdiction with an appellate court being part of the superior court access to appellant status a party who files an appeal is called an appellant plaintiff in error petitioner or pursuer and a party on the other side is called an appellee defendant in error respondent a crossappeal is an appeal brought by the respondent for example suppose at trial the judge found for the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay 50000 if the defendant files an appeal arguing that he should not have to pay any money then the plaintiff might file a crossappeal arguing that the defendant should have to pay 200000 instead of 50000 the appellant is the party who having lost part or all their claim in a lower court decision is appealing to a higher court to have their case reconsidered this is usually done on the basis that the lower court judge erred in the application of law but it may also be possible to appeal on the basis of court misconduct or that a finding of fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the evidence the appellant in the new case can be either the plaintiff or claimant defendant thirdparty intervenor or respondent appellee from the lower case depending on who was the losing party the winning party from the lower court however is now the respondent in unusual cases the appellant can be the victor in the court below but still appeal an appellee is the party to an appeal in which the lower court judgment was in its favor the appellee is required to respond to the petition oral arguments and legal briefs of the appellant in general the appellee takes the procedural posture that the lower courts decision should be affirmed ability to appeal an appeal as of right is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle the appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal an appeal by leave or permission requires the appellant to obtain leave to appeal in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the court may have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellants demand to appeal the lower courts decision in the supreme court review in most cases is available only if the court exercises its discretion and grants a writ of certiorari in tort equity or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal in criminal matters however the state or prosecution generally has no appeal as of right and due to the double jeopardy principle the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict of acquittal but in some jurisdictions the state or prosecution may appeal as of right from a trial courts dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial courts granting of a defendants suppression motion likewise in some jurisdictions the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law by leave from the trial court or the appellate court the ability of the prosecution to appeal a decision in favor of a defendant varies significantly internationally all parties must present grounds to appeal or it will not be heard by convention in some law reports the appellant is named first this can mean that where it is the defendant who appeals the name of the case in the law reports reverses in some cases twice as the appeals work their way up the court hierarchy this is not always true however in the federal courts the parties names always stay in the same order as the lower court when an appeal is taken to the circuit courts of appeals and are reordered only if the appeal reaches the supreme courtmay 2017 direct or collateral appealing criminal convictions many jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals particularly in the criminal context the first is the traditional direct appeal in which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review the second is the collateral appeal or postconviction petition in which the petitionerappellant files the appeal in a court of first instanceusually the court that tried the case the key distinguishing factor between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in state courts and the latter in federal courtsnonfederal collateral review relief in postconviction is rare and is most often found in capital or violent felony cases the typical scenario involves an incarcerated defendant locating dna evidence demonstrating the defendants actual innocence appellate review appellate review is the general term for the process by which courts with appellate jurisdiction take jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts it is distinguished from judicial review which refers to the courts overriding constitutional or statutory right to determine if a legislative act or administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons which may vary by jurisdiction in most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final judgment generally an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal of all other orders or rulings made by the trial court in the course of the case this is because such orders cannot be appealed as of right however certain critical interlocutory court orders such as the denial of a request for an interim injunction or an order holding a person in contempt of court can be appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of there are two distinct forms of appellate review direct and collateral for example a criminal defendant may be convicted in state court and lose on direct appeal to higher state appellate courts and if unsuccessful mount a collateral action such as filing for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts generally speaking direct appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of a judgment and allege errors of law or fact  review on the other hand provides an independent and civil inquiry into the validity of a conviction and sentence and as such are generally limited to challenges to constitutional jurisdictional or other fundamental violations that occurred at trial graham v borgen 483 f 3d 475 7th cir 2007 no 044103 slip op at 7 citation omitted in angloamerican common law courts appellate review of lower court decisions may also be obtained by filing a petition for review by prerogative writ in certain cases there is no corresponding right to a writ in any pure or continental civil law legal systems though some mixed systems such as quebec recognize these prerogative writs direct appeal after exhausting the first appeal as of right defendants usually petition the highest state court to review the decision this appeal is known as a direct appeal the highest state court generally known as the supreme court exercises discretion over whether it will review the case on direct appeal a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an error that occurred at trial or some other stage in the adjudicative process preservation issues an appellants claims must usually be preserved at trial this means that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial because constitutional claims are of great magnitude appellate courts might be more lenient to review the claim even if it was not preserved for example connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims 1the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error 2 the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right 3 the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial 4 if subject to harmless error analysis the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt state postconviction relief collateral appeal all states have a postconviction relief process similar to federal postconviction relief an appellant can petition the court to correct alleged fundamental errors that were not corrected on direct review typical claims might include ineffective assistance of counsel and actual innocence based on new evidence these proceedings are normally separate from the direct appeal however some states allow for collateral relief to be sought on direct appeal after direct appeal the conviction is considered final an appeal from the post conviction court proceeds just as a direct appeal that is it goes to the intermediate appellate court followed by the highest court if the petition is granted the appellant could be released from incarceration the sentence could be modified or a new trial could be ordered habeas corpus notice of appeal a notice of appeal is a form or document that in many cases is required to begin an appeal the form is completed by the appellant or by the appellants legal representative the nature of this form can vary greatly from country to country and from court to court within a country the specific rules of the legal system will dictate exactly how the appeal is officially begun for example the appellant might have to file the notice of appeal with the appellate court or with the court from which the appeal is taken or both some courts have samples of a notice of appeal on the courts own web site in new jersey for example the administrative office of the court has promulgated a form of notice of appeal for use by appellants though using this exact form is not mandatory and the failure to use it is not a jurisdictional defect provided that all pertinent information is set forth in whatever form of notice of appeal is used the deadline for beginning an appeal can often be very short traditionally it is measured in days not months this can vary from country to country as well as within a country depending on the specific rules in force in the us federal court system criminal defendants must file a notice of appeal within 10 days of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed or the right to appeal is forfeited appellate procedure generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not the appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower courts findings of fact such as whether a defendant committed a particular act unless clearly erroneous and so will focus on the courts application of the law to those facts such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue if the appellate court finds no defect it affirms the judgment if the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision below ie in the lower court it may modify the ruling to correct the defect or it may nullify reverse or vacate the whole decision or any part of it it may in addition send the case back remand or remit to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect in some cases an appellate court may review a lower court decision de novo or completely challenging even the lower courts findings of fact this might be the proper standard of review for example if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pretrial motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony another situation is where appeal is by way of rehearing certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court sometimes the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below this would happen for example if the appellant waited too long under the appellate courts rules to file the appeal generally there is no trial in an appellate court only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pretrial and trial court proceedings are reviewedunless the appeal is by way of rehearing new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in very rare instances for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as prosecutorial misconduct in some systems an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal in other systems the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court in those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court the appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee or respondent can present arguments against it arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers if represented or pro se if the party has not engaged legal representation those arguments are presented in written briefs and sometimes in oral argument to the court at a hearing at such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs in an adversarial system appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it therefore if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner or against legal precedent that judgment will stand if not appealed  even if it might have been overturned on appeal the united states legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals a trial de novo or an appeal on the record a trial de novo is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial trial if unchallenged these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all if a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal one generally has the power to request a trial de novo by a court of record in such a proceeding all issues and evidence may be developed newly as though never heard before and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding sometimes however the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence thus helping to curb frivolous appeals in some cases an application for trial de novo effectively erases the prior trial as if it had never taken place the supreme court of virginia has stated that this court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial the only exception to this is that if a defendant appeals a conviction for a crime having multiple levels of offenses where they are convicted on a lesser offense the appeal is of the lesser offense the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses a trial on the same charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles    subject only to the limitation that conviction in the district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense permitting trial de novo in the circuit court only for the lesserincluded offense in an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result precedent and case law figure prominently in the arguments in order for the appeal to succeed the appellant must prove that the lower court committed reversible error that is an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case permitting seriously improper argument by an attorney admitting or excluding evidence improperly acting outside the courts jurisdiction injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so juror misconduct etc the failure to formally object at the time to what one views as improper action in the lower court may result in the affirmance of the lower courts judgment on the grounds that one did not preserve the issue for appeal by objecting in cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact an appellate court will apply an abuse of discretion standard of review under this standard the appellate court gives deference to the lower courts view of the evidence and reverses its decision only if it were a clear abuse of discretion this is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness on the other hand the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower courts decision on issues of law and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard in some cases an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was unconstitutional or otherwise invalid or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered in the case of new evidence there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel if a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation he is entitled to a new trial a lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words may it please the court after an appeal is heard the mandate is a formal notice of a decision by a court of appeal this notice is transmitted to the trial court and when filed by the clerk of the trial court constitutes the final judgment on the case unless the appeal court has directed further proceedings in the trial court the mandate is distinguished from the appeal courts opinion which sets out the legal reasoning for its decision in some jurisdictions the mandate is known as the remittitur results the result of an appeal can be there can be multiple outcomes so that the reviewing court can affirm some rulings reverse others and remand the case all at the same time remand is not required where there is nothing left to do in the case generally speaking an appellate courts judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed setting out with specificity the courts determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed reversed remanded or modified some reviewing courts who have discretionary review may send a case back without comment other than review improvidently granted in other words after looking at the case they chose not to say anything the result for the case of review improvidently granted is effectively the same as affirmed but without that extra higher court stamp of approval see also references external links answer law categories common law legal documents in law an answer was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something and thus generally any counterstatement or defense a reply to a question or response or objection or a correct solution of a problem in the common law an answer is the first pleading by a defendant usually filed and served upon the plaintiff within a certain strict time limit after a civil complaint or criminal information or indictment has been served upon the defendant it may have been preceded by an optional preanswer motion to dismiss or demurrer if such a motion is unsuccessful the defendant must file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse default judgment in a criminal case there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the defendant comes to court the pleading in the criminal case which is entered on the record in open court is usually either guilty or not guilty generally speaking in private civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence there is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of equitable remedy such as restitution or a permanent injunction criminal cases may lead to fines or other punishment such as imprisonment the famous

by type appellate courts jurisdiction an appellate court commonly called a court of appeals appeal court court of second instance or second instance court is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal in much of the world court systems are divided into at least three levels the trial court which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case at least one intermediate appellate court and a supreme court or court of last resort which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts often on a discretionary basis a particular court systems supreme court is its highest appellate court appellate courts nationwide can operate under varying rules under its standard of review an appellate court decides the extent of the deference it would give to the lower courts decision based on whether the appeal were one of fact or of law in reviewing an issue of fact an appellate court ordinarily gives deference to the trial courts findings it is the duty of trial judges or juries to find facts view the evidence firsthand and observe witness testimony when reviewing lower decisions on an issue of fact courts of appeal generally look for clear error the appellate court reviews issues of law de novo anew no deference and may reverse or modify the lower courts decision if the appellate court believes the lower court misapplied the facts or the law an appellate court may also review the lower judges discretionary decisions such as whether the judge properly granted a new trial or disallowed evidence the lower courts decision is only changed in cases of an abuse of discretion this standard tends to be even more deferential than the clear error standard before hearing any case the court must have jurisdiction to consider the appeal the authority of appellate courts to review the decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another in some areas the appellate court has limited powers of review generally an appellate courts judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed setting out with specificity the courts determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed reversed remanded or modified depending on the type of case and the decision below appellate review primarily consists of an entirely new hearing a non trial de novo a hearing where the appellate court gives deference to factual findings of the lower court or review of particular legal rulings made by the lower court an appeal on the record bifurcation of civil and criminal appeals while many appellate courts have jurisdiction over all cases decided by lower courts some systems have appellate courts divided by the type of jurisdiction they exercise some jurisdictions have specialized appellate courts such as the texas court of criminal appeals which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases and the us court of appeals for the federal circuit which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent cases on one hand and appeals from the court of federal claims on the other in the united states alabama tennessee and oklahoma also have separate courts of criminal appeals texas and oklahoma have the final determination of criminal cases vested in their respective courts of criminal appeals while alabama and tennessee allow decisions of its court of criminal appeals to be finally appealed to the state supreme court courts of criminal appeals courts of civil appeals appellate courts by country australia the high court has appellate jurisdiction over all other courts leave must be granted by the court before the appeal matter is heard the high court is paramount to all

from all three appellate courts are to the supreme court sri lanka the court of appeal of sri lanka located in colombo is the second senior court in the sri lankan legal system united kingdom united states in the united states both state and federal appellate courts are usually restricted to examining whether the lower court made the correct legal determinations rather than hearing direct evidence and determining what the facts of the case were furthermore us appellate courts are usually restricted to hearing appeals based on matters that were originally brought up before the trial court hence such an appellate court will not consider an appellants argument if it is based on a theory that is raised for the first time in the appeal in most us states and in us federal courts parties before the court are allowed one appeal as of right this means that a party who is unsatisfied with the outcome of a trial may bring an appeal to contest that outcome however appeals may be costly and the appellate court must find an error on the part of the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict therefore only a small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals some courts particularly supreme courts have the power of discretionary review meaning that they can decide whether they will hear an appeal brought in a particular case nomenclature many us jurisdictions title their appellate court a court of appeal or court of appeals both terms are used in the united states but the plural form is more common in american english while in contrast british english uses only the singular form the correct form is whichever is the statutorily prescribed or customary form for a particular court and particular jurisdiction in other words one should never write court of appeal when the court at issue clearly prefers to be called a court of appeals and vice versa historically certain jurisdictions have titled their appellate court a court of errors or court of errors and appeals on the premise that it was intended to correct errors made by lower courts examples of such courts include the new jersey court of errors and appeals which existed from 1844 to 1947 the connecticut supreme court of errors which has been renamed the connecticut supreme court the kentucky court of errors renamed the kentucky supreme court and the mississippi high court of errors and appeals since renamed the supreme court of mississippi in some jurisdictions a court able to hear appeals is known as an appellate division the phrase court of appeals most often refers to intermediate appellate courts however the new york court of appeals is the highest appellate court in new york the new york supreme court is a trial court of general jurisdiction the supreme court of maryland was known as the court of appeals and the appellate court of maryland was known as the court of special appeals until a 2022 constitutional amendment changed their names depending on the

entitled pikes peak it was first published in the fourth of july 1895 edition of the church periodical the congregationalist at that time the poem was entitled america ward had initially composed the songs melody in 1882 to accompany lyrics to materna basis of the hymn o mother dear jerusalem though the hymn was not first published until 1892 the combination of wards melody and batess poem was first entitled america the beautiful in 1910 the song is one of the most popular of the many american patriotic songs history in 1893 at the age of 33 bates an english professor at wellesley college had taken a train trip to colorado springs colorado to teach at colorado college several of the sights on her trip inspired her and they found their way into her poem including the worlds columbian exposition in chicago the white city with its promise of the future contained within its gleaming white buildings the wheat fields of north americas heartland kansas through which her train was riding on july 16 and the majestic view of the great plains from high atop pikes peak on the pinnacle of that mountain the words of the poem started to come to her and she wrote them down upon returning to

version was published in 1904 the first known melody written for the song was sent in by silas pratt when the poem was published in the congregationalist by 1900 at least 75 different melodies had

today just as bates had been inspired to write her poem ward too was inspired the tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from coney island back to his home in new york city after a leisurely summer day and he immediately wrote it down he composed the tune for the old hymn o mother dear jerusalem retitling the work materna wards music combined with batess poem were first published together in 1910 and titled america the beautiful ward died in 1903 not knowing the national stature his music would attain bates was more fortunate since the songs popularity was well established by the time of her death in 1929 it is included in songbooks in many religious congregations in the united states at various times in the more than one hundred years that have elapsed since the song was written particularly during the john f kennedy administration there have been efforts to give america the beautiful legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to or in place of the starspangled banner but so far this has not succeeded proponents prefer america the beautiful for various reasons saying it is easier to sing more melodic and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as the starspangled banner some prefer america the beautiful over the starspangled banner due to the latters waroriented imagery while others object to the implicit support of slavery and racism in its third verse others prefer the starspangled banner because of its war themes while that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem america the beautiful continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of americans and was even being considered before 1931 as a

walking ability of people with neurological injury these machines are therapistassisted devices that are used in the clinical setting but is limited by the personnel and labor requirements placed on physical therapists the bwstt device and many others like it assist physical therapists by providing taskspecific practice of walking in people following neurological injury prosthesis prosthesisa prosthesis prosthetic or prosthetic limb is a device that replaces a missing body part it is part of the field of biomechatronics the science of using mechanical devices with human muscular musculoskeletal and nervous systems to assist or enhance motor control lost by trauma disease or defect prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury traumatic or missing from birth congenital or to supplement defective body parts inside the body artificial heart valves are in common use with artificial hearts and lungs seeing less common use but under active technology development other medical devices and aids that can be considered prosthetics include hearing aids artificial eyes palatal obturator gastric bands and dentures prostheses are specifically not orthoses although given certain circumstances a prosthesis might end up performing some or all of the same functionary benefits as an orthosis prostheses are technically the complete finished item for instance a cleg knee alone is not a prosthesis but only a prosthetic component the complete prosthesis would consist of the attachment system to the residual limb  usually a socket and all the attachment hardware components all the way down to and including the terminal device despite the technical difference the terms are often used interchangeably the terms prosthetic and orthotic are adjectives used to describe devices such as a prosthetic knee the terms prosthetics and orthotics are used to describe the respective allied health fields an occupational therapists role in prosthetics include therapy training and evaluations prosthetic training includes orientation to prosthetics components and terminology donning and doffing wearing schedule and how to care for residual limb and the prosthesis exoskeletons a powered exoskeleton is a wearable mobile machine that is powered by a system of electric motors pneumatics levers hydraulics or a combination of technologies that allow for limb movement with increased strength and endurance its design aims to provide back support sense the users motion and send a signal to motors which manage the gears the exoskeleton supports the shoulder waist and thigh and assists movement for lifting and holding heavy items while lowering back stress adaptive seating and positioning people with balance and motor function challenges often need specialized equipment to sit or stand safely and securely this equipment is frequently specialized for specific settings such as in a classroom or nursing home positioning is often important in seating arrangements to ensure that users body pressure is distributed equally without inhibiting movement in a desired way positioning devices have been developed to aid in allowing people to stand and bear weight on their legs without risk of a fall these standers are generally grouped into two categories based on the position of the occupantfebruary 2022 prone standers distribute the body weight to the front of the individual and usually have a tray in front of them this makes them good for users who are actively trying to carry out some task supine standers distribute the body weight to the back and are good for cases where the user has more limited mobility or is recovering from injury for children children with severe disabilities can develop learned helplessness which makes them lose interest in their environment robotic arms are used to provide an alternative method to engage in joint play activities these robotic arms allow children to manipulate real objects in the context of play activities children with disabilities have challenges in accessing play and social interactions play is essential for the physical emotional and social wellbeing of all children the use of assistive technology has been recommended to facilitate the communication mobility and independence of children with disabilities augmentative alternative communication aac devices have been shown to facilitate the growth and development of language as well as increase rates of symbolic play in children with cognitive disabilities aac devices can be notech sign language and body language lowtech picture boards paper and pencils or hightech tablets and speech generating devices the choice of aac device is very important and should be determined on a casebycase basis by speech therapists and assistive technology professionals the early introduction of powered mobility has been shown to positively impact the play and psychosocial skills of children who are unable to move independently powered cars such as the go baby go program have emerged as a costeffective means of facilitating the inclusion of children with mobility impairments in school visual impairments many people with serious visual impairments live independently using a wide range of tools and techniques examples of assistive technology for visually impairment include screen readers screen magnifiers braille embossers desktop video magnifiers and voice recorders screen readers screen readers are used to help the visually impaired to easily access electronic information these software programs run on a computer to convey the displayed information through voice texttospeech or braille refreshable braille displays in combination with magnification for low vision users in some cases there are a variety of platforms and applications available for a variety of costs with differing feature sets some example of screen readers are apple voiceover google talkback and microsoft narrator this software is provided free of charge on all apple devices apple voiceover includes the option to magnify the screen control the keyboard and provide verbal descriptions to describe what is happening on the screen there are thirty languages to select from it also has the capacity to read aloud file content as well as web pages email messages and word processing files as mentioned above screen readers may rely on the assistance of texttospeech tools to use the texttospeech tools the documents must in an electronic form that is uploaded as the digital format however people usually will use the hard copy documents scanned into the computer which cannot be recognized by the texttospeech software to solve this issue people always use optical character recognition technology accompanied with texttospeech software braille and braille technology braille is a system of raised dots formed into units called braille cells a full braille cell is made up of six dots with two parallel rows of three dots but other combinations and quantities of dots represent other letters numbers punctuation marks or words people can then use their fingers to read the code of raised dots assistive technology using braille is called braille technology braille translator a braille translator is a computer program that can translate inkprint into braille or braille into inkprint a braille translator can be an app on a computer or be built into a website a smartphone or a braille device braille embosser a braille embosser is simply put a printer for braille instead of a standard printer adding ink onto a page the braille embosser imprints the raised dots of braille onto a page some braille embossers combine both braille and ink so the documents can be read with either sight or touch refreshable braille display a refreshable braille display or braille terminal is an electromechanical device for displaying braille characters usually by means of roundtipped pins raised through holes in a flat surface computer users who cannot use a computer monitor use it to read a braille output version of the displayed text desktop video magnifier desktop video magnifiers are electronic devices that use a camera and a display screen to perform digital magnification of printed materials they enlarge printed pages for those with low vision a camera connects to a monitor that displays realtime images and the user can control settings such as magnification focus contrast underlining highlighting and other screen preferences they come in a variety of sizes and styles some are small and portable with handheld cameras while others are much larger and mounted on a fixed stand screen magnification software a screen magnifier is software that interfaces with a computers graphical output to present enlarged screen content it allows users to enlarge the texts and graphics on their computer screens for easier viewing similar to desktop video magnifiers this technology assists people with low vision after the user loads the software into their computers memory it serves as a kind of computer magnifying glass wherever the computer cursor moves it enlarges the area around it this allows greater computer accessibility for a wide range of visual abilities largeprint and tactile keyboards a largeprint keyboard has large letters printed on the keys on the keyboard shown the round buttons at the top control software which can magnify the screen zoom in change the background color of the screen or make the mouse cursor on the screen larger the bump dots on the keys installed in this case by the organization using the keyboards help the user find the right keys in a tactile way navigation assistance assistive technology for navigation has exploded on the ieee xplore database since 2000august 2019 with over 7500 engineering articles written on assistive technologies and visual impairment in the past 25 years and over 1300 articles on solving the problem of navigation for people who are blind or visually impaired as well over 600 articles on augmented reality and visual impairment have appeared in the engineering literature since 2000 most of these articles were published within the past five yearsfebruary 2022 and the number of articles in this area is increasing every year gps accelerometers gyroscopes and cameras can pinpoint the exact location of the user and provide information on what is in the immediate vicinity and assistance in getting to a destination wearable technology wearable technology are smart electronic devices that can be worn on the body as an implant or an accessory new technologies are exploring how the visually impaired can receive visual information through wearable devices some wearable devices for visual impairment include orcam device esight and brainport personal emergency response systems personal emergency response systems pers or telecare uk term are a particular sort of assistive technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer an example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors thermometers for hypothermia risk flooding and unlit gas sensors for people with mild dementia notably these alerts can be customized to the particular persons risks when the alert is triggered a message is sent to a caregiver or contact center who can respond appropriately accessibility software in humancomputer interaction computer accessibility also known as accessible computing refers to the accessibility of a computer system to all people regardless of disability or severity of impairment examples include web accessibility guidelines another approach is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal such as a smart card that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed text size etc to their particular needs this is useful where users want to access public computer based terminals in libraries atm information kiosks etc the concept is encompassed by the cen en 13324 identification card systems  manmachine interface this development of this standard has been supported in europe by snapi and has been successfully incorporated into the lasseo specifications but with limited success due to the lack of interest from public computer terminal suppliers hearing impairments people in the ddeaf and hard of hearing community have a more difficult time receiving auditory information as compared to hearing individuals these individuals often rely on visual and tactile mediums for receiving and communicating information the use of assistive technology and devices provides this community with various solutions to auditory communication needs by providing higher sound for those who are hard of hearing tactile feedback visual cues and improved technology access individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing use a variety of assistive technologies that provide them with different access to information in numerous environments most devices either provide amplified sound or alternate ways to access information through vision andor vibration these technologies can be grouped into three general categories hearing technology alerting devices and communication support hearing aids a hearing aid or deaf aid is an electroacoustic device which is designed to amplify sound for the wearer usually with the aim of making speech more intelligible and to correct impaired hearing as measured by audiometry this type of assistive technology helps people with hearing loss participate more fully in their hearing communities by allowing them to hear more clearly they amplify any and all sound waves through use of a microphone amplifier and speaker there is a wide variety of hearing aids available including digital intheear inthecanal behindtheear and onthebody aids assistive listening devices assistive listening devices include fm infrared and loop assistive listening devices this type of technology allows people with hearing difficulties to focus on a speaker or subject by getting rid of extra background noises and distractions making places like auditoriums classrooms and meetings much easier to participate in the assistive listening device usually uses a microphone to capture an audio source near to its origin and broadcast it wirelessly over an fm frequency modulation transmission ir infra red transmission il induction loop transmission or other transmission methods the person who is listening may use an fmiril receiver to tune into the signal and listen at hisher preferred volume amplified telephone equipment this type of assistive technology allows users to amplify the volume and clarity of their phone calls so that they can easily partake in this medium of communication there are also options to adjust the frequency and tone of a call to suit their individual hearing needs additionally there is a wide variety of amplified telephones to choose from with different degrees of amplification for example a phone with 26 to 40 decibel is generally sufficient for mild hearing loss while a phone with 71 to 90 decibel is better for more severe hearing loss augmentative and alternative communication augmentative and alternative communication aac is an umbrella term that encompasses methods of communication for those with impairments or restrictions on the production or comprehension of spoken or written language aac systems are extremely diverse and depend on the capabilities of the user they may be as basic as pictures on a board that are used to request food drink or other care or they can be advanced speech generating devices based on speech synthesis that are capable of storing hundreds of phrases and words cognitive impairments assistive technology for cognition atc is the use of technology usually high tech to augment and assist cognitive processes such as attention memory selfregulation navigation emotion recognition and management planning and sequencing activity systematic reviews of the field have found that the number of atc are growing rapidly but have focused on memory and planning that there is emerging evidence for efficacy that a lot of scope exists to develop new atc examples of atc include neuropage which prompts users about meetings wakamaru which provides companionship and reminds users to take medicine and calls for help if something is wrong and telephone reassurance systems memory aids memory aids are any type of assistive technology that helps a user learn and remember certain information many memory aids are used for cognitive impairments such as reading writing or organizational difficulties for example a smartpen records handwritten notes by creating both a digital copy and an audio recording of the text users simply tap certain parts of their notes the pen saves it and reads it back to them from there the user can also download their notes onto a computer for increased accessibility digital voice recorders are also used to record in the moment information for fast and easy recall at a later time a 2017 cochrane review highlighted the current lack of highquality evidence to determine whether assistive technology effectively supports people with dementia to manage memory issues thus it is not presently sure whether or not assistive technology is beneficial for memory problems educational software educational software is software that assists people with reading learning comprehension and organizational difficulties any accommodation software such as text readers notetakers text enlargers organization tools word predictions and talking word processors falls under the category of educational software eating impairments adaptive eating devices include items commonly used by the general population like spoons and forks and plates however they become assistive technology when they are modified to accommodate the needs of people who have difficulty using standard cutlery due to a disabling condition common modifications include increasing the size of the utensil handle to make it easier to grasp plates and bowls may have a guard on the edge that stops food being pushed off of the dish when it is being scooped more sophisticated equipment for eating includes manual and powered feeding devices these devices support those who have little or no hand and arm function and enable them to eat independently in sports assistive technology in sports is an area of technology design that is growing assistive technology is the array of new devices created to enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play assistive technology may be used in adaptive sports where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate or assistive technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind an increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports leading to the development of new assistive technology assistive technology devices can be simple or lowtechnology or they may use highly advanced technology lowtech devices can include velcro gloves and adaptive bands and tubes hightech devices can include allterrain wheelchairs and adaptive bicycles accordingly assistive technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to the elite paralympic games more complex assistive technology devices have been developed over time and as a result sports for people with disabilities have changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competitionoriented activity in education in the united states there are two major pieces of legislation that govern the use of assistive technology within the school system the first is section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 and the second being the individuals with disabilities education act idea which was first enacted in 1975 under the name the education for all handicapped children act in 2004 during the reauthorization period for idea the national instructional material access center nimac was created which provided a repository of accessible text including publishers textbooks to students with a qualifying disability files provided are in xml format and used as a starting platform for braille readers screen readers and other digital text software idea defines assistive technology as follows any item piece of equipment or product system whether acquired commercially off the shelf modified or customized that is used to increase maintain or improve functional capabilities of a child with a disability b exceptionthe term does not include a medical device that is surgically implanted or the replacement of such device assistive technology listed is a students iep is not only recommended it is required koch 2017 these devices help students both with and without disabilities access the curriculum in a way they were previously unable to koch 2017 occupational therapists play an important role in educating students parents and teachers about the assistive technology they may interact with assistive technology in this area is broken down into low mid and high tech categories low tech encompasses equipment that is often low cost and does not include batteries or requires charging examples include adapted paper and pencil grips for writing or masks and color overlays for reading mid tech supports used in the school setting include the use of handheld spelling dictionaries and portable word processors used to keyboard writing high tech supports involve the use of tablet devices and computers with accompanying software software supports for writing include the use of auditory feedback while keyboarding word prediction for spelling and speech to text supports for reading include the use of text to speech tts software and font modification via access to digital text limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard equations and auditory feedback of more complex equations using mathml and daisy computer accessibility one of the largest problems that affect disabled people is discomfort with prostheses an experiment performed in massachusetts used 20 people with various sensors attached to their arms the subjects tried different arm exercises and the sensors recorded their movements all of the data helped engineers develop new engineering concepts for prosthetics assistive technology may attempt to improve the ergonomics of the devices themselves such as dvorak and other alternative keyboard layouts which offer more ergonomic layouts of the keys assistive technology devices have been created to enable disabled people to use modern touch screen mobile computers such as the ipad iphone and ipod touch the pererro is a plug and play adapter for ios devices which uses the built in apple voiceover feature in combination with a basic switch this brings touch screen technology to those who were previously unable to use it apple with the release of ios 7 had introduced the ability to navigate apps using switch control switch access could be activated either through an external bluetooth connected switch single touch of the screen or use of right and left head turns using the devices camera additional accessibility features include the use of assistive touch which allows a user to access multitouch gestures through preprogrammed onscreen buttons for users with physical disabilities a large variety of switches are available and customizable to the users needs varying in size shape or amount of pressure required for activation switch access may be placed near any area of the body which has consistent and reliable mobility and less subject to fatigue common sites include the hands head and feet eye gaze and head mouse systems can also be used as an alternative mouse navigation a user may use single or multiple switch sites and the process often involves a scanning through items on a screen and activating the switch once the desired object is highlighted home automation the form of home automation called assistive domotics focuses on making it possible for elderly and disabled people to live independently home automation is becoming a viable option for the elderly and disabled who would prefer to stay in their own homes rather than move to a healthcare facility this field uses much of the same technology and equipment as home automation for security entertainment and energy conservation but tailors it towards elderly and disabled users for example automated prompts and reminders use motion sensors and prerecorded audio messages an automated prompt in the kitchen may remind the resident to turn off the oven and one by the front door may remind the resident to lock the door assistive technology and innovation innovation is happening in assistive technology either through improvements to existing devices or the creation of new products in the wipo published 2021 report on technology trends assistive products are grouped into either conventional or emerging technologies conventional assisting technology tracks innovation within wellestablished assistive products whereas emerging assistive technology refers to more advanced products these identified advanced assistive products are distinguished from the conventional ones by the use of one or more enabling technologies for instance artificial intelligence internet of things advanced sensors new material additive manufacturing advanced robotics augmented and virtual reality or by the inclusion of implantable productscomponents such emerging assistive products are either more sophisticated or more functional versions of conventional assistive products or completely novel assistive devices for instance in conventional selfcare assistive technology technologies involved typically include adaptive clothing adaptive eating devices incontinence products assistive products for manicure pedicure hair and facial care dental care or assistive products for sexual activities in comparison emerging selfcare assistive technologies include health and emotion monitoring smart diapers smart medication dispensing and management or feeding assistant robot although the distinction between conventional and emerging technologies is not always clearcut emerging assistive technology tends to be smarter using ai and being more connected and interactive and including bodyintegrated solutions or components to a great extent this  conventional  versus  emerging  classification is based on the whos priority assistive products list and the iso 9999 standard for assistive products for persons with disabilities the apl delineating the absolute minimum that countries should be offering to their citizens and iso 9999 defining those products which are already well established in the market this wellestablished status is reflected in the patent filings between 2013 and 2017 patent registrations for assistive technologies identified as conventional are nearly eight times larger than the ones for emerging assistive technologies however patent filings related to more recent emerging assistive technologies are growing almost three times as fast as those pertaining to conventional ones patent filings in both conventional and emerging assistive technology are highly concentrated on mobility hearing and vision investment in emerging assistive technology also focuses on environment in the conventional sector mobility represent 54 of all patents fillings and is an indication of increased interest in advanced mobility assistive product categories such as advanced prosthetics walking aids wheelchairs and exoskeletons in the past the top patent offices for filing and therefore perceived target markets in assistive technology have been the us and japan patenting activity has however been declining in these two jurisdictions at the same time there has been a surge in patent filings in china and an increase in filings in the republic of korea this pattern is observed for both conventional and emerging assistive technology with chinas annual filings surpassing those of the us in 2008 for conventional and 2014 for emerging assistive technology patent filings related to conventional assistive technology have also declined in europe especially in germany france the netherlands and norway patenting activity indicates the amount of interest and the investment made in respect to an inventions applicability and its commercialization potential there is typically a lag between filing a patent application and commercialization with a product being classified in various stages of readiness levels research concept proof of concept minimum viable product and finally commercial product according to the 2021 wipo report the emerging technologies closest to a fully commercial product were for example the technology readiness level and the related patenting activity can also be explained through the following factors which contribute to a products entry to market such as the expected impact on a persons participation in different aspects of life the ease of adoption need for training fitting additional equipment for interoperability and so on the societal acceptance and potential ethical concerns and the need for regulatory approval this is mainly the case for assistive technology that qualifies as medical technology among these aspects acceptability and ethical considerations are particularly relevant to those technologies that are extremely invasive such as cortical or auditory brainstem implants or replace the human caregiver and human interaction or collect and use data on cloudbased services or interconnected devices eg companion robots smart nursing and healthmonitoring technologies raising privacy issues and requiring connectivity or raise safety concerns such as autonomous wheelchairs beyond the patent landscape industrial designs have an added importance for the field of assistive technology assistive technology is often not adopted or else abandoned entirely because of issues to do with design lack of appeal or comfort poor ergonomics design often plays a role after the patenting activity as a product needs to be redesigned for mass production impacts overall assistive technology aims to allow disabled people to participate more fully in all aspects of life home school and community and increases their opportunities for education social interactions and potential for meaningful employment it creates greater independence and control for disabled individuals for example in one study of 1342 infants toddlers and preschoolers all with some kind of developmental physical sensory or cognitive disability the use of assistive technology created improvements in child development these included improvements in cognitive social communication literacy motor adaptive and increases in engagement in learning activities additionally it has been found to lighten caregiver load both family and professional caregivers benefit from assistive technology through its use the time that a family member or friend would need to care for a patient significantly decreases however studies show that care time for a professional caregiver increases when assistive technology is used nonetheless their work load is significantly easier as the assistive technology frees them of having to perform certain tasks there are several platforms that use machine learning to identify the appropriate assistive device to suggest to patients making assistive devices more accessible history in 1988 the national institute on disability and rehabilitation research nidrr awarded gaulladet university a grant for the project robotic finger spelling hand for communication and access to text by deafblind persons researchers at the university developed and tested a robotic hand although it was never commercialized the concept is relevant for current and future research since this grant many others have been written nidrr funded research appears to be moving from the fabrication of robotic arms that can be used by disabled persons to perform daily activities to developing robotics that assist with therapy in the hopes of achieving longterm performance gains if there is success in development of robotics these massmarketed products could assist tomorrows longerliving elderly individuals enough to postpone nursing home stays jim osborn executive director of the quality of life technology center told a 2007 gathering of longterm care providers that if such advances could delay all nursing home admissions by a month societal savings could be 1 billion monthly shortage of both paid personal assistants and available family members makes artificial assistance a necessity see also references bibliography external links abacus categories abacus mathematical tools chinese mathematics egyptian mathematics greek mathematics indian mathematics japanese mathematics korean mathematics roman mathematics an abacus plural form abaci or abacuses also called a counting frame is a handoperated calculating tool which was used from ancient times in the ancient near east europe china and russia until the adoption of the hinduarabic numeral system an abacus consists of a twodimensional array of slidable beads or similar objects in their earliest designs the beads could be loose on a flat surface or sliding in grooves later the beads were made to slide on rods and built into a frame allowing faster manipulation each rod typically represents one digit of a multidigit number laid out using a positional numeral system such as base ten though some cultures used different numerical bases roman and east asian abacuses use a system resembling biquinary coded decimal with a top deck containing one or two beads representing fives and a bottom deck containing four or five beads representing ones natural numbers are normally used but some allow simple fractional components eg 1 1 and 1 in roman abacus and a decimal point can be imagined for fixedpoint arithmetic any particular abacus design supports multiple methods to perform calculations including addition subtraction multiplication division and square and cube roots the beads are first arranged to represent a number then are manipulated to perform a mathematical operation with another number and their final position can be read as the result or can be used as the starting number for subsequent operations in the ancient world abacuses were a practical calculating tool although calculators and computers are commonly used today instead of abacuses abacuses remain in everyday use in some countries the abacus has an advantage of not requiring a writing implement and paper needed for algorism or an electric power source merchants traders and clerks in some parts of eastern europe russia china and africa use abacuses the abacus remains in common use as a scoring system in nonelectronic table games others may use an abacus due to visual impairment that prevents the use of a calculator the abacus is still used to teach the fundamentals of mathematics to children in most countriesjanuary 2024 etymology the word abacus dates to at least ad 1387 when a middle english work borrowed the word from latin that described a sandboard abacus the latin word is derived from ancient greek ἄβαξ abax which means something without a base and colloquially any piece of rectangular material alternatively without reference to ancient texts on etymology it has been suggested that it means a square tablet strewn with dust or drawingboard covered with dust for the use of mathematics the exact shape of the latin perhaps reflects the genitive form of the greek word ἄβακoς abakos while the table strewn with dust definition is popular some argue evidence is insufficient for that conclusion greek ἄβαξ probably borrowed from a northwest semitic language like phoenician evidenced by a cognate with the hebrew word ʾābāq אבק or dust in the postbiblical sense sand used as a writing surface both abacuses and abaci are used as plurals the user of an abacus is called an abacist history mesopotamia the sumerian abacus appeared between 2700 and 2300 bc it held a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal base 60 number system some scholars point to a character in babylonian cuneiform that may have been derived from a representation of the abacus it is the belief of old babylonian scholars such as ettore carruccio that old babylonians seem to have used the abacus for the operations of addition and subtraction however this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations egypt greek historian herodotus mentioned the abacus in ancient egypt he wrote that the egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left opposite in direction to the greek lefttoright method archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters however wall depictions of this instrument are yet to be discovered persia at around 600 bc persians first began to use the abacus during the achaemenid empire under the parthian sassanian and iranian empires scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions with the countries around them  india china and the roman empire which is how the abacus may have been exported to other countries greece the earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the greek abacus dates to the 5th century bc demosthenes 384 bc322 bc complained that the need to use pebbles for calculations was too difficult a play by alexis from the 4th century bc mentions an abacus and pebbles for accounting and both diogenes and polybius use the abacus as a metaphor for human behavior stating that men that sometimes stood for more and sometimes for less like the pebbles on an abacus the greek abacus was a table of wood or marble preset with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculationsapril 2023 this greek abacus was used in achaemenid persia the etruscan civilization ancient rome and the western christian world until the french revolution a tablet found on the greek island salamis in 1846 ad the salamis tablet dates to 300 bc making it the oldest counting board discovered so far it is a slab of white marble 149 in length 75 wide and 45 thick on which are 5 groups of markings in the tablets center is a set of 5 parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the bottommost horizontal line and the single vertical line below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection the third sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line also from this time frame the darius vase was unearthed in 1851 it was covered with pictures including a treasurer holding a wax tablet in one hand while manipulating counters on a table with the other rome the normal method of calculation in ancient rome as in greece was by moving counters on a smooth table originally pebbles latin calculi were used marked lines indicated units fives tens etc as in the roman numeral system writing in the 1st century bc horace refers to the wax abacus a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus one example of archaeological evidence of the roman abacus shown nearby in reconstruction dates to the 1st century ad it has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each the groove marked i indicates units x tens and so on up to millions the beads in the shorter grooves denote fives five units five tens etc resembling a biquinary coded decimal system related to the roman numerals the short grooves on the right may have been used for marking roman ounces ie fractions medieval europe the roman system of counter casting was used widely in medieval europe and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century wealthy abacists used decorative minted counters called jetons due to pope sylvester iis reintroduction of the abacus with modifications it became widely used in europe again during the 11th century it used beads on wires unlike the traditional roman counting boards which meant the abacus could be used much faster and was more easily moved china the earliest known written documentation of the chinese abacus dates to the 2nd century bc the chinese abacus also known as the suanpan 算盤算盘 lit calculating tray comes in various lengths and widths depending on the operator it usually has more than seven rods there are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom one to represent numbers in a biquinary coded decimallike system the beads are usually rounded and made of hardwood the beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam beads moved toward the beam are counted while those moved away from it are not one of the top beads is 5 while one of the bottom beads is 1 each rod has a number under it showing the place value the suanpan can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center the prototype of the chinese abacus appeared during the han dynasty and the beads are oval the song dynasty and earlier used the 14 type or fourbeads abacus similar to the modern abacus including the shape of the beads commonly known as japanesestyle abacusjune 2019 in the early ming dynasty the abacus began to appear in a 15 ratio the upper deck had one bead and the bottom had five beads in the late ming dynasty the abacus styles appeared in a 25 ratio the upper deck had two beads and the bottom had five various calculation techniques were devised for suanpan enabling efficient calculations some schools teach students how to use it in the long scroll along the river during the qingming festival painted by zhang zeduan during the song dynasty 9601297 a suanpan is clearly visible beside an account book and doctors prescriptions on the counter of an apothecarys feibao the similarity of the roman abacus to the chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other given evidence of a trade relationship between the roman empire and china however no direct connection has been demonstrated and the similarity of the abacuses may be coincidental both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand where the roman model like most modern korean and japanese has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place the standard suanpan has 5 plus 2 incidentally this allows use with a hexadecimal numeral system or any base up to 18 which may have been used for traditional chinese measures of weight instead of running on wires as in the chinese korean and japanese models the roman model used grooves presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower another possible source of the suanpan is chinese counting rods which operated with a decimal system but lacked the concept of zero as a placeholder the zero was probably introduced to the chinese in the tang dynasty 618907 when travel in the indian ocean and the middle east would have provided direct contact with india allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the decimal point from indian merchants and mathematicians india the abhidharmakośabhāṣya of vasubandhu 316396 a sanskrit work on buddhist philosophy says that the secondcentury ce philosopher vasumitra said that placing a wick sanskrit vartikā on the number one ekāṅka means it is a one while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called a hundred and on the number one thousand means it is a thousand it is unclear exactly what this arrangement may have been around the 5th century indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the abacus hindu texts used the term śūnya zero to indicate the empty column on the abacus japan in japan the abacus is called soroban 算盤 そろばん lit counting tray it was imported from china in the 14th century it was probably in use by the working class a century or more before the ruling class adopted it as the class structure obstructed such changes the 14 abacus which removes the seldomused second and fifth bead became popular in the 1940s todays japanese abacus is a 14 type fourbead abacus introduced from china in the muromachi era it adopts the form of the upper deck one bead and the bottom four beads the top bead on the upper deck was equal to five and the bottom one is similar to the chinese or korean abacus and the decimal number can be expressed so the abacus is designed as a onefour device the beads are always in the shape of a diamond the quotient division is generally used instead of the division method at the same time in order to make the multiplication and division digits consistently use the division multiplication later japan had a 35 abacus called 天三算盤 which is now in the ize rongji collection of shansi village in yamagata city japan also used a 25 type abacus the fourbead abacus spread and became common around the world improvements to the japanese abacus arose in various places in china an aluminium frame plastic bead abacus was used the file is next to the four beads and pressing the clearing button put the upper bead in the upper position and the lower bead in the lower position the abacus is still manufactured in japan even with the proliferation practicality and affordability of pocket electronic calculators the use of the soroban is still taught in japanese primary schools as part of mathematics primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation using visual imagery can complete a calculation as quickly as a physical instrument korea the chinese abacus migrated from china to korea around 1400 ad koreans call it jupan 주판 supan 수판 or jusan 주산 the fourbeads abacus 14 was introduced during the goryeo dynasty the 51 abacus was introduced to korea from china during the ming dynasty native america some sources mention the use of an abacus called a nepohualtzintzin in ancient aztec culture this mesoamerican abacus used a 5digit base20 system the word nepōhualtzintzin nepoːwaɬˈtsintsin comes from nahuatl formed by the roots ne  personal  pōhual or pōhualli ˈpoːwalːi  the account  and tzintzin ˈtsintsin  small similar elements its complete meaning was taken as counting with small similar elements its use was taught in the calmecac to the temalpouhqueh temaɬˈpoʍkeʔ who were students dedicated to taking the accounts of skies from childhood the nepōhualtzintzin was divided into two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord in the left part were four beads beads in the first row have unitary values 1 2 3 and 4 and on the right side three beads had values of 5 10 and 15 respectively in order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows it is enough to multiply by 20 by each row the value of the corresponding count in the first row the device featured 13 rows with 7 beads 91 in total this was a basic number for this culture it had a close relation to natural phenomena the underworld and the cycles of the heavens one nepōhualtzintzin 91 represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts two nepōhualtzitzin 182 is the number of days of the corns cycle from its sowing to its harvest three nepōhualtzintzin 273 is the number of days of a babys gestation and four nepōhualtzintzin 364 completed a cycle and approximated one year when translated into modern computer arithmetic the nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to 18 in floating point which precisely calculated large and small amounts although round off was not allowed the rediscovery of the nepōhualtzintzin was due to the mexican engineer david esparza hidalgo who in his travels throughout mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them in gold jade encrustations of shell etc very old nepōhualtzintzin are attributed to the olmec culture and some bracelets of mayan origin as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures sanchez wrote in arithmetic in maya that another base 5 base 4 abacus had been found in the yucatán peninsula that also computed calendar data this was a finger abacus on one hand 0 1 2 3 and 4 were used and on the other hand 0 1 2 and 3 were used note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles the quipu of the incas was a system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical data like advanced tally sticks  but not used to perform calculations calculations were carried out using a yupana quechua for counting tool see figure which was still in use after the conquest of peru the working principle of a yupana is unknown but in 2001 italian mathematician de pasquale proposed an explanation by comparing the form of several yupanas researchers found that calculations were based using the fibonacci sequence 1 1 2 3 5 and powers of 10 20 and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument using the fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at a minimum russia the russian abacus the schoty счёты plural from счёт counting usually has a single slanted deck with ten beads on each wire except one wire with four beads for quarterruble fractions 4bead wire was introduced for quarterkopeks which were minted until 1916 the russian abacus is used vertically with each wire running horizontally the wires are usually bowed upward in the center to keep the beads pinned to either side it is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right during manipulation beads are moved to the left for easy viewing the middle 2 beads on each wire the 5th and 6th bead usually are of a different color from the other eight likewise the left bead of the thousands wire and the million wire if present may have a different color the russian abacus was in use in shops and markets throughout the former soviet union and its usage was taught in most schools until the 1990s even the 1874 invention of mechanical calculator odhner arithmometer had not replaced them in russia according to yakov perelman some businessmen attempting to import calculators into the russian empire were known to leave in despair after watching a skilled abacus operator likewise the mass production of felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce abacus use in the soviet union the russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of domestic microcalculators in 1974 the russian abacus was brought to france around 1820 by mathematician jeanvictor poncelet who had served in napoleons army and had been a prisoner of war in russia the abacus had fallen out of use in western europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and algorismic methodsapril 2023 to poncelets french contemporaries it was something new poncelet used it not for any applied purpose but as a teaching and demonstration aid the turks and the armenian people used abacuses similar to the russian schoty it was named a coulba by the turks and a choreb by the armenians school abacus around the world abacuses have been used in preschools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the numeral system and arithmetic in western countries a bead frame similar to the russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame is common see image the wireframe may be used either with positional notation like other abacuses thus the 10wire version may represent numbers up to 9999999999 or each bead may represent one unit eg 74 can be represented by shifting all beads on 7 wires and 4 beads on the 8th wire so numbers up to 100 may be represented in the bead frame shown the gap between the 5th and 6th wire corresponding to the color change between the 5th and the 6th bead on each wire suggests the latter use teaching multiplication eg 6 times 7 may be represented by shifting 7 beads on 6 wires the redandwhite abacus is used in contemporary primary schools for a wide range of numberrelated lessons the twenty bead version referred to by its dutch name rekenrek calculating frame is often used either on a string of beads or on a rigid framework feynman vs the abacus physicist richard feynman was noted for facility in mathematical calculations he wrote about an encounter in brazil with a japanese abacus expert who challenged him to speed contests between feynmans pen and paper and the abacus the abacus was much faster for addition somewhat faster for multiplication but feynman was faster at division when the abacus was used for a really difficult challenge ie cube roots feynman won easily however the number chosen at random was close to a number feynman happened to know was an exact cube allowing him to use approximate methods neurological analysis learning how to calculate with the abacus may improve capacity for mental calculation abacusbased mental calculation amc which was derived from the abacus is the act of performing calculations including addition subtraction multiplication and division in the mind by manipulating an imagined abacus it is a highlevel cognitive skill that runs calculations with an effective algorithm people doing longterm amc training show higher numerical memory capacity and experience more effectively connected neural pathways they are able to retrieve memory to deal with complex processes amc involves both visuospatial and visuomotor processing that generate the visual abacus and move the imaginary beads since it only requires that the final position of beads be remembered it takes less memory and less computation timeclear renaissance abacuses binary abacus the binary abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate numbers the abacus shows how numbers letters and signs can be stored in a binary system on a computer or via ascii the device consists of a series of beads on parallel wires arranged in three separate rows the beads represent a switch on the computer in either an on or off position visually impaired users an adapted abacus invented by tim cranmer and called a cranmer abacus is commonly used by visually impaired users a piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads keeping them in place while the users manipulate them the device is then used to perform the mathematical functions of multiplication division addition subtraction square root and cube root although blind students have benefited from talking calculators the abacus is often taught to these students in early grades blind students can also complete mathematical assignments using a braillewriter and nemeth code a type of braille code for mathematics but large multiplication and long division problems are tedious the abacus gives these students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper many blind people find this number machine a useful tool throughout life see also notes footnotes references reading external links tutorials history curiosities acid categories acids acidbase chemistry an acid is a molecule or ion capable of either donating a proton ie hydrogen ion h known as a brønstedlowry acid or forming a covalent bond with an electron pair known as a lewis acid the first category of acids are the proton donors or brønstedlowry acids in the special case of aqueous solutions proton donors form the hydronium ion h3o and are known as arrhenius acids brønsted and lowry generalized the arrhenius theory to include nonaqueous solvents a brønsted or arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of h aqueous arrhenius acids have characteristic properties that provide a practical description of an acid acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste can turn blue litmus red and react with bases and certain metals like calcium to form salts the word acid is derived from the latin acidus meaning sour an aqueous solution of an acid has a ph less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as acid as in dissolved in acid while the strict definition refers only to the solute a lower ph means a higher acidity and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid a solution of hydrogen chloride that is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes acetic acid vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid sulfuric acid used in car batteries and citric acid found in citrus fruits as these examples show acids in the colloquial sense can be solutions or pure substances and can be derived from acids in the strict sense that are solids liquids or gases strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid the second category of acids are lewis acids which form a covalent bond with an electron pair an example is boron trifluoride bf3 whose boron atom has a vacant orbital that can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia nh3 lewis considered this as a generalization of the brønsted definition so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons h into the solution which then accept electron pairs hydrogen chloride acetic acid and most other brønstedlowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair however and are therefore not lewis acids conversely many lewis acids are not arrhenius or brønstedlowry acids in modern terminology an acid is implicitly a brønsted acid and not a lewis acid since chemists almost always refer to a lewis acid explicitly as a lewis acid definitions and concepts modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions or can be dissolved in water so the arrhenius and brønstedlowry definitions are the most relevant the brønstedlowry definition is the most widely used definition unless otherwise specified acidbase reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton h from an acid to a base hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions although alcohols and amines can be brønstedlowry acids they can also function as lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms arrhenius acids in 1884 svante arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions h later described as protons or hydrons an arrhenius acid is a substance that when added to water increases the concentration of h ions in the water chemists often write haq and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acidbase reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus a proton does not exist alone in water it exists as the hydronium ion h3o or other forms h5o2 h9o4 thus an arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water examples include molecular substances such as hydrogen chloride and acetic acid an arrhenius base on the other hand is a substance that increases the concentration of hydroxide oh ions when dissolved in water this decreases the concentration of hydronium because the ions react to form h2o molecules due to this equilibrium any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide thus an arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration while an arrhenius base increases it in an acidic solution the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 107 moles per liter since ph is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions acidic solutions thus have a ph of less than 7 brønstedlowry acidsbrønsted acids while the arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions it is also quite limited in its scope in 1923 chemists johannes nicolaus brønsted and thomas martin lowry independently recognized that acidbase reactions involve the transfer of a proton a brønstedlowry acid or simply brønsted acid is a species that donates a proton to a brønstedlowry base brønstedlowry acidbase theory has several advantages over arrhenius theory consider the following reactions of acetic acid ch3cooh the organic acid that gives vinegar its characteristic taste both theories easily describe the first reaction ch3cooh acts as an arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of h3o when dissolved in water and it acts as a brønsted acid by donating a proton to water in the second example ch3cooh undergoes the same transformation in this case donating a proton to ammonia nh3 but does not relate to the arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium nevertheless ch3cooh is both an arrhenius and a brønstedlowry acid brønstedlowry theory can be used to describe reactions of molecular compounds in nonaqueous solution or the gas phase hydrogen chloride hcl and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form ammonium chloride nh4cl in aqueous solution hcl behaves as hydrochloric acid and exists as hydronium and chloride ions the following reactions illustrate the limitations of arrheniuss definition as with the acetic acid reactions both definitions work for the first example where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the hcl solute the next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still protontransfer reactions in the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia dissolved in benzene react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous hcl and nh3 combine to form the solid lewis acids a third only marginally related concept was proposed in 1923 by gilbert n lewis which includes reactions with acidbase characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer a lewis acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species in other words it is an electron pair acceptor brønsted acidbase reactions are proton transfer reactions while lewis acidbase reactions are electron pair transfers many lewis acids are not brønstedlowry acids contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of acidbase chemistry in the first reaction a fluoride ion f gives up an electron pair to boron trifluoride to form the product tetrafluoroborate fluoride loses a pair of valence electrons because the electrons shared in the bf bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic nuclei and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion bf3 is a lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride this reaction cannot be described in terms of brønsted theory because there is no proton transfer the second reaction can be described using either theory a proton is transferred from an unspecified brønsted acid to ammonia a brønsted base alternatively ammonia acts as a lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion the species that gains the electron pair is the lewis acid for example the oxygen atom in h3o gains a pair of electrons when one of the ho bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen depending on the context a lewis acid may also be described as an oxidizer or an electrophile organic brønsted acids such as acetic citric or oxalic acid are not lewis acids they dissociate in water to produce a lewis acid h but at the same time also yield an equal amount of a lewis base acetate citrate or oxalate respectively for the acids mentioned this article deals mostly with brønsted acids rather than lewis acids dissociation and equilibrium reactions of acids are often generalized in the form ha h  a where ha represents the acid and a is the conjugate base this reaction is referred to as protolysis the protonated form ha of an acid is also sometimes referred to as the free acid acidbase conjugate pairs differ by one proton and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton protonation and deprotonation respectively the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as ha h  a in solution there exists an equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base the equilibrium constant k is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution brackets indicate concentration such that h2o means the concentration of h2o the acid dissociation constant ka is generally used in the context of acidbase reactions the numerical value of ka is equal to the product multiplication of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants where the reactant is the acid ha and the products are the conjugate base and h the stronger of two acids will have a higher ka than the weaker acid the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton because the range of possible values for ka spans many orders of magnitude a more manageable constant pka is more frequently used where pka  log10 ka stronger acids have a smaller pka than weaker acids experimentally determined pka at 25 c in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material nomenclature arrhenius acids are named according to their anions in the classical naming system the ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix according to the table following the prefix hydro is used when the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element for example hcl has chloride as its anion so the hydro prefix is used and the ide suffix makes the name take the form hydrochloric acid classical naming system in the iupac naming system aqueous is simply added to the name of the ionic compound thus for hydrogen chloride as an acid solution the iupac name is aqueous hydrogen chloride acid strength the strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton a strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water in other words one mole of a strong acid ha dissolves in water yielding one mole of h and one mole of the conjugate base a and none of the protonated acid ha in contrast a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid hcl hydroiodic acid hi hydrobromic acid hbr perchloric acid hclo4 nitric acid hno3 and sulfuric acid h2so4 in water each of these essentially ionizes 100 the stronger an acid is the more easily it loses a proton h two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the ha bond and the size of atom a which determines the strength of the ha bond acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base stronger acids have a larger acid dissociation constant ka and a lower pka than weaker acids sulfonic acids which are organic oxyacids are a class of strong acids a common example is toluenesulfonic acid tosylic acid unlike sulfuric acid itself sulfonic acids can be solids in fact polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable superacids are acids stronger than 100 sulfuric acid examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid magic acid and perchloric acid the strongest known acid is helium hydride ion with a proton affinity of 1778kjmol superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic crystalline hydronium salts they can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations while ka measures the strength of an acid compound the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by ph which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution the ph of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compounds ka lewis acid strength in nonaqueous solutions lewis acids have been classified in the ecw model and it has been shown that there is no one order of acid strengths the relative acceptor strength of lewis acids toward a series of bases versus other lewis acids can be illustrated by cb plots it has been shown that to define the order of lewis acid strength at least two properties must be considered for pearsons qualitative hsab theory the two properties are hardness and strength while for dragos quantitative ecw model the two properties are electrostatic and covalent chemical characteristics monoprotic acids monoprotic acids also known as monobasic acids are those acids that are able to donate one proton per molecule during the process of dissociation sometimes called ionization as shown below symbolized by ha common examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid hcl and nitric acid hno3 on the other hand for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid examples in organic acids include formic acid hcooh acetic acid ch3cooh and benzoic acid c6h5cooh polyprotic acids polyprotic acids also known as polybasic acids are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names such as diprotic or dibasic acid two potential protons to donate and triprotic or tribasic acid three potential protons to donate some macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids can have a very large number of acidic protons a diprotic acid here symbolized by h2a can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the ph each dissociation has its own dissociation constant ka1 and ka2 the first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second ie ka1  ka2 for example sulfuric acid h2so4 can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion hso4 for which ka1 is very large then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion so4 wherein the ka2 is intermediate strength the large ka1 for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid in a similar manner the weak unstable carbonic acid h2co3 can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion hco3 and lose a second to form carbonate anion co3 both ka values are small but ka1  ka2  a triprotic acid h3a can undergo one two or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants where ka1  ka2  ka3 an inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid h3po4 usually just called phosphoric acid all three protons can be successively lost to yield h2po4 then hpo4 and finally po4 the orthophosphate ion usually just called phosphate even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent the successive ka values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged an organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable all of the conjugate bases are present in solution the fractional concentration α alpha for each species can be calculated for example a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution h2a ha and a2 the fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the ph which can be converted to the h or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases a plot of these fractional concentrations against ph for given k1 and k2 is known as a bjerrum plot a pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general n protic acid that has been deprotonated i times where k0  1 and the other kterms are the dissociation constants for the acid neutralization neutralization is the reaction between an acid and a base producing a salt and neutralized base for example hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water neutralization is the basis of titration where a ph indicator shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid it is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with ph 70 which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt an example is the weakly acidic ammonium chloride which is produced from the strong acid hydrogen chloride and the weak base ammonia conversely neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt eg sodium fluoride from hydrogen fluoride and sodium hydroxide weak acidweak base equilibrium in order for a protonated acid to lose a proton the ph of the system must rise above the pka of the acid the decreased concentration of h in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form the deprotonated form of the acid in lowerph more acidic solutions there is a high enough h concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form buffer solutions titration to determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution an acidbase titration is commonly performed a strong base solution with a known concentration usually naoh or koh is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added the titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes with the base volume on the xaxis and the solutions ph value on the yaxis the ph of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution example diprotic acid for each diprotic acid titration curve from left to right there are two midpoints two equivalence points and two buffer regions equivalence points due to the successive dissociation processes there are two equivalence points in the titration curve of a diprotic acid the first equivalence point occurs when all first hydrogen ions from the first ionization are titrated in other words the amount of oh added equals the original amount of h2a at the first equivalence point the second equivalence point occurs when all hydrogen ions are titrated therefore the amount of oh added equals twice the amount of h2a at this time for a weak diprotic acid titrated by a strong base the second equivalence point must occur at ph above 7 due to the hydrolysis of the resulted salts in the solution at either equivalence point adding a drop of base will cause the steepest rise of the ph value in the system buffer regions and midpoints a titration curve for a diprotic acid contains two midpoints where phpka since there are two different ka values the first midpoint occurs at phpka1 and the second one occurs at phpka2 each segment of the curve that contains a midpoint at its center is called the buffer region because the buffer regions consist of the acid and its conjugate base it can resist ph changes when base is added until the next equivalent points applications of acids in industry acids are fundamental reagents in treating almost all processes in modern industry sulfuric acid a diprotic acid is the most widely used acid in industry and is also the mostproduced industrial chemical in the world it is mainly used in producing fertilizer detergent batteries and dyes as well as used in processing many products such like removing impurities according to the statistics data in 2011 the annual production of sulfuric acid was around 200 million tonnes in the world for example phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid for the production of phosphate fertilizers and zinc is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid purifying the solution and electrowinning in the chemical industry acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts for example nitric acid reacts with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate a fertilizer additionally carboxylic acids can be esterified with alcohols to produce esters acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as pickling they may be used as an electrolyte in a wet cell battery such as sulfuric acid in a car battery in food tartaric acid is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids citric acid is present in oranges lemon and other citrus fruits oxalic acid is present in tomatoes spinach and especially in carambola and rhubarb rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid ascorbic acid vitamin c is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla indian gooseberry lemon citrus fruits and guava many acids can be found in various kinds of food as additives as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives phosphoric acid for example is a component of cola drinks acetic acid is used in daytoday life as vinegar citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles carbonic acid is one of the most common acid additives that are widely added in soft drinks during the manufacturing process co2 is usually pressurized to dissolve in these drinks to generate carbonic acid carbonic acid is very unstable and tends to decompose into water and co2 at room temperature and pressure therefore when bottles or cans of these kinds of soft drinks are opened the soft drinks fizz and effervesce as co2 bubbles come out certain acids are used as drugs acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers in human bodies acids play important roles in the human body the hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of dna and rna and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes carbonic acid is important for maintenance of ph equilibrium in the body human bodies contain a variety of organic and inorganic compounds among those dicarboxylic acids play an essential role in many biological behaviors many of those acids are amino acids which mainly serve as materials for the synthesis of proteins other weak acids serve as buffers with their conjugate bases to keep the bodys ph from undergoing large scale changes that would be harmful to cells the rest of the dicarboxylic acids also participate in the synthesis of various biologically important compounds in human bodies acid catalysis acids are used as catalysts in industrial and organic chemistry for example sulfuric acid is used in very large quantities in the alkylation process to produce gasoline some acids such as sulfuric phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect dehydration and condensation reactions in biochemistry many enzymes employ acid catalysis biological occurrence thumbleftbasic structure of an amino acidmany biologically important molecules are acids nucleic acids which contain acidic phosphate groups include dna and rna nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organisms characteristics and is passed from parents to offspring dna contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of proteins which are made up of amino acid subunits cell membranes contain fatty acid esters such as phospholipids an αamino acid has a central carbon the α or alpha carbon that is covalently bonded to a carboxyl group thus they are carboxylic acids an amino group a hydrogen atom and a variable group the variable group also called the r group or side chain determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid in glycine the simplest amino acid the r group is a hydrogen atom but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens and may contain other elements such as sulfur oxygen or nitrogen with the exception of glycine naturally occurring amino acids are chiral and almost invariably occur in the lconfiguration peptidoglycan found in some bacterial cell walls contains some damino acids at physiological ph typically around 7 free amino acids exist in a charged form where the acidic carboxyl group cooh loses a proton coo and the basic amine group nh2 gains a proton nh3 the entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a zwitterion with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains aspartic acid for example possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups for a net charge of 1 at physiological ph fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology these contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end the cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a phospholipid bilayer a micelle of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar hydrophilic phosphate head groups membranes contain additional components some of which can participate in acidbase reactions in humans and many other animals hydrochloric acid is a part of the gastric acid secreted within the stomach to help hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides as well as converting the inactive proenzyme pepsinogen into the enzyme pepsin some organisms produce acids for defense for example ants produce formic acid acidbase equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating mammalian breathing oxygen gas o2 drives cellular respiration the process by which animals release the chemical potential energy stored in food producing carbon dioxide co2 as a byproduct oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of ventilation for example during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored carbohydrates and fat releasing co2 into the blood stream in aqueous solutions such as blood co2 exists in equilibrium with carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion it is the decrease in ph that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper expelling the excess co2 and resupplying the cells with o2 thumbrightaspirin acetylsalicylic acid is a carboxylic acid cell membranes are generally impermeable to charged or large polar molecules because of the lipophilic fatty acyl chains comprising their interior many biologically important molecules including a number of pharmaceutical agents are organic weak acids that can cross the membrane in their protonated uncharged form but not in their charged form ie as the conjugate base for this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods the charged form however is often more soluble in blood and cytosol both aqueous environments when the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral ph within the cell certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer acids that lose a proton at the intracellular ph will exist in their soluble charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target ibuprofen aspirin and penicillin are examples of drugs that are weak acids common acids mineral acids inorganic acids sulfonic acids a sulfonic acid has the general formula rso2oh where r is an organic radical carboxylic acids a carboxylic acid has the general formula rcooh where r is an organic radical the carboxyl group cooh contains a carbonyl group co and a hydroxyl group oh halogenated carboxylic acids halogenation at alpha position increases acid strength so that the following acids are all stronger than acetic acid vinylogous carboxylic acids normal carboxylic acids are the direct union of a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group in

chemical mixtures iarc group 2b carcinogens pavements petroleum products road construction materials bitumen uk bit us bih is an immensely viscous constituent of petroleum depending on its exact composition it can be a sticky black liquid or an apparently solid mass that behaves as a liquid over very large time scales in the us the material is commonly referred to as asphalt whether found in natural deposits or refined from petroleum the substance is classed as a pitch prior to the 20th century the term asphaltum was in general use the word derives from the ancient greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos which referred to natural bitumen or pitch the largest natural deposit of bitumen in the world is the pitch lake of southwest trinidad which is estimated to contain 10 million tons 70 of annual bitumen production is destined for road construction its primary use in this application bitumen is used to bind aggregate particles like gravel and forms a substance referred to as asphalt concrete which is colloquially termed asphalt its other main uses lie in bituminous waterproofing products such as roofing felt and roof sealant in material sciences and engineering the terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably and refer both to natural and manufactured forms of the substance although there is regional variation as to which term is most common worldwide geologists tend to favor the term bitumen for the naturally occurring material for the manufactured material which is a refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils bitumen is the prevalent term in much of the world however in american english asphalt is more commonly used to help avoid confusion the phrases liquid asphalt asphalt binder or asphalt cement are used in the us to distinguish it from asphalt concrete colloquially various forms of asphalt are sometimes referred to as tar as in the name of the la brea tar pits naturally occurring bitumen is sometimes specified by the term crude bitumen its viscosity is similar to that of cold molasses while the material obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil boiling at 525 is sometimes referred to as refined bitumen the canadian province of alberta has most of the worlds reserves of natural bitumen in the athabasca oil sands which cover 142000 an area larger than england terminology etymology the latin word traces to the protoindoeuropean root gʷet pitch see that link for other cognates the expression bitumen originated in the sanskrit where we find the words jatu meaning pitch and jatukrit meaning pitch creating pitch producing referring to coniferous or resinous trees the latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally gwitumen pertaining to pitch and by others pixtumens exuding or bubbling pitch which was subsequently shortened to bitumen thence passing via french into english from the same root is derived the anglo saxon word cwidu mastix the german word kitt cement or mastic and the old norse word kvada the word ašphalt is claimed to have been derived from the accadian term asphaltu or sphallo meaning to split it was later adopted by the homeric greeks in the form of the adjective ἄσφαλἤς ἐς signifying firm stable secure and the corresponding verb ἄσφαλίξω ίσω meaning to make firm or stable to secure the word asphalt is derived from the late middle english in turn from french asphalte based on late latin asphalton asphaltum which is the latinisation of the greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos ásphalton a word meaning asphaltbitumenpitch which perhaps derives from ἀ not without ie the alpha privative and σφάλλειν sphallein to cause to fall baffle in passive err in passive be balked of the first use of asphalt by the ancients was as a cement to secure or join various objects and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application specifically herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall from the greek the word passed into late latin and thence into french asphalte and english asphaltum and asphalt in french the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring asphaltsoaked limestone deposits and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the asphaltic concrete used to pave roads modern terminology bitumen mixed with clay was usually called asphaltum but the term is less commonly used today in american english asphalt is equivalent to the british bitumen however asphalt is also commonly used as a shortened form of asphalt concrete therefore equivalent to the british asphalt or tarmac in canadian english the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil while asphalt is used for the oil refinery product diluted bitumen diluted with naphtha to make it flow in pipelines is known as dilbit in the canadian petroleum industry while bitumen upgraded to synthetic crude oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen is called synbit bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semisolid form of petroleum bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen the oil sands of alberta canada are a similar material neither of the terms asphalt or bitumen should be confused with tar or coal tars tar is the thick liquid product of the dry distillation and pyrolysis of organic hydrocarbons primarily sourced from vegetation masses whether fossilized as with coal or freshly harvested the majority of bitumen on the other hand was formed naturally when vast quantities of organic animal materials were deposited by water and buried hundreds of metres deep at the diagenetic point where the disorganized fatty hydrocarbon molecules joined in long chains in the absence of oxygen bitumen occurs as a solid or highly viscous liquid it may even be mixed in with coal deposits bitumen and coal using the bergius process can be refined into petrols such as gasoline and bitumen may be distilled into tar not the other way around composition normal composition the components of bitumen include four main classes of compounds bitumen typically contains elementally 80 by weight of carbon 10 hydrogen up to 6 sulfur and molecularly between 5 and 25 by weight of asphaltenes dispersed in 90 to 65 maltenes most natural bitumens also contain organosulfur compounds nickel and vanadium are found at 10 parts per million as is typical of some petroleum the substance is soluble in carbon disulfide it is commonly modelled as a colloid with asphaltenes as the dispersed phase and maltenes as the continuous phase it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of bitumen because the number of molecules with different chemical structure is extremely large asphalt may be confused with coal tar which is a visually similar black thermoplastic material produced by the destructive distillation of coal during the early and mid20th century when town gas was produced coal tar was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates the addition of coal tar to macadam roads led to the word tarmac which is now used in common parlance to refer to roadmaking materials however since the 1970s when natural gas succeeded town gas bitumen has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications other examples of this confusion include la brea tar pits and the canadian tar sands both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar pitch is another term sometimes informally used at times to refer to asphalt as in pitch lake additives mixtures and contaminants for economic and other reasons bitumen is sometimes sold combined with other materials often without being labeled as anything other than simply bitumen of particular note is the use of rerefined engine oil bottoms  reob or reobssndthe residue of recycled automotive engine oil collected from the bottoms of rerefining vacuum distillation towers in the manufacture of asphalt reob contains various elements and compounds found in recycled engine oil additives to the original oil and materials accumulating from its circulation in the engine typically iron and copper some research has indicated a correlation between this adulteration of bitumen and poorerperforming pavement occurrence the majority of bitumen used commercially is obtained from petroleum nonetheless large amounts of bitumen occur in concentrated form in nature naturally occurring deposits of bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient microscopic algae diatoms and other onceliving things these natural deposits of bitumen have been formed during the carboniferous period when giant swamp forests dominated many parts of the earth they were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where the organisms lived under the heat above 50 c and pressure of burial deep in the earth the remains were transformed into materials such as bitumen kerogen or petroleum natural deposits of bitumen include lakes such as the pitch lake in trinidad and tobago and lake bermudez in venezuela natural seeps occur in the la brea tar pits and the mckittrick tar pits in california as well as in the dead sea bitumen also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as oil sands in alberta canada and the similar tar sands in utah us the canadian province of alberta has most of the worlds reserves in three huge deposits covering 142000 an area larger than england or new york state these bituminous sands contain 166 of commercially established oil reserves giving canada the third largest oil reserves in the world although historically it was used without refining to pave roads nearly all of the output is now used as raw material for oil refineries in canada and the united states the worlds largest deposit of natural bitumen known as the athabasca oil sands is located in the mcmurray formation of northern alberta this formation is from the early cretaceous and is composed of numerous lenses of oilbearing sand with up to 20 oil isotopic studies show the oil deposits to be about 110 million years old two smaller but still very large formations occur in the peace river oil sands and the cold lake oil sands to the west and southeast of the athabasca oil sands respectively of the alberta deposits only parts of the athabasca oil sands are shallow enough to be suitable for surface mining the other 80 has to be produced by oil wells using enhanced oil recovery techniques like steamassisted gravity drainage much smaller heavy oil or bitumen deposits also occur in the uinta basin in utah us the tar sand triangle deposit for example is roughly 6 bitumen bitumen may occur in hydrothermal veins an example of this is within the uinta basin of utah in the us where there is a swarm of laterally and vertically extensive veins composed of a solid hydrocarbon termed gilsonite these veins formed by the polymerization and solidification of hydrocarbons that were mobilized from the deeper oil shales of the green river formation during burial and diagenesis bitumen is similar to the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites however detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct the vast alberta bitumen resources are considered to have started out as living material from marine plants and animals mainly algae that died millions of years ago when an ancient ocean covered alberta they were covered by mud buried deeply over time and gently cooked into oil by geothermal heat at a temperature of 50 due to pressure from the rising of the rocky mountains in southwestern alberta 80 to 55 million years ago the oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres and trapped into underground sand deposits left behind by ancient river beds and ocean beaches thus forming the oil sands history paleolithic times the earliest estimated use of bitumen dates back 40000 years to the paleolithic age in which bitumen was used to adhere handles onto primitive stone tools a reexamination of artifacts uncovered in 1908 at le moustier rock shelters in france has identified mousterian stone tools that were attached to grips made of ochre and bitumen the grips were formulated with 55 ground goethite ochre and 45 cooked liquid bitumen to create a moldable putty that hardened into handles earlier excavations at le moustier prevent conclusive identification of the archaeological culture and age but the european mousterian style of these tools suggests they are associated with neanderthals during the late middle paleolithic between 60000 and 35000 years before present it is the earliest evidence of compound adhesive use in europe ancient times the use of natural bitumen for waterproofing and as an adhesive dates at least to the fifth millennium bc with a crop storage basket discovered in mehrgarh of the indus valley civilization lined with it by the 3rd millennium bc refined rock asphalt was in use in the region and was used to waterproof the great bath in mohenjodaro in the ancient near east the sumerians used natural bitumen deposits for mortar between bricks and stones to cement parts of carvings such as eyes into place for ship caulking and for waterproofing the greek historian herodotus said hot bitumen was used as mortar in the walls of babylon the 1 long euphrates tunnel beneath the river euphrates at babylon in the time of queen semiramis 800 bc was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with bitumen as a waterproofing agent bitumen was used by ancient egyptians to embalm mummies the persian word for asphalt is moom which is related to the english word mummy the egyptians primary source of bitumen was the dead sea which the romans knew as palus asphaltites asphalt lake in approximately 40 ad dioscorides described the dead sea material as judaicum bitumen and noted other places in the region where it could be found the sidon bitumen is thought to refer to material found at hasbeya in lebanon pliny also refers to bitumen being found in epirus bitumen was a valuable strategic resource it was the object of the first known battle for a hydrocarbon deposit  between the seleucids and the nabateans in 312 bc in the ancient far east natural bitumen was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher fractions leaving a thermoplastic material of higher molecular weight that when layered on objects became hard upon cooling this was used to cover objects that needed waterproofing such as scabbards and other items statuettes of household deities were also cast with this type of material in japan and probably also in chinafebruary 2019 in north america archaeological recovery has indicated that bitumen was sometimes used to adhere stone projectile points to wooden shafts in canada aboriginal people used bitumen seeping out of the banks of the athabasca and other rivers to waterproof birch bark canoes and also heated it in smudge pots to ward off mosquitoes in the summer bitumen was also used to waterproof plank canoes used by indigenous peoples in precolonial southern california continental europe in 1553 pierre belon described in his work observations that pissasphalto a mixture of pitch and bitumen was used in the republic of ragusa now dubrovnik croatia for tarring of ships an 1838 edition of mechanics magazine cites an early use of asphalt in france a pamphlet dated 1621 by a certain monsieur deyrinys states that he had discovered the existence of asphaltum in large quantities in the vicinity of neufchatel and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways  principally in the construction of airproof granaries and in protecting by means of the arches the watercourses in the city of paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth which at that time made the water unusable he expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces in palaces the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a parisian of that generation but the substance was generally neglected in france until the revolution of 1830 in the 1830s there was a surge of interest and asphalt became widely used for pavements flat roofs and the lining of cisterns and in england some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes its rise in europe was a sudden phenomenon after natural deposits were found in france at osbann basrhin the parc ain and the puydelapoix puydedôme although it could also be made artificially one of the earliest uses in france was the laying of about 24000 square yards of seyssel asphalt at the place de la concorde in 1835 united kingdom among the earlier uses of bitumen in the united kingdom was for etching william salmons polygraphice 1673 provides a recipe for varnish used in etching consisting of three ounces of virgin wax two ounces of mastic and one ounce of asphaltum by the fifth edition in 1685 he had included more asphaltum recipes from other sources the first british patent for the use of asphalt was cassells patent asphalte or bitumen in 1834 then on 25 november 1837 richard tappin claridge patented the use of seyssel asphalt patent 7849 for use in asphalte pavement having seen it employed in france and belgium when visiting with frederick walter simms who worked with him on the introduction of asphalt to britain dr t lamb phipson writes that his father samuel ryland phipson a friend of claridge was also instrumental in introducing the asphalte pavement in 1836 claridge obtained a patent in scotland on 27 march 1838 and obtained a patent in ireland on 23 april 1838 in 1851 extensions for the 1837 patent and for both 1838 patents were sought by the trustees of a company previously formed by claridge claridges patent asphalte companysndformed in 1838 for the purpose of introducing to britain asphalte in its natural state from the mine at pyrimont seysell in francesndlaid one of the first asphalt pavements in whitehall trials were made of the pavement in 1838 on the footway in whitehall the stable at knightsbridge barracks and subsequently on the space at the bottom of the steps leading from waterloo place to st james park the formation in 1838 of claridges patent asphalte company with a distinguished list of aristocratic patrons and marc and isambard brunel as respectively a trustee and consulting engineer gave an enormous impetus to the development of a british asphalt industry by the end of 1838 at least two other companies robinsons and the bastenne company were in production with asphalt being laid as paving at brighton herne bay canterbury kensington the strand and a large floor area in bunhillrow while meantime claridges whitehall paving continued in good order the bonnington chemical works manufactured asphalt using coal tar and by 1839 had installed it in bonnington in 1838 there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity involving bitumen which had uses beyond paving for example bitumen could also be used for flooring damp proofing in buildings and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths both of which were also proliferating in the 19th century one of the earliest surviving examples of its use can be seen at highgate cemetery where it was used in 1839 to seal the roof of the terrace catacombs on the london stockmarket there were various claims as to the exclusivity of bitumen quality from france germany and england and numerous patents were granted in france with similar numbers of patent applications being denied in england due to their similarity to each other in england claridges was the type most used in the 1840s and 50s in 1914 claridges company entered into a joint venture to produce tarbound macadam with materials manufactured through a subsidiary company called clarmac roads ltd two products resulted namely clarmac and clarphalte with the former being manufactured by clarmac roads and the latter by claridges patent asphalte co although clarmac was more widely used however the first world war ruined the clarmac company which entered into liquidation in 1915 the failure of clarmac roads ltd had a flowon effect to claridges company which was itself compulsorily wound up ceasing operations in 1917 having invested a substantial amount of funds into the new venture both at the outset and in a subsequent attempt to save the clarmac company bitumen was thought in 19th century britain to contain chemicals with medicinal properties extracts from bitumen were used to treat catarrh and some forms of asthma and as a remedy against worms especially the tapeworm united states the first use of bitumen in the new world was by aboriginal peoples on the west coast as early as the 13th century the tongva luiseño and chumash peoples collected the naturally occurring bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits all three groups used the substance as an adhesive it is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items for example it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles it was also used in decorations small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations it was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water possibly poisoning those who drank the water asphalt was used also to seal the planks on oceangoing canoes asphalt was first used to pave streets in the 1870s at first naturally occurring bituminous rock was used such as at ritchie mines in macfarlan in ritchie county west virginia from 1852 to 1873 in 1876 asphaltbased paving was used to pave pennsylvania avenue in washington dc in time for the celebration of the national centennial in the horsedrawn era us streets were mostly unpaved and covered with dirt or gravel especially where mud or trenching often made streets difficult to pass pavements were sometimes made of diverse materials including wooden planks cobble stones or other stone blocks or bricks unpaved roads produced uneven wear and hazards for pedestrians in the late 19th century with the rise of the popular bicycle bicycle clubs were important in pushing for more general pavement of streets advocacy for pavement increased in the early 20th century with the rise of the automobile asphalt gradually became an ever more common method of paving st charles avenue in new orleans was paved its whole length with asphalt by 1889 in 1900 manhattan alone had 130000 horses pulling streetcars wagons and carriages and leaving their waste behind they were not fast and pedestrians could dodge and scramble their way across the crowded streets small towns continued to rely on dirt and gravel but larger cities wanted much better streets they looked to wood or granite blocks by the 1850s in 1890 a third of chicagos 2000 miles of streets were paved chiefly with wooden blocks which gave better traction than mud brick surfacing was a good compromise but even better was asphalt paving which was easy to install and to cut through to get at sewers with london and paris serving as models washington laid 400000 square yards of asphalt paving by 1882 it became the model for buffalo philadelphia and elsewhere by the end of the century american cities boasted 30 million square yards of asphalt paving well ahead of brick the streets became faster and more dangerous so electric traffic lights were installed electric trolleys at 12 miles per hour became the main transportation service for middle class shoppers and office workers until they bought automobiles after 1945 and commuted from more distant suburbs in privacy and comfort on asphalt highways canada canada has the worlds largest deposit of natural bitumen in the athabasca oil sands and canadian first nations along the athabasca river had long used it to waterproof their canoes in 1719 a cree named wapasu brought a sample for trade to henry kelsey of the hudsons bay company who was the first recorded european to see it however it wasnt until 1787 that fur trader and explorer alexander mackenzie saw the athabasca oil sands and said at about 24 miles from the fork of the athabasca and clearwater rivers are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance the value of the deposit was obvious from the start but the means of extracting the bitumen was not the nearest town fort mcmurray alberta was a small fur trading post other markets were far away and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving in 1915 sidney ells of the federal mines branch experimented with separation techniques and used the product to pave 600 feet of road in edmonton alberta other roads in alberta were paved with material extracted from oil sands but it was generally not economic during the 1920s dr karl a clark of the alberta research council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur robert c fitzsimmons built the bitumount oil separation plant which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to 300 per day of bitumen using dr clarks method most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs but other uses included fuels lubrication oils printers ink medicines rust and acidproof paints fireproof roofing street paving patent leather and fence post preservatives eventually fitzsimmons ran out of money and the plant was taken over by the alberta government today the bitumount plant is a provincial historic site photography and art bitumen was used in early photographic technology in 1826 or 1827 it was used by french scientist joseph nicéphore niépce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature the bitumen was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently lightstruck areas remained many hours of exposure in the camera were required making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century although widely used for a time it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting especially when mixed with the most common diluents such as linseed oil varnish and turpentine unless thoroughly diluted bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact the use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings for instance those of delacroix perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is théodore géricaults raft of the medusa 18181819 where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle modern use global use the vast majority of refined bitumen is used in construction primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications according to the requirements of the end use bitumen is produced to specification this is achieved either by refining or blending it is estimated that the current world use of bitumen is approximately 102 million tonnes per year approximately 85 of all the bitumen produced is used as the binder in asphalt concrete for roads it is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways car parks and footways typically the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse aggregates such as sand gravel and crushed rock with asphalt which acts as the binding agent other materials such as recycled polymers eg rubber tyres may be added to the bitumen to modify its properties according to the application for which the bitumen is ultimately intended a further 10 of global bitumen production is used in roofing applications where its waterproofing qualities are invaluable the remaining 5 of bitumen is used mainly for sealing and insulating purposes in a variety of building materials such as pipe coatings carpet tile backing and paint bitumen is applied in the construction and maintenance of many structures systems and components such as rolled asphalt concrete asphalt concretethe largest use of bitumen is for making asphalt concrete for road surfaces this accounts for approximately 85 of the bitumen consumed in the united states there are about 4000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the us and a similar number in europe asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5 bitumen known as asphalt cement in the us and 95 aggregates stone sand and gravel due to its highly viscous nature bitumen must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility the temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the bitumen and the aggregates but warmmix asphalt technologies allow producers to reduce the temperature required the weight of an asphalt pavement depends upon the aggregate type the bitumen and the air void content an average example in the united states is about 112 pounds per square yard per inch of pavement thickness when maintenance is performed on asphalt pavements such as milling to remove a worn or damaged surface the removed material can be returned to a facility for processing into new pavement mixtures the bitumen in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes with some 95 of paved roads being constructed of or surfaced with asphalt a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year according to industry surveys conducted annually by the federal highway administration and the national asphalt pavement association more than 99 of the bitumen removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements roadbeds shoulders and embankments or stockpiled for future use asphalt concrete paving is widely used in airports around the world due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly it is widely used for runways mastic asphalt mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt that differs from dense graded asphalt asphalt concrete in that it has a higher bitumen binder content usually around 710 of the whole aggregate mix as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete which has only around 5 asphalt this thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of 210 and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about 20 thick bitumen emulsion bitumen emulsions are colloidal mixtures of bitumen and water due to the different surface tensions of the two liquids stable emulsions cannot be created simply by mixing therefore various emulsifiers and stabilizers are added emulsifiers are amphiphilic molecules that differ in the charge of their polar head group they reduce the surface tension of the emulsion and thus prevent bitumen particles from fusing the emulsifier charge defines the type of emulsion anionic negatively charged and cationic positively charged the concentration of an emulsifier is a critical parameter affecting the size of the bitumen particleshigher concentrations lead to smaller bitumen particles thus emulsifiers have a great impact on the stability viscosity breaking strength and adhesion of the bitumen emulsion the size of bitumen particles is usually between 01 and 50 µm with a main fraction between 1 µm and 10 µm laser diffraction techniques can be used to determine the particle size distribution quickly and easily cationic emulsifiers primarily include longchain amines such as imidazolines amidoamines and diamines which acquire a positive charge when an acid is added anionic emulsifiers are often fatty acids extracted from lignin tall oil or tree resin saponified with bases such as naoh which creates a negative charge during the storage of bitumen emulsions bitumen particles sediment agglomerate flocculation or fuse coagulation which leads to a certain instability of the bitumen emulsion how fast this process occurs depends on the formulation of the bitumen emulsion but also storage conditions such as temperature and humidity when emulsified bitumen gets into contact with aggregates emulsifiers lose their effectiveness the emulsion breaks down and an adhering bitumen film is formed referred to as breaking bitumen particles almost instantly create a continuous bitumen film by coagulating and separating from water which evaporates not each asphalt emulsion reacts as fast as the other when it gets into contact with aggregates that enables a classification into rapidsetting r slowsetting ss and mediumsetting ms emulsions but also an individual applicationspecific optimization of the formulation and a wide field of application 1 for example slowbreaking emulsions ensure a longer processing time which is particularly advantageous for fine aggregates 1 adhesion problems are reported for anionic emulsions in contact with quartzrich aggregates they are substituted by cationic emulsions achieving better adhesion the extensive range of bitumen emulsions is covered insufficiently by standardization din en 13808 for cationic asphalt emulsions has been existing since july 2005 here a classification of bitumen emulsions based on letters and numbers is described considering charges viscosities and the type of bitumen the production process of bitumen emulsions is very complex two methods are commonly used the colloid mill method and the high internal phase ratio hipr method in the colloid mill method a rotor moves at high speed within a stator by adding bitumen and a wateremulsifier mixture the resulting shear forces generate bitumen particles between 5 µm and 10 µm coated with emulsifiers the high internal phase ratio hipr method is used for creating smaller bitumen particles monomodal narrow particle size distributions and very high bitumen concentrations here a highly concentrated bitumen emulsion is produced first by moderate stirring and diluted afterward in contrast to the colloidmill method the aqueous phase is introduced into hot bitumen enabling very high bitumen concentrations t the high internal phase ratio hipr method is used for creating smaller bitumen particles monomodal narrow particle size distributions and very high bitumen concentrations

bitumen enabling very high bitumen concentrations 1 bitumen emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications they are used in road construction and building protection and primarily include the application in cold recycling mixtures adhesive coating and surface treatment 1 due to the lower viscosity in comparison to hot bitumen processing requires less energy and is associated with significantly less risk of fire and burns chipseal involves spraying the road surface with bitumen emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock gravel or crushed slag slurry seal is a mixture of bitumen emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road coldmixed asphalt can also be made from bitumen emulsion to create pavements similar to hotmixed asphalt several inches in depth and bitumen emulsions are also blended into recycled hotmix asphalt to create lowcost pavements bitumen emulsion based techniques are known to be useful for all classes of roads their use may also be possible in the following applications 1 asphalts for heavily trafficked roads based on the use of polymer modified emulsions 2 warm emulsion based mixtures to improve both their maturation time and mechanical properties 3 halfwarm technology in which aggregates are heated up to 100 degrees producing mixtures with similar properties to those of hot asphalts 4 high performance surface dressing synthetic crude oil synthetic crude oil also known as syncrude is the output from a bitumen upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production in canada bituminous sands are mined using enormous 100ton capacity power shovels and loaded into even larger 400ton capacity dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility the process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by dr karl clark of the university of alberta during the 1920s after extraction from the sand the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent this synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment by 2015 canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over 1 per day of synthetic crude oil of which 75 was exported to oil refineries in the united states in alberta five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety of other products the suncor energy upgrader near fort mcmurray alberta produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel fuel the syncrude canada canadian natural resources and nexen upgraders near fort mcmurray produce synthetic crude oil and the shell scotford upgrader near edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby shell oil refinery a sixth upgrader under construction in 2015 near redwater alberta will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants nonupgraded crude bitumen canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as venezuelan extraheavy and mexican heavy oil in chemical composition and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through oil pipelines to the refinery many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process nonupgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline diesel fuel and refined asphalt without any preprocessing this is particularly common in areas such as the us gulf coast where refineries were designed to process venezuelan and mexican oil and in areas such as the us midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined given the choice such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline by 2015 canadian production and exports of nonupgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over 13 per day of which about 65 was exported to the united states because of the difficulty of moving crude bitumen through pipelines nonupgraded bitumen is usually diluted with naturalgas condensate in a form called dilbit or with synthetic crude oil called synbit however to meet international competition much nonupgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen conventional crude oil synthetic crude oil and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as western canadian select this sour heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as mexican mayan or arabian dubai crude radioactive waste encapsulation matrix bitumen was used starting in the 1960s as a hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as mediumactivity salts mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alphaemitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in france belgium and japan but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues risks of fire as occurred in a bituminisation plant at tokai works in japan and longterm stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations one of the main problems is the swelling of bitumen exposed to radiation and to water bitumen swelling is first induced by radiation because of the presence of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis a second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve the high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix the water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts the bitumen acting as a semipermeable membrane this also causes the matrix to swell the swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar if not properly managed this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised mediumlevel waste when the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere the high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks the presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions preventing the reduction of redoxsensitive radionuclides under their higher valences radionuclides of elements such as selenium technetium uranium neptunium and plutonium have a higher solubility and are also often present in water as nonretarded anions this makes the disposal of mediumlevel bituminised waste very challenging different types of bitumen have been used blown bitumen partly oxidized with air oxygen at high temperature after distillation and harder and direct distillation bitumen softer blown bitumens like mexphalte with a high content of saturated hydrocarbons are more easily biodegraded by microorganisms than direct distillation bitumen with a low content of saturated hydrocarbons and a high content of aromatic hydrocarbons concrete encapsulation of radwaste is presently considered a safer alternative by the nuclear industry and the waste management organisations other uses roofing shingles and roll roofing account for most of the remaining bitumen consumption other uses include cattle sprays fencepost treatments and waterproofing for fabrics bitumen is used to make japan black a lacquer known especially for its use on iron and steel and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some exterior paint supply companies to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint or ink and to make the color darkerfebruary 2019 bitumen is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process production about 164000000 tons were produced in 2019 it is obtained as the heavy ie difficult to distill fraction material with a boiling point greater than around 500 c is considered asphalt vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil such as naphtha gasoline and diesel the resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications in a deasphalting unit the crude bitumen is treated with either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to extract the lighter molecules which are then separated further processing is possible by blowing the product namely reacting it with oxygen this step makes the product harder and more viscous bitumen is typically stored and transported at temperatures around 150 sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity upon delivery these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture this mixture is often called bitumen feedstock or bfs some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm the backs of tippers carrying asphalt as well as some handling equipment are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release diesel oil is no longer used as a release agent due to environmental concerns oil sands naturally occurring crude bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from oil sands currently under development in alberta canada canada has most of the worlds supply of natural bitumen covering 140000 square kilometres an area larger than england giving it the secondlargest proven oil reserves in the world the athabasca oil sands are the largest bitumen deposit in canada and the only one accessible to surface mining although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by in situ methods because of oil price increases after 2003 producing bitumen became highly profitable but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again by 2014 canadian crude bitumen production averaged about 23 per day and was projected to rise to 44 per day by 2020 the total amount of crude bitumen in alberta that could be extracted is estimated to be about 310 which at a rate of 4400000 would last about 200 years alternatives and bioasphalt although uncompetitive economically bitumen can be made from nonpetroleumbased renewable resources such as sugar molasses and rice corn and potato starches bitumen can also be made from waste material by fractional distillation of used motor oil which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills use of motor oil may cause premature cracking in colder climates resulting in roads that need to be repaved more frequently nonpetroleumbased asphalt binders can be made lightcolored lightercolored roads absorb less heat from solar radiation reducing their contribution to the urban heat island effect parking lots that use bitumen alternatives are called green parking lots albanian deposits selenizza is a naturally occurring solid hydrocarbon bitumen found in native deposits in selenice in albania the only european asphalt mine still in use the bitumen is found in the form of veins filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction the bitumen content varies from 83 to 92 soluble in carbon disulphide with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point ring and ball around 120 c the insoluble matter consisting mainly of silica ore ranges from 8 to 17 albanian bitumen extraction has a long history and was practiced in an organized way by the romans after centuries of silence the first mentions of albanian bitumen appeared only in 1868 when the frenchman coquand published the first geological description of the deposits of albanian bitumen in 1875 the exploitation rights were granted to the ottoman government and in 1912 they were transferred to the italian company simsa since 1945 the mine was exploited by the albanian government and from 2001 to date the management passed to a french company which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the natural bitumen on an industrial scale today the mine is predominantly exploited in an open pit quarry but several of the many underground mines deep and extending over several km still remain viable selenizza is produced primarily in granular form after melting the bitumen pieces selected in the mine selenizza is mainly used as an additive in the road construction sector it is mixed with traditional bitumen to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing it may be blended with the hot bitumen in tanks but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks bridges carparks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for the oil and gas industry selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in sacks or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags a lifecycle assessment study of the natural selenizza compared with petroleum bitumen has shown that the environmental impact of the selenizza is about half the impact of the road asphalt produced in oil refineries in terms of carbon dioxide emission recycling bitumen is a commonly recycled material in the construction industry the two most common recycled materials that contain bitumen are reclaimed asphalt pavement rap and reclaimed asphalt shingles ras rap is recycled at a greater rate than any other material in the united states and typically contains approximately 56 bitumen binder asphalt shingles typically contain 2040 bitumen binder bitumen naturally becomes stiffer over time due to oxidation evaporation exudation and physical hardening for this reason recycled asphalt is typically combined with virgin asphalt softening agents andor rejuvenating additives to restore its physical and chemical properties economics although bitumen typically makes up only 4 to 5 percent by weight of the pavement mixture as the pavements binder it is also the most expensive part of the cost of the roadpaving material during bitumens early use in modern paving oil refiners gave it away however bitumen is a highly traded commodity today its prices increased substantially in the early 21st century a us government report states the report indicates that an average 1mile 16kilometerlong fourlane highway would include 300 tons of asphalt which in 2002 would have cost around 48000 by 2006 this would have increased to 96000 and by 2012 to 183000 an increase of about 135000 for every mile of highway in just 10 years health and safety people can be exposed to bitumen in the workplace by breathing in fumes or skin absorption the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit of 5 mgm3 over a 15minute period bitumen is basically an inert material that must be heated or diluted to a point where it becomes workable for the production of materials for paving roofing and other applications in examining the potential health hazards associated with bitumen the international agency for research on cancer iarc determined that it is the application parameters predominantly temperature that affect occupational exposure and the potential bioavailable carcinogenic hazardrisk of the bitumen emissions in particular temperatures greater than 199 c 390 f were shown to produce a greater exposure risk than when bitumen was heated to lower temperatures such as those typically used in asphalt pavement mix production and placement iarc has classified paving asphalt fumes as a class 2b possible carcinogen indicating inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans in 2020 scientists reported that bitumen currently is a significant and largely overlooked source of air pollution in urban areas especially during hot and sunny periods a bitumenlike substance found in the himalayas and known as shilajit is sometimes used as an ayurveda medicine but is not in fact a tar resin or bitumen see also notes references sources

missions neil armstrong articles containing video clips michael collins astronaut crewed missions to the moon soft landings on the moon spacecraft launched by saturn rockets apollo 11 july 1624 1969 was the american spaceflight that first landed humans on the moon commander neil armstrong and lunar module pilot buzz aldrin landed the apollo lunar module eagle on july 20 1969 at 2017 utc and armstrong became the first person to step onto the moons surface six hours and 39 minutes later on july 21 at 0256 utc aldrin joined him 19 minutes later and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named tranquility base upon landing armstrong and aldrin collected 475 of lunar material to bring back to earth as pilot michael collins flew the command module columbia in lunar orbit and were on the moons surface for 21 hours 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin columbia apollo 11 was launched by a saturn v rocket from kennedy space center on merritt island florida on july 16 at 1332 utc and it was the fifth crewed mission of nasas apollo program the apollo spacecraft had three parts a command module cm with a cabin for the three astronauts the only part that returned to earth a service module sm which supported the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and water and a lunar module lm that had two stagesa descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit after being sent to the moon by the saturn vs third stage the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit armstrong and aldrin then moved into eagle and landed in the sea of tranquility on july 20 the astronauts used eagles ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin collins in the command module they jettisoned eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to earth they returned to earth and splashed down in the pacific ocean on july 24 after more than eight days in space armstrongs first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live tv to a worldwide audience he described the event as one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind apollo 11 effectively proved us victory in the space race to demonstrate spaceflight superiority by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by president john f kennedy before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth background in the late 1950s and early 1960s the united states was engaged in the cold war a geopolitical rivalry with the soviet union on october 4 1957 the soviet union launched sputnik 1 the first artificial satellite this surprise success fired fears and imaginations around the world it demonstrated that the soviet union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances and challenged american claims of military economic and technological superiority this precipitated the sputnik crisis and triggered the space race to prove which superpower would achieve superior spaceflight capability president dwight d eisenhower responded to the sputnik challenge by creating the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and initiating project mercury which aimed to launch a man into earth orbit but on april 12 1961 soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person in space and the first to orbit the earth nearly a month later on may 5 1961 alan shepard became the first american in space completing a 15minute suborbital journey after being recovered from the atlantic ocean he received a congratulatory telephone call from eisenhowers successor john f kennedy since the soviet union had higher lift capacity launch vehicles kennedy chose from among options presented by nasa a challenge beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry so that the us and soviet union would be starting from a position of equality a crewed mission to the moon would serve this purpose on may 25 1961 kennedy addressed the united states congress on urgent national needs and declared on september 12 1962 kennedy delivered another speech before a crowd of about 40000 people in the rice university football stadium in houston texas a widely quoted refrain from the middle portion of the speech reads as follows in spite of that the proposed program faced the opposition of many americans and was dubbed a moondoggle by norbert wiener a mathematician at the massachusetts institute of technology the effort to land a man on the moon already had a name project apollo when kennedy met with nikita khrushchev the premier of the soviet union in june 1961 he proposed making the moon landing a joint project but khrushchev did not take up the offer kennedy again proposed a joint expedition to the moon in a speech to the united nations general assembly on september 20 1963 the idea of a joint moon mission was abandoned after kennedys death an early and crucial decision was choosing lunar orbit rendezvous over both direct ascent and earth orbit rendezvous a space rendezvous is an orbital maneuver in which two spacecraft navigate through space and meet up in july 1962 nasa head james webb announced that lunar orbit rendezvous would be used and that the apollo spacecraft would have three major parts a command module cm with a cabin for the three astronauts and the only part that returned to earth a service module sm which supported the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and water and a lunar module lm that had two stagesa descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit this design meant the spacecraft could be launched by a single saturn v rocket that was then under development technologies and techniques required for apollo were developed by project gemini the apollo project was enabled by nasas adoption of new advances in semiconductor electronic technology including metaloxidesemiconductor fieldeffect transistors mosfets in the interplanetary monitoring platform imp and silicon integrated circuit ic chips in the apollo guidance computer agc project apollo was abruptly halted by the apollo 1 fire on january 27 1967 in which astronauts gus grissom ed white and roger b chaffee died and the subsequent investigation in october 1968 apollo 7 evaluated the command module in earth orbit and in december apollo 8 tested it in lunar orbit in march 1969 apollo 9 put the lunar module through its paces in earth orbit and in may apollo 10 conducted a dress rehearsal in lunar orbit by july 1969 all was in readiness for apollo 11 to take the final step onto the moon the soviet union appeared to be winning the space race by beating the us to firsts but its early lead was overtaken by the us gemini program and soviet failure to develop the n1 launcher which would have been comparable to the saturn v the soviets tried to beat the us to return lunar material to the earth by means of uncrewed probes on july 13 three days before apollo 11s launch the soviet union launched luna 15 which reached lunar orbit before apollo 11 during descent a malfunction caused luna 15 to crash in mare crisium about two hours before armstrong and aldrin took off from the moons surface to begin their voyage home the nuffield radio astronomy laboratories radio telescope in england recorded transmissions from luna 15 during its descent and these were released in july 2009 for the 40th anniversary of apollo 11 personnel prime crew the initial crew assignment of commander neil armstrong command module pilot cmp jim lovell and lunar module pilot lmp buzz aldrin on the backup crew for apollo 9 was officially announced on november 20 1967 lovell and aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of gemini 12 due to design and manufacturing delays in the lm apollo 8 and apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews and armstrongs crew became the backup for apollo 8 based on the normal crew rotation scheme armstrong was then expected to command apollo 11 there would be one change michael collins the cmp on the apollo 8 crew began experiencing trouble with his legs doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae requiring surgery lovell took his place on the apollo 8 crew and when collins recovered he joined armstrongs crew as cmp in the meantime fred haise filled in as backup lmp and aldrin as backup cmp for apollo 8 apollo 11 was the second american mission where all the crew members had prior spaceflight experience the first being apollo 10 the next was sts26 in 1988 deke slayton gave armstrong the option to replace aldrin with lovell since some thought aldrin was difficult to work with armstrong had no issues working with aldrin but thought it over for a day before declining he thought lovell deserved to command his own mission eventually apollo 13 the apollo 11 prime crew had none of the close cheerful camaraderie characterized by that of apollo 12 instead they forged an amiable working relationship armstrong in particular was notoriously aloof but collins who considered himself a loner confessed to rebuffing aldrins attempts to create a more personal relationship aldrin and collins described the crew as amiable strangers armstrong did not agree with the assessment and said  all the crews i was on worked very well together backup crew the backup crew consisted of lovell as commander william anders as cmp and haise as lmp anders had flown with lovell on apollo 8 in early 1969 anders accepted a job with the national aeronautics and space council effective august 1969 and announced he would retire as an astronaut at that time ken mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with anders as backup cmp in case apollo 11 was delayed past its intended july launch date at which point anders would be unavailable by the normal crew rotation in place during apollo lovell mattingly and haise were scheduled to fly on apollo 14 but the three of them were bumped to apollo 13 there was a crew issue for apollo 13 as none of them except edgar mitchell flew in space again george mueller rejected the crew and this was the first time an apollo crew was rejected to give alan shepard more training time lovells crew were bumped to apollo 13 mattingly would later be replaced by jack swigert as cmp on apollo 13 support crew during projects mercury and gemini each mission had a prime and a backup crew for apollo a third crew of astronauts was added known as the support crew the support crew maintained the flight plan checklists and mission ground rules and ensured the prime and backup crews were apprised of changes they developed procedures especially those for emergency situations so these were ready for when the prime and backup crews came to train in the simulators allowing them to concentrate on practicing and mastering them for apollo 11 the support crew consisted of ken mattingly ronald evans and bill pogue capsule communicators the capsule communicator capcom was an astronaut at the mission control center in houston texas who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew for apollo 11 the capcoms were charles duke ronald evans bruce mccandless ii james lovell william anders ken mattingly fred haise don l lind owen k garriott and harrison schmitt flight directors the flight directors for this mission were other key personnel other key personnel who played important roles in the apollo 11 mission include the following preparations insignia the apollo 11 mission emblem was designed by collins who wanted a symbol for peaceful lunar landing by the united states at lovells suggestion he chose the bald eagle the national bird of the united states as the symbol tom wilson a simulator instructor suggested an olive branch in its beak to represent their peaceful mission collins added a lunar background with the earth in the distance the sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction the shadow should have been in the lower part of the earth instead of the left aldrin armstrong and collins decided the eagle and the moon would be in their natural colors and decided on a blue and gold border armstrong was concerned that eleven would not be understood by nonenglish speakers so they went with apollo 11 and they decided not to put their names on the patch so it would be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing an illustrator at the manned spacecraft center msc did the artwork which was then sent off to nasa officials for approval the design was rejected bob gilruth the director of the msc felt the talons of the eagle looked too warlike after some discussion the olive branch was moved to the talons when the eisenhower dollar coin was released in 1971 the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side the design was also used for the smaller susan b anthony dollar unveiled in 1979 call signs after the crew of apollo 10 named their spacecraft charlie brown and snoopy assistant manager for public affairs julian scheer wrote to george low the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office at the msc to suggest the apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft the name snowcone was used for the cm and haystack was used for the lm in both internal and external communications during early mission planning the lm was named eagle after the motif which was featured prominently on the mission insignia at scheers suggestion the cm was named columbia after columbiad the giant cannon that launched a spacecraft also from florida in jules vernes 1865 novel from the earth to the moon it also referred to columbia a historical name of the united states in collins 1976 book he said columbia was in reference to christopher columbus mementos the astronauts had personal preference kits ppks small bags containing personal items of significance they wanted to take with them on the mission five 05 ppks were carried on apollo 11 three one for each astronaut were stowed on columbia before launch and two on eagle neil armstrongs lm ppk contained a piece of wood from the wright brothers 1903 wright flyers left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing along with a diamondstudded astronaut pin originally given to slayton by the widows of the apollo 1 crew this pin had been intended to be flown on that mission and given to slayton afterwards but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals the widows gave the pin to slayton armstrong took it with him on apollo 11 site selection nasas apollo site selection board announced five potential landing sites on february 8 1968 these were the result of two years worth of studies based on highresolution photography of the lunar surface by the five uncrewed probes of the lunar orbiter program and information about surface conditions provided by the surveyor program the best earthbound telescopes could not resolve features with the resolution project apollo required the landing site had to be close to the lunar equator to minimize the amount of propellant required clear of obstacles to minimize maneuvering and flat to simplify the task of the landing radar scientific value was not a consideration areas that appeared promising on photographs taken on earth were often found to be totally unacceptable the original requirement that the site be free of craters had to be relaxed as no such site was found five sites were considered sites 1 and 2 were in the sea of tranquility mare tranquillitatis site 3 was in the central bay sinus medii and sites 4 and 5 were in the ocean of storms oceanus procellarum the final site selection was based on seven criteria the requirement for the sun angle was particularly restrictive limiting the launch date to one day per month a landing just after dawn was chosen to limit the temperature extremes the astronauts would experience the apollo site selection board selected site 2 with sites 3 and 5 as backups in the event of the launch being delayed in may 1969 apollo 10s lunar module flew to within 15 of site 2 and reported it was acceptable firststep decision during the first press conference after the apollo 11 crew was announced the first question was which one of you gentlemen will be the first man to step onto the lunar surface slayton told the reporter it had not been decided and armstrong added that it was not based on individual desire one of the first versions of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot exit the spacecraft before the commander which matched what had been done on gemini missions where the commander had never performed the spacewalk reporters wrote in early 1969 that aldrin would be the first man to walk on the moon and associate administrator george mueller told reporters he would be first as well aldrin heard that armstrong would be the first because armstrong was a civilian which made aldrin livid aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict slayton told aldrin that armstrong would be first since he was the commander the decision was announced in a press conference on april 14 1969 for decades aldrin believed the final decision was largely driven by the lunar modules hatch location because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and the spacecraft was so small maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult the crew tried a simulation in which aldrin left the spacecraft first but he damaged the simulator while attempting to egress while this was enough for mission planners to make their decision aldrin and armstrong were left in the dark on the decision until late spring slayton told armstrong the plan was to have him leave the spacecraft first if he agreed armstrong said yes thats the way to do it the media accused armstrong of exercising his commanders prerogative to exit the spacecraft first chris kraft revealed in his 2001 autobiography that a meeting occurred between gilruth slayton low and himself to make sure aldrin would not be the first to walk on the moon they argued that the first person to walk on the moon should be like charles lindbergh a calm and quiet person they made the decision to change the flight plan so the commander was the first to egress from the spacecraft prelaunch the ascent stage of lm5 eagle arrived at the kennedy space center on january 8 1969 followed by the descent stage four days later and csm107 columbia on january 23 there were several differences between eagle and apollo 10s lm4 snoopy eagle had a vhf radio antenna to facilitate communication with the astronauts during their eva on the lunar surface a lighter ascent engine more thermal protection on the landing gear and a package of scientific experiments known as the early apollo scientific experiments package easep the only change in the configuration of the command module was the removal of some insulation from the forward hatch the csm was mated on january 29 and moved from the operations and checkout building to the vehicle assembly building on april 14 the sivb third stage of saturn v as506 had arrived on january 18 followed by the sii second stage on february 6 sic first stage on february 20 and the saturn v instrument unit on february 27 at 1230 on may 20 the 5443 assembly departed the vehicle assembly building atop the crawlertransporter bound for launch pad 39a part of launch complex 39 while apollo 10 was still on its way to the moon a countdown test commenced on june 26 and concluded on july 2 the launch complex was floodlit on the night of july 15 when the crawlertransporter carried the mobile service structure back to its parking area in the early hours of the morning the fuel tanks of the sii and sivb stages were filled with liquid hydrogen fueling was completed by three hours before launch launch operations were partly automated with 43 programs written in the atoll programming language slayton roused the crew shortly after 0400 and they showered shaved and had the traditional preflight breakfast of steak and eggs with slayton and the backup crew they then donned their space suits and began breathing pure oxygen at 0630 they headed out to launch complex 39 haise entered columbia about three hours and ten minutes before launch time along with a technician he helped armstrong into the lefthand couch at 0654 five minutes later collins joined him taking up his position on the righthand couch finally aldrin entered taking the center couch haise left around two hours and ten minutes before launch the closeout crew sealed the hatch and the cabin was purged and pressurized the closeout crew then left the launch complex about an hour before launch time the countdown became automated at three minutes and twenty seconds before launch time over 450 personnel were at the consoles in the firing room mission launch and flight to lunar orbit an estimated one million spectators watched the launch of apollo 11 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of the launch site dignitaries included the chief of staff of the united states army general william westmoreland four cabinet members 19 state governors 40 mayors 60 ambassadors and 200 congressmen vice president spiro agnew viewed the launch with former president lyndon b johnson and his wife lady bird johnson around 3500 media representatives were present about twothirds were from the united states the rest came from 55 other countries the launch was televised live in 33 countries with an estimated 25 million viewers in the united states alone millions more around the world listened to radio broadcasts president richard nixon viewed the launch from his office in the white house with his nasa liaison officer apollo astronaut frank borman saturn v as506 launched apollo 11 on july 16 1969 at 133200 utc 93200 edt at 132 seconds into the flight the launch vehicle began to roll into its flight azimuth of 72058 full shutdown of the firststage engines occurred about 2 minutes and 42 seconds into the mission followed by separation of the sic and ignition of the sii engines the second stage engines then cut off and separated at about 9 minutes and 8 seconds allowing the first ignition of the sivb engine a few seconds later apollo 11 entered a nearcircular earth orbit at an altitude of 1004 by 989 twelve minutes into its flight after one and a half orbits a second ignition of the sivb engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the moon with the translunar injection tli burn at 162213 utc about 30 minutes later with collins in the left seat and at the controls the transposition docking and extraction maneuver was performed this involved separating columbia from the spent sivb stage turning around and docking with eagle still attached to the stage after the lm was extracted the combined spacecraft headed for the moon while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the moon this was done to avoid the third stage colliding with the spacecraft the earth or the moon a slingshot effect from passing around the moon threw it into an orbit around the sun on july 19 at 172150 utc apollo 11 passed behind the moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit in the thirty orbits that followed the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern sea of tranquility about 12 southwest of the crater sabine d the site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated ranger 8 and surveyor 5 landers and the lunar orbiter mapping spacecraft and because it was unlikely to present major landing or eva challenges it lay about 25 southeast of the surveyor 5 landing site and 68 southwest of ranger 8s crash site lunar descent at 125200 utc on july 20 aldrin and armstrong entered eagle and began the final preparations for lunar descent at 174400 eagle separated from columbia collins alone aboard columbia inspected eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged and that the landing gear was correctly deployed armstrong exclaimed the eagle has wings as the descent began armstrong and aldrin found themselves passing landmarks on the surface two or three seconds early and reported that they were long they would land miles west of their target point eagle was traveling too fast the problem could have been masconsconcenshytrashytions of high mass in a region or regions of the moons crust that contains a gravitational anomaly potentially altering eagles trajectory flight director gene kranz speculated that it could have resulted from extra air pressure in the docking tunnel or a result of eagles pirouette maneuver five minutes into the descent burn and 6000 above the surface of the moon the lm guidance computer lgc distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected 1201 and 1202 program alarms inside mission control center computer engineer jack garman told guidance officer steve bales it was safe to continue the descent and this was relayed to the crew the program alarms indicated executive overflows meaning the guidance computer could not complete all its tasks in realtime and had to postpone some of them margaret hamilton the director of apollo flight computer programming at the mit charles stark draper laboratory later recalled during the mission the cause was diagnosed as the rendezvous radar switch being in the wrong position causing the computer to process data from both the rendezvous and landing radars at the same time software engineer don eyles concluded in a 2005 guidance and control conference paper that the problem was due to a hardware design bug previously seen during testing of the first uncrewed lm in apollo 5 having the rendezvous radar on so it was warmed up in case of an emergency landing abort should have been irrelevant to the computer but an electrical phasing mismatch between two parts of the rendezvous radar system could cause the stationary antenna to appear to the computer as dithering back and forth between two positions depending upon how the hardware randomly powered up the extra spurious cycle stealing as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter caused the computer alarms landing when armstrong again looked outside he saw that the computers landing target was in a boulderstrewn area just north and east of a 300 crater later determined to be west crater so he took semiautomatic control armstrong considered landing short of the boulder field so they could collect geological samples from it but could not since their horizontal velocity was too high throughout the descent aldrin called out navigation data to armstrong who was busy piloting eagle now 107 above the surface armstrong knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the first possible landing site armstrong found a clear patch of ground and maneuvered the spacecraft towards it as he got closer now 250 above the surface he discovered his new landing site had a crater in it he cleared the crater and found another patch of level ground they were now 100 from the surface with only 90 seconds of propellant remaining lunar dust kicked up by the lms engine began to impair his ability to determine the spacecrafts motion some large rocks jutted out of the dust cloud and armstrong focused on them during his descent so he could determine the spacecrafts speed a light informed aldrin that at least one of the 67 probes hanging from eagles footpads had touched the surface a few moments before the landing and he said contact light armstrong was supposed to immediately shut the engine down as the engineers suspected the pressure caused by the engines own exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface could make it explode but he forgot three seconds later eagle landed and armstrong shut the engine down aldrin immediately said okay engine stop acaout of detent armstrong acknowledged out of detent auto aldrin continued mode controlboth auto descent engine command override off engine armoff 413 is in aca was the attitude control assemblythe lms control stick output went to the lgc to command the reaction control system rcs jets to fire out of detent meant the stick had moved away from its centered position it was springcentered like the turn indicator in a car address 413 of the abort guidance system ags contained the variable that indicated the lm had landed eagle landed at 201740 utc on sunday july 20 with 216 of usable fuel remaining information available to the crew and mission controllers during the landing showed the lm had enough fuel for another 25 seconds of powered flight before an abort without touchdown would have become unsafe but postmission analysis showed that the real figure was probably closer to 50 seconds apollo 11 landed with less fuel than most subsequent missions and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning this was later found to be the result of the propellant sloshing more than expected uncovering a fuel sensor on subsequent missions extra antislosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this armstrong acknowledged aldrins completion of the postlanding checklist with engine arm is off before responding to the capcom charles duke with the words houston tranquility base here the eagle has landed armstrongs unrehearsed change of call sign from eagle to tranquility base emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful duke expressed the relief at mission control roger twantranquility we copy you on the ground you got a bunch of guys about to turn blue were breathing again thanks a lot two and a half hours after landing before preparations began for the eva aldrin radioed to earth he then took communion privately at this time nasa was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist madalyn murray ohair who had objected to the apollo 8 crew reading from the book of genesis demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space for this reason aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the moon aldrin was an elder at the webster presbyterian church and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church dean woodruff webster presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the moon and commemorates the event each year on the sunday closest to july 20 the schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a fivehour sleep period but they chose to begin preparations for the eva early thinking they would be unable to sleep lunar surface operations preparations for neil armstrong and buzz aldrin to walk on the moon began at 2343 utc these took longer than expected three and a half hours instead of two during training on earth everything required had been neatly laid out in advance but on the moon the cabin contained a large number of other items as well such as checklists food packets and tools six hours and thirtynine minutes after landing armstrong and aldrin were ready to go outside and eagle was depressurized eagles hatch was opened at 023933 armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his portable life support system plss some of the highest heart rates recorded from apollo astronauts occurred during lm egress and ingress at 0251 armstrong began his descent to the lunar surface the remote control unit on his chest kept him from seeing his feet climbing down the ninerung ladder armstrong pulled a dring to deploy the modular equipment stowage assembly mesa folded against eagles side and activate the tv camera apollo 11 used slowscan television tv incompatible with broadcast tv so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional tv camera viewed this monitor thus a broadcast of a broadcast significantly reducing the quality of the picture the signal was received at goldstone in the united states but with better fidelity by honeysuckle creek tracking station near canberra in australia minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive parkes radio telescope in australia despite some technical and weather difficulties black and white images of the first lunar eva were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on earth copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available but recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were likely destroyed during routine magnetic tape reuse at nasa after describing the surface dust as very finegrained and almost like a powder at 025615 six and a half hours after landing armstrong stepped off eagles landing pad and declared thats one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind armstrong intended to say thats one small step for a man but the word a is not audible in the transmission and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast when later asked about his quote armstrong said he believed he said for a man and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the a in square brackets one explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words for a together another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to earth partly because of storms near parkes observatory a more recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the a may have been spoken but obscured by static other analysis points to the claims of static and slurring as facesaving fabrication and that armstrong himself later admitted to misspeaking the line about seven minutes after stepping onto the moons surface armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick he then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh this was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the eva and return to the lm twelve minutes after the sample was collected he removed the tv camera from the mesa and made a panoramic sweep then mounted it on a tripod the tv camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the eva still photography was accomplished with a hasselblad camera that could be operated handheld or mounted on armstrongs apollo space suit aldrin joined armstrong on the surface he described the view with the simple phrase magnificent desolation armstrong said moving in the lunar gravity onesixth of earths was even perhaps easier than the simulations  its absolutely no trouble to walk around aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around including twofooted kangaroo hops the plss backpack created a tendency to tip backward but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance loping became the preferred method of movement the astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead the fine soil was quite slippery aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into eagles shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit but the helmet was warmer in sunlight so he felt cooler in shadow the mesa failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow slowing work somewhat as they worked the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits the astronauts planted the lunar flag assembly containing a flag of the united states on the lunar surface in clear view of the tv camera aldrin remembered of all the jobs i had to do on the moon the one i wanted to go the smoothest was the flag raising but the astronauts struggled with the telescoping rod and could only insert the pole about 5 into the hard lunar surface aldrin was afraid it might topple in front of tv viewers but gave a crisp west point salute before aldrin could take a photo of armstrong with the flag president richard nixon spoke to them through a telephoneradio transmission which nixon called the most historic phone call ever made from the white house nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call but frank borman who was at the white house as a nasa liaison during apollo 11 convinced nixon to keep his words brief armstrong thank you mr president its a great honor and privilege for us to be here representing not only the united states but men of peace of all nations and with interest and a curiosity and men with a vision for the future its an honor for us to be able to participate here today they deployed the easep which included a passive seismic experiment package used to measure moonquakes and a retroreflector array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment then armstrong walked 196 from the lm to take photographs at the rim of little west crater while aldrin collected two core samples he used the geologists hammer to pound in the tubesthe only time the hammer was used on apollo 11but was unable to penetrate more than 6 deep the astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles many of the surface activities took longer than expected so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes aldrin shoveled 6 of soil into the box of rocks in order to pack them in tightly two types of rocks were found in the geological samples basalt and breccia three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts armalcolite tranquillityite and pyroxferroite armalcolite was named after armstrong aldrin and collins all have subsequently been found on earth while on the surface armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the lm ladder bearing two drawings of earth of the western and eastern hemispheres an inscription and signatures of the astronauts and president nixon the inscription read at the behest of the nixon administration to add a reference to god nasa included the vague date as a reason to include ad which stands for anno domini in the year of our lord mission control used a coded phrase to warn armstrong his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down he was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk mission control granted the astronauts a 15minute extension in a 2010 interview armstrong explained that nasa limited the first moonwalks time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts plss backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the moon lunar ascent aldrin entered eagle first with some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing 2155 of lunar surface material to the lm hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the lunar equipment conveyor lec this proved to be an inefficient tool and later missions preferred to carry equipment and samples up to the lm by hand armstrong reminded aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket and aldrin tossed the bag down armstrong then jumped onto the ladders third rung and climbed into the lm after transferring to lm life support the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their plss backpacks lunar overshoes an empty hasselblad camera and other equipment the hatch was closed again at 051113 they then pressurized the lm and settled down to sleep presidential speech writer william safire had prepared an in event of moon disaster announcement for nixon to read in the event the apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the moon the remarks were in a memo from safire to nixons white house chief of staff h r haldeman in which safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster according to the plan mission control would close down communications with the lm and a clergyman would commend their souls to the deepest of the deep in a public ritual likened to burial at sea the last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to rupert brookes world war i poem the soldier while moving inside the cabin aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for liftoff from the moon there was a concern this would prevent firing the engine stranding them on the moon the nonconductive tip of a duro felttip pen was sufficient to activate the switch after more than 21 hours on the lunar surface in addition to the scientific instruments the astronauts left behind an apollo 1 mission patch in memory of astronauts roger chaffee gus grissom and edward white who died when their command module caught fire during a test in january 1967 two memorial medals of soviet cosmonauts vladimir komarov and yuri gagarin who died in 1967 and 1968 respectively a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk carrying the goodwill statements by presidents eisenhower kennedy johnson and nixon along with messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world the disk also carries a listing of the leadership of the us congress a listing of members of the four committees of the house and senate responsible for the nasa legislation and the names of nasas past and thencurrent top management after about seven hours of rest the crew was awakened by houston to prepare for the return flight two and a half hours later at 175400 utc they lifted off in eagles ascent stage to rejoin collins aboard columbia in lunar orbit film taken from the lm ascent stage upon liftoff from the moon reveals the american flag planted some 25 from the descent stage whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple the ascent stage of the lm separated  i was concentrating on the computers and neil was studying the attitude indicator but i looked up long enough to see the flag fall over subsequent apollo missions planted their flags farther from the lm columbia in lunar orbit during his day flying solo around the moon collins never felt lonely although it has been said not since adam has any human known such solitude collins felt very much a part of the mission in his autobiography he wrote this venture has been structured for three men and i consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two in the 48 minutes of each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the earth while columbia passed round the far side of the moon the feeling he reported was not fear or loneliness but rather awareness anticipation satisfaction confidence almost exultation one of collins first tasks was to identify the lunar module on the ground to give collins an idea where to look mission control radioed that they believed the lunar module landed about 4 off target each time he passed over the suspected lunar landing site he tried in vain to find the module on his first orbits on the back side of the moon collins performed maintenance activities such as dumping excess water produced by the fuel cells and preparing the cabin for armstrong and aldrin to return just before he reached the dark side on the third orbit mission control informed collins there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant if it became too cold parts of columbia might freeze mission control advised him to assume manual control and implement environmental control system malfunction procedure 17 instead collins flicked the switch on the system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again and carried on with normal housekeeping chores while keeping an eye on the temperature when columbia came back around to the near side of the moon again he was able to report that the problem had been resolved for the next couple of orbits he described his time on the back side of the moon as relaxing after aldrin and armstrong completed their eva collins slept so he could be rested for the rendezvous while the flight plan called for eagle to meet up with columbia collins was prepared for a contingency in which he would fly columbia down to meet eagle return eagle rendezvoused with columbia at 2124 utc on july 21 and the two docked at 2135 eagles ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit at 2341 just before the apollo 12 flight it was noted that eagle was still likely to be orbiting the moon later nasa reports mentioned that eagles orbit had decayed resulting in it impacting in an uncertain location on the lunar surface in 2021 however some calculations show that the lander may still be in orbit on july 23 the last night before splashdown the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which collins commented aldrin added armstrong concluded on the return to earth a bearing at the guam tracking station failed potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the earth return a regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director charles force had his tenyearold son greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease greg was later thanked by armstrong splashdown and quarantine the aircraft carrier hornet under the command of captain carl j seiberlich was selected as the primary recovery ship prs for apollo 11 on june 5 replacing its sister ship the lph princeton which had recovered apollo 10 on may 26 hornet was then at her home port of long beach california on reaching pearl harbor on july 5 hornet embarked the sikorsky sh3 sea king helicopters of hs4 a unit which specialized in recovery of apollo spacecraft specialized divers of udt detachment apollo a 35man nasa recovery team and about 120 media representatives to make room most of hornets air wing was left behind in long beach special recovery equipment was also loaded including a boilerplate command module used for training on july 12 with apollo 11 still on the launch pad hornet departed pearl harbor for the recovery area in the central pacific in the vicinity of 10 a presidential party consisting of nixon borman secretary of state william p rogers and national security advisor henry kissinger flew to johnston atoll on air force one then to the command ship uss arlington in marine one after a night on board they would fly to hornet in marine one for a few hours of ceremonies on arrival aboard hornet the party was greeted by the commanderinchief pacific command cincpac admiral john s mccain jr and nasa administrator thomas o paine who flew to hornet from pago pago in one of hornets carrier onboard delivery aircraft weather satellites were not yet common but us air force captain hank brandli had access to topsecret spy satellite images he realized that a storm front was headed for the apollo recovery area poor visibility which could make locating the capsule difficult and strong upperlevel winds which would have ripped their parachutes to shreds according to brandli posed a serious threat to the safety of the mission brandli alerted navy captain willard s houston jr the commander of the fleet weather center at pearl harbor who had the required security clearance on their recommendation rear admiral donald c davis commander of manned spaceflight recovery forces pacific advised nasa to change the recovery area each man risking his career a new location was selected 215 northeast this altered the flight plan a different sequence of computer programs was used one never before attempted in a conventional entry trajectory event p64 was followed by p67 for a skipout reentry p65 and p66 were employed to handle the exit and entry parts of the skip in this case because they were extending the reentry but not actually skipping out p66 was not invoked and instead p65 led directly to p67 the crew were also warned they would not be in a fulllift headsdown attitude when they entered p67 the first programs acceleration subjected the astronauts to 65 the second to 60 before dawn on july 24 hornet launched four sea king helicopters and three grumman e1 tracers two of the e1s were designated as air boss while the third acted as a communications relay aircraft two of the sea kings carried divers and recovery equipment the third carried photographic equipment and the fourth carried the decontamination swimmer and the flight surgeon at 1644 utc 0544 local time columbias drogue parachutes were deployed this was observed by the helicopters seven minutes later columbia struck the water forcefully 2660 east of wake island 380 south of johnston atoll and 24 from hornet at 13 82 with 6 seas and winds at 17 from the east were reported under broken clouds at 1500 with visibility of 10 at the recovery site reconnaissance aircraft flying to the original splashdown location reported the conditions brandli and houston had predicted during splashdown columbia landed upside down but was righted within ten minutes by flotation bags activated by the astronauts a diver from the navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to prevent it from drifting more divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and positioned rafts for astronaut extraction the divers then passed biological isolation garments bigs to the astronauts and assisted them into the life raft the possibility of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote but nasa took precautions at the recovery site the astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and columbia wiped with povidoneiodine to remove any lunar dust that might be present the astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter bigs were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board hornet the raft containing decontamination materials was intentionally sunk after touchdown on hornet at 1753 utc the helicopter was lowered by the elevator into the hangar bay where the astronauts walked the 30 to the mobile quarantine facility mqf where they would begin the earthbased portion of their 21 days of quarantine this practice would continue for two more apollo missions apollo 12 and apollo 14 before the moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped nixon welcomed the astronauts back to earth he told them as a result of what youve done the world has never been closer together before after nixon departed hornet was brought alongside the 5 columbia which was lifted aboard by the ships crane placed on a dolly and moved next to the mqf it was then attached to the mqf with a flexible tunnel allowing the lunar samples film data tapes and other items to be removed hornet returned to pearl harbor where the mqf was loaded onto a lockheed c141 starlifter and airlifted to the manned spacecraft center the astronauts arrived at the lunar receiving laboratory at 1000 utc on july 28 columbia was taken to ford island for deactivation and its pyrotechnics made safe it was then taken to hickham air force base from whence it was flown to houston in a douglas c133 cargomaster reaching the lunar receiving laboratory on july 30 in accordance with the extraterrestrial exposure law a set of regulations promulgated by nasa on july 16 to codify its quarantine protocol the astronauts continued in quarantine after three weeks in confinement first in the apollo spacecraft then in their trailer on hornet and finally in the lunar receiving laboratory the astronauts were given a clean bill of health on august 10 1969 the interagency committee on back contamination met in atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts on those who had joined them in quarantine nasa physician william carpentier and mqf project engineer john hirasaki and on columbia itself loose equipment from the spacecraft remained in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study celebrations on august 13 the three astronauts rode in tickertape parades in their honor in new york and chicago with an estimated six million attendees on the same evening in los angeles there was an official state dinner to celebrate the flight attended by members of congress 44 governors chief justice of the united states warren e burger and his predecessor earl warren and ambassadors from 83 nations at the century plaza hotel nixon and agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the presidential medal of freedom the three astronauts spoke before a joint session of congress on september 16 1969 they presented two us flags one to the house of representatives and the other to the senate that they had carried with them to the surface of the moon the flag of american samoa on apollo 11 is on display at the jean p haydon museum in pago pago the capital of american samoa this celebration began a 38day world tour that brought the astronauts to 22 countries and included visits with many world leaders the crew toured from september 29 to november 5 the world tour started in mexico city and ended in tokyo stops on the tour in order were mexico city bogota buenos aires rio de janeiro las palmas in the canary islands madrid paris amsterdam brussels oslo cologne berlin london rome belgrade ankara kinshasa tehran mumbai dhaka bangkok darwin sydney guam seoul tokyo and honolulu many nations honored the first human moon landing with special features in magazines or by issuing apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins legacy cultural significance humans walking on the moon and returning safely to earth accomplished kennedys goal set eight years earlier in mission control during the apollo 11 landing kennedys speech flashed on the screen followed by the words task accomplished july 1969 the success of apollo 11 demonstrated the united states technological superiority and with the success of apollo 11 america had won the space race new phrases permeated into the english language if they can send a man to the moon why cant they  became a common saying following apollo 11 armstrongs words on the lunar surface also spun off various parodies while most people celebrated the accomplishment disenfranchised americans saw it as a symbol of the divide in america evidenced by protesters led by ralph abernathy outside of kennedy space center the day before apollo 11 launched nasa administrator thomas paine met with abernathy at the occasion both hoping that the space program can spur progress also in other regards such as poverty in the us paine was then asked and agreed to host protesters as spectators at the launch and abernathy awestruck by the spectacle prayed for the astronauts racial and financial inequalities frustrated citizens who wondered why money spent on the apollo program was not spent taking care of humans on earth a poem by gil scottheron called whitey on the moon 1970 illustrated the racial inequality in the united states that was highlighted by the space race the poem starts with twenty percent of the worlds population watched humans walk on the moon for the first time while apollo 11 sparked the interest of the world the followon apollo missions did not hold the interest of the nation one possible explanation was the shift in complexity landing someone on the moon was an easy goal to understand lunar geology was too abstract for the average person another is that kennedys goal of landing humans on the moon had already been accomplished a welldefined objective helped project apollo accomplish its goal but after it was completed it was hard to justify continuing the lunar missions while most americans were proud of their nations achievements in space exploration only once during the late 1960s did the gallup poll indicate that a majority of americans favored doing more in space as opposed to doing less by 1973 59 percent of those polled favored cutting spending on space exploration the space race had been won and cold war tensions were easing as the us and soviet union entered the era of détente this was also a time when inflation was rising which put pressure on the government to reduce spending what saved the space program was that it was one of the few government programs that had achieved something great drastic cuts warned caspar weinberger the deputy director of the office of management and budget might send a signal that our best years are behind us after the apollo 11 mission officials from the soviet union said landing humans on the moon was dangerous and unnecessary at the time the soviet union was attempting to retrieve lunar samples robotically the soviets publicly denied there was a race to the moon and indicated they were not making an attempt mstislav keldysh said in july 1969 we are concentrating wholly on the creation of large satellite systems it was revealed in 1989 that the soviets had tried to send people to the moon but were unable due to technological difficulties the publics reaction in the soviet union was mixed the soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing which affected the reaction a portion of the populace did not give it any attention and another portion was angered by it the apollo 11 landing is referenced in the songs armstrong aldrin and collins by the byrds on the 1969 album ballad of easy rider and coon on the moon by howlin wolf on the 1973 album the back door wolf spacecraft the command module columbia went on a tour of the united states visiting 49 state capitals the district of columbia and anchorage alaska in 1971 it was transferred to the smithsonian institution and was displayed at the national air and space museum nasm in washington dc it was in the central milestones of flight exhibition hall in front of the jefferson drive entrance sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the wright flyer spirit of st louis bell x1 north american x15 and friendship 7 columbia was moved in 2017 to the nasm mary baker engen restoration hangar at the steven f udvarhazy center in chantilly virginia to be readied for a fourcity tour titled destination moon the apollo 11 mission this included space center houston from october 14 2017 to march 18 2018 the saint louis science center from april 14 to september 3 2018 the senator john heinz history center in pittsburgh from september 29 2018 to february 18 2019 and its last location at museum of flight in seattle from march 16 to september 2 2019 continued renovations at the smithsonian allowed time for an additional stop for the capsule and it was moved to the cincinnati museum center the ribbon cutting ceremony was on september 29 2019 for 40 years armstrongs and aldrins space suits were displayed in the museums apollo to the moon exhibit until it permanently closed on december 3 2018 to be replaced by a new gallery which was scheduled to open in 2022 a special display of armstrongs suit was unveiled for the 50th anniversary of apollo 11 in july 2019 the quarantine trailer the flotation collar and the flotation bags are in the smithsonians steven f udvarhazy center annex near washington dulles international airport in chantilly virginia where they are on display along with a test lunar module the descent stage of the lm eagle remains on the moon in 2009 the lunar reconnaissance orbiter lro imaged the various apollo landing sites on the surface of the moon for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules scientific instruments and foot trails made by the astronauts the remains of the ascent stage are assumed to lie at an unknown location on the lunar surface the ascent stage eagle was not tracked after it was jettisoned the lunar gravity field is sufficiently nonuniform to make low moon orbits unstable after a short time leading the orbiting object to impact the surface however using a program developed by nasa and highresolution lunar gravity data a paper was published in 2021 indicating that eagle might still be in orbit as late as 2020 using the orbital elements published by nasa a monte carlo method was used to generate parameter sets that bracket the uncertainties in these elements all simulations of the orbit predicted that eagle would never impact the lunar surface in march 2012 a team of specialists financed by amazon founder jeff bezos located the f1 engines from the sic stage that launched apollo 11 into space they were found on the atlantic seabed using advanced sonar scanning his team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface in july 2013 a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one of the engines raised from the atlantic which nasa confirmed was from apollo 11 the sivb third stage which performed apollo 11s translunar injection remains in a solar orbit near to that of earth moon rocks the main repository for the apollo moon rocks is the lunar sample laboratory facility at the lyndon b johnson space center in houston texas for safekeeping there is also a smaller collection stored at white sands test facility near las cruces new mexico most of the rocks are stored in nitrogen to keep them free of moisture they are handled only indirectly using special tools over 100 research laboratories worldwide conduct studies of the samples approximately 500 samples are prepared and sent to investigators every year in november 1969 nixon asked nasa to make up about 250 presentation apollo 11 lunar sample displays for 135 nations the fifty states of the united states and its possessions and the united nations each display included moon dust from apollo 11 and flags including one of the soviet union taken along by apollo 11 the ricesized particles were four small pieces of moon soil weighing about 50 mg and were enveloped in a clear acrylic button about as big as a united states half dollar coin this acrylic button magnified the grains of lunar dust nixon gave the apollo 11 lunar sample displays as goodwill gifts in 1970 experiment results the passive seismic experiment ran until the command uplink failed on august 25 1969 the downlink failed on december 14 1969 2018 the lunar laser ranging experiment remains operational armstrongs camera armstrongs hasselblad camera was thought to be lost or left on the moon surface lm memorabilia in 2015 after armstrong died in 2012 his widow contacted the national air and space museum to inform them she had found a white cloth bag in one of armstrongs closets the bag contained various items which should have been left behind in the lunar module including the 16mm data acquisition camera that had been used to capture images of the first moon landing the camera is currently on display at the national air and space museum anniversary events 40th anniversary on july 15 2009 lifecom released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by life photographer ralph morse prior to the apollo 11 launch from july 16 to 24 2009 nasa streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred it is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments in july 2010 airtoground voice recordings and film footage shot in mission control during the apollo 11 powered descent and landing was resynchronized and released for the first time the john f kennedy presidential library and museum set up an adobe flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of apollo 11 from launch to landing on the moon on july 20 2009 armstrong aldrin and collins met with us president barack obama at the white house we expect that there is as we speak another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next armstrong collins and aldrin obama said we want to make sure that nasa is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey on august 7 2009 an act of congress awarded the three astronauts a congressional gold medal the highest civilian award in the united states the bill was sponsored by florida senator bill nelson and florida representative alan grayson a group of british scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the moon landing 50th anniversary on june 10 2015 congressman bill posey introduced resolution hr 2726 to the 114th session of the united states house of representatives directing the united states mint to design and sell commemorative coins in gold silver and clad for the 50th anniversary of the apollo 11 mission on january 24 2019 the mint released the apollo 11 fiftieth anniversary commemorative coins to the public on its website a documentary film apollo 11 with restored footage of the 1969 event premiered in imax on march 1 2019 and broadly in theaters on march 8 the smithsonian institutes national air and space museum and nasa sponsored the apollo 50 festival on the national mall in washington dc the three day july 18 to 20 2019 outdoor festival featured handson exhibits and activities live performances and speakers such as adam savage and nasa scientists as part of the festival a projection of the 363 tall saturn v rocket was displayed on the east face of the 555 tall washington monument from july 16 through the 20th from 930 pm until 1130 pm edt the program also included a 17minute show that combined fullmotion video projected on the washington monument to recreate the assembly and launch of the saturn v rocket the projection was joined by a 40 wide recreation of the kennedy space center countdown clock and two large video screens showing archival footage to recreate the time leading up to the moon landing there were three shows per night on july 1920 with the last show on saturday delayed slightly so the portion where armstrong first set foot on the moon would happen exactly 50 years to the second after the actual event on july 19 2019 the google doodle

crewed missions to the moon spacecraft launched in 1968 1968 in the united states spacecraft which reentered in 1968 december 1968 events spacecraft launched by saturn rockets jim lovell william anders frank borman apollo 8 december 2127 1968 was the first crewed spacecraft to leave low earth orbit and the first human spaceflight to reach the moon the crew orbited the moon ten times without landing and then departed safely back to earth these three astronautsfrank borman james lovell and william anderswere the first humans to witness and photograph the far side of the moon and an earthrise apollo 8 launched on december 21 1968 and was the second crewed spaceflight mission flown in the united states apollo space program after apollonbsp7 which stayed in earth orbit apollonbsp8 was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the saturn v rocket and was the first human spaceflight from the kennedy space center located adjacent to cape kennedy air force station in florida originally planned as the second crewed apollo lunar module and command module test to be flown in an elliptical medium earth orbit in early 1969 the mission profile was changed in august 1968 to a more ambitious commandmoduleonly lunar orbital flight to be flown in december as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight astronaut jim mcdivitts crew who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low earth orbit became the crew for the apollonbsp9 mission and bormans crew were moved to the apollonbsp8 mission this left bormans crew with two to three months less training and preparation time than originally planned and replaced the planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training apollo 8 took 68 hours to travel the distance to the moon the crew orbited the moon ten times over the course of twenty hours during which they made a christmas eve television broadcast in which they read the first ten verses from the book of genesis at the time the broadcast was the most watched tv program ever apollonbsp8s successful mission paved the way for apollo 10 and with apollonbsp11 in july 1969 the fulfillment of us president john f kennedys goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the decade the apollonbsp8 astronauts returned to earth on december 27 1968 when their spacecraft splashed down in the northern pacific ocean the crew members were named time magazines men of the year for 1968 upon their return background in the late 1950s and early 1960s the united states was engaged in the cold war a geopolitical rivalry with the soviet union on october 4 1957 the soviet union launched sputnik 1 the first artificial satellite this unexpected success stoked fears and imaginations around the world it not only demonstrated that the soviet union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances it challenged american claims of military economic and technological superiority the launch precipitated the sputnik crisis and triggered the space race president john f kennedy believed that not only was it in the national interest of the united states to be superior to other nations but that the perception of american power was at least as important as the actuality it was therefore intolerable to him for the soviet union to be more advanced in the field of space exploration he was determined that the united states should compete and sought a challenge that maximized its chances of winning the soviet union had heavierlifting carrier rockets which meant kennedy needed to choose a goal that was beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry one where the us and soviet union would be starting from a position of equalitysomething spectacular even if it could not be justified on military economic or scientific grounds after consulting with his experts and advisors he chose such a project to land a man on the moon and return him to the earth this project already had a name project apollo an early and crucial decision was the adoption of lunar orbit rendezvous under which a specialized spacecraft would land on the lunar surface the apollo spacecraft therefore had three primary components a command module cm with a cabin for the three astronauts and the only part that would return to earth a service module sm to provide the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and water and a twostage lunar module lm which comprised a descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to return the astronauts to lunar orbit this configuration could be launched by the saturn v rocket that was then under development framework prime crew the initial crew assignment of frank borman as commander michael collins as command module pilot cmp and william anders as lunar module pilot lmp for the third crewed apollo flight was officially announced on november 20 1967 collins was replaced by jim lovell in july 1968 after suffering a cervical disc herniation that required surgery to repair this crew was unique among prespace shuttle era missions in that the commander was not the most experienced member of the crew lovell had flown twice before on gemini vii and gemini xii this would also be the first case of a commander of a previous mission lovell gemini xii flying as a noncommander this was also the first mission to reunite crewmates from a previous mission lovell and borman gemini vii february 2024 two of the three apollo 8 astronauts remain alive frank borman died on november 7 2023 backup crew the backup crew assignment of neil armstrong as commander lovell as cmp and buzz aldrin as lmp for the third crewed apollo flight was officially announced at the same time as the prime crew when lovell was reassigned to the prime crew aldrin was moved to cmp and fred haise was brought in as backup lmp armstrong would later command apollonbsp11 with aldrin as lmp and collins as cmp haise served on the backup crew of apollonbsp11 as lmp and flew on apollonbsp13 as lmp support personnel during projects mercury and gemini each mission had a prime and a backup crew for apollo a third crew of astronauts was added known as the support crew the support crew maintained the flight plan checklists and mission ground rules and ensured that the prime and backup crews were apprised of any changes the support crew developed procedures in the simulators especially those for emergency situations so that the prime and backup crews could practice and master them in their simulator training for apollonbsp8 the support crew consisted of ken mattingly vance brand and gerald carr the capsule communicator capcom was an astronaut at the mission control center in houston texas who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew for apollonbsp8 the capcoms were michael collins gerald carr ken mattingly neil armstrong buzz aldrin vance brand and fred haise the mission control teams rotated in three shifts each led by a flight director the directors for apollonbsp8 were clifford e charlesworth green team glynn lunney black team and milton windler maroon team mission insignia and callsign the triangular shape of the insignia refers to the shape of the apollo cm it shows a red figurenbsp8 looping around the earth and moon to reflect both the mission number and the circumlunar nature of the mission on the bottom of thenbsp8 are the names of the three astronauts the initial design of the insignia was developed by jim lovell who reportedly sketched it while riding in the back seat of a t38 flight from california to houston shortly after learning of apollonbsp8s redesignation as a lunarorbital mission the crew wanted to name their spacecraft but nasa did not allow it the crew would have likely chosen columbiad the name of the giant cannon that launches a space vehicle in jules vernes 1865 novel from the earth to the moon the apollonbsp11 cm was named columbia in part for that reason preparations mission schedule on september 20 1967 nasa adopted a sevenstep plan for apollo missions with the final step being a moon landing apollonbsp4 and apollonbsp6 were a missions tests of the saturnnbspv launch vehicle using an uncrewed block i production model of the command and service module csm in earth orbit apollonbsp5 was a b mission a test of the lm in earth orbit apollonbsp7 scheduled for october 1968 would be a c mission a crewed earthorbit flight of the csm further missions depended on the readiness of the lm it had been decided as early as may 1967 that there would be at least four additional missions apollonbsp8 was planned as the d mission a test of the lm in a low earth orbit in december 1968 by james mcdivitt david scott and russell schweickart while bormans crew would fly the e mission a more rigorous lm test in an elliptical medium earth orbit as apollonbsp9 in early 1969 the f mission would test the csm and lm in lunar orbit and the g mission would be the finale the moon landing production of the lm fell behind schedule and when apollonbsp8s lm3 arrived at the kennedy space center ksc in june 1968 more than a hundred significant defects were discovered leading bob gilruth the director of the manned spacecraft center msc and others to conclude that there was no prospect of lm3 being ready to fly in 1968 indeed it was possible that delivery would slip to february or march 1969 following the original sevenstep plan would have meant delaying the d and subsequent missions and endangering the programs goal of a lunar landing before the end of 1969 george low the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office proposed a solution in august 1968 to keep the program on track despite the lm delay since the next csm designated as csm103 would be ready three months before lm3 a csmonly mission could be flown in december 1968 instead of repeating the c mission flight of apollonbsp7 this csm could be sent all the way to the moon with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit and returning to earth the new mission would also allow nasa to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have had to wait until apollonbsp10 the scheduled f mission this also meant that the medium earth orbit e mission could be dispensed with the net result was that only the d mission had to be delayed and the plan for lunar landing in mid1969 could remain on timeline on august 9 1968 low discussed the idea with gilruth flight director chris kraft and the director of flight crew operations donald slayton they then flew to the marshall space flight center msfc in huntsville alabama where they met with ksc director kurt debus apollo program director samuel c phillips rocco petrone and wernher von braun kraft considered the proposal feasible from a flight control standpoint debus and petrone agreed that the next saturn v as503 could be made ready by december 1 and von braun was confident the pogo oscillation problems that had afflicted apollonbsp6 had been fixed almost every senior manager at nasa agreed with this new mission citing confidence in both the hardware and the personnel along with the potential for a circumlunar flight providing a significant morale boost the only person who needed some convincing was james e webb the nasa administrator backed by the full support of his agency webb authorized the mission apollonbsp8 was officially changed from a d mission to a cprime lunarorbit mission with the change in mission for apollo 8 slayton asked mcdivitt if he still wanted to fly it mcdivitt turned it down his crew had spent a great deal of time preparing to test the lm and that was what he still wanted to do slayton then decided to swap the prime and backup crews of the dnbspand enbspmissions this swap also meant a swap of spacecraft requiring bormans crew to use csm103 while mcdivitts crew would use csm104 since cm104 could not be made ready by december david scott was not happy about giving up cm103 the testing of which he had closely supervised for cm104 although the two were almost identical and anders was less than enthusiastic about being an lmp on a flight with no lm instead apollonbsp8 would carry the lm test article a boilerplate model that would simulate the correct weight and balance of lm3 added pressure on the apollo program to make its 1969 landing goal was provided by the soviet unions zondnbsp5 mission which flew some living creatures including russian tortoises in a cislunar loop around the moon and returned them to earth on september 21 there was speculation within nasa and the press that they might be preparing to launch cosmonauts on a similar circumlunar mission before the end of 1968 compounding these concerns american reconnaissance satellites observed a mockup n1 being rolled to the pad at baikonur on november 25 1967 the apollo 8 crew now living in the crew quarters at kennedy space center received a visit from charles lindbergh and his wife anne morrow lindbergh the night before the launch they talked about how before his 1927 flight lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from new york city to paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight the total he had carried was a tenth of the amount that the saturn v would burn every second the next day the lindberghs watched the launch of apollonbsp8 from a nearby dune saturn v redesign the saturn v rocket used by apollonbsp8 was designated as503 or the 03rd model of the saturnnbspv 5 rocket to be used in the apollosaturn as program when it was erected in the vehicle assembly building on december 20 1967 it was thought that the rocket would be used for an uncrewed earthorbit test flight carrying a boilerplate command and service module apollonbsp6 had suffered several major problems during its april 1968 flight including severe pogo oscillation during its first stage two secondstage engine failures and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit without assurances that these problems had been rectified nasa administrators could not justify risking a crewed mission until additional uncrewed test flights proved the saturn v was ready teams from the msfc went to work on the problems of primary concern was the pogo oscillation which would not only hamper engine performance but could exert significant gforces on a crew a task force of contractors nasa agency representatives and msfc researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket a system that used helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed of equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two when an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two it had accidentally shut down engine threes liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection as a result engine three failed within one second of engine twos shutdown further investigation revealed the same problem for the thirdstage enginea faulty igniter line the team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches the teams tested their solutions in august 1968 at the msfc a saturn stage ic was equipped with shockabsorbing devices to demonstrate the teams solution to the problem of pogo oscillation while a saturn stage ii was retrofitted with modified fuel lines to demonstrate their resistance to leaks and ruptures in vacuum conditions once nasa administrators were convinced that the problems had been solved they gave their approval for a crewed mission using as503 the apollo 8 spacecraft was placed on top of the rocket on september 21 and the rocket made the slow 3 journey to the launch pad atop one of nasas two massive crawlertransporters on octobernbsp9 testing continued all through december until the day before launch including various levels of readiness testing from decembernbsp5 through 11 final testing of modifications to address the problems of pogo oscillation ruptured fuel lines and bad igniter lines took place on december 18 three days before the scheduled launch mission parameter summary as the first crewed spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body apollonbsp8s profile had two different sets of orbital parameters separated by a translunar injection maneuver apollo lunar missions would begin with a nominal 100 circular earth parking orbit apollonbsp8 was launched into an initial orbit with an apogee of 9999 and a perigee of 9957 with an inclination of 3251 to the equator and an orbital period of 8819 minutes propellant venting increased the apogee by 64 over the 2nbsphours 44 minutes and 30 seconds spent in the parking orbit this was followed by a translunar injection tli burn of the sivb third stage for 318 seconds accelerating the 63650 command and service module and 19900 lm test article from an orbital velocity of 25567 to the injection velocity of 35505 which set a record for the highest speed relative to earth that humans had ever traveled this speed was slightly less than the earths escape velocity of 36747 but put apollonbsp8 into an elongated elliptical earth orbit close enough to the moon to be captured by the moons gravity the standard lunar orbit for apollo missions was planned as a nominal 60 circular orbit above the moons surface initial lunar orbit insertion was an ellipse with a perilune of 600 and an apolune of 1685 at an inclination of 12 from the lunar equator this was then circularized at 607 with an orbital period of 1287 minutes the effect of lunar mass concentrations mascons on the orbit was found to be greater than initially predicted over the course of the ten lunar orbits lasting twenty hours the orbital distance was perturbated to 636 apollo 8 achieved a maximum distance from earth of 203752 launch and translunar injection apollo 8 was launched at 125100 utc 075100 eastern standard time on december 21 1968 using the saturn vs three stages to achieve earth orbit the sic first stage landed in the atlantic ocean at 30 and the sii second stage landed at 31 the sivb third stage injected the craft into earth orbit and remained attached to perform the tli burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the moon once the vehicle reached earth orbit both the crew and houston flight controllers spent the next 2nbsphours and 38 minutes checking that the spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for tli the proper operation of the sivb third stage of the rocket was crucial and in the last uncrewed test it had failed to reignite for this burn collins was the first capcom on duty and at 2nbsphours 27 minutes and 22 seconds after launch he radioed apollonbsp8 you are go for tli this communication meant that mission control had given official permission for apollonbsp8 to go to the moon the sivb engine ignited on time and performed the tli burn perfectly over the next five minutes the spacecrafts speed increased from 7600 after the sivb had placed the mission on course for the moon the command and service modules csm the remaining apollonbsp8 spacecraft separated from it the crew then rotated the spacecraft to take photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it as the crew rotated the spacecraft they had their first views of the earth as they moved away from itthis marked the first time humans had viewed the whole earth at once borman became worried that the sivb was staying too close to the csm and suggested to mission control that the crew perform a separation maneuver mission control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards earth and using the small reaction control system rcs thrusters on the service module sm to add 11 to their velocity away from the earth but borman did not want to lose sight of the sivb after discussion the crew and mission control decided to burn in the earth direction to increase speed but at 77 instead the time needed to prepare and perform the additional burn put the crew an hour behind their onboard tasks five hours after launch mission control sent a command to the sivb to vent its remaining fuel changing its trajectory the sivb with the test article attached posed no further hazard to apollonbsp8 passing the orbit of the moon and going into a 099 solar orbit with an inclination of 2347 from the earths equatorial plane and an orbital period of 34080 days it became a derelict object and will continue to orbit the sun for many years if not retrieved the apollo 8 crew were the first humans to pass through the van allen radiation belts which extend up to 15000 from earth scientists predicted that passing through the belts quickly at the spacecrafts high speed would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest xray or 1nbspmilligray mgy during a year the average human receives a dose of 2nbspto 3nbspmgy from background radiation to record the actual radiation dosages each crew member wore a personal radiation dosimeter that transmitted data to earth as well as three passive film dosimeters that showed the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew by the end of the mission the crew members experienced an average radiation dose of 16 mgy lunar trajectory lovells main job as command module pilot was as navigator although mission control normally performed all the actual navigation calculations it was necessary to have a crew member adept at navigation so that the crew could return to earth in case communication with mission control was lost lovell navigated by star sightings using a sextant built into the spacecraft measuring the angle between a star and the earths or the moons horizon this task was made difficult by a large cloud of debris around the spacecraft which made it hard to distinguish the stars by seven hours into the mission the crew was about 1nbsphour and 40 minutes behind flight plan because of the problems in moving away from the sivb and lovells obscured star sightings the crew placed the spacecraft into passive thermal control ptc also called barbecue roll in which the spacecraft rotated about once per hour around its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft in direct sunlight parts of the spacecrafts outer surface could be heated to over 200 while the parts in shadow would be 100 these temperatures could cause the heat shield to crack and propellant lines to burst because it was impossible to get a perfect roll the spacecraft swept out a cone as it rotated the crew had to make minor adjustments every half hour as the cone pattern got larger and larger the first midcourse correction came eleven hours into the flight the crew had been awake for more than 16 hours before launch nasa had decided at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with problems that might arise borman started the first sleep shift but found sleeping difficult because of the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises testing on the ground had shown that the service propulsion system sps engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its combustion chamber was coated first by burning the engine for a short period this first correction burn was only 24 seconds and added about 204 velocity prograde in the direction of travel this change was less than the planned 248 because of a bubble of helium in the oxidizer lines which caused unexpectedly low propellant pressure the crew had to use the small rcs thrusters to make up the shortfall two later planned midcourse corrections were canceled because the apollonbsp8 trajectory was found to be perfect about an hour after starting his sleep shift borman obtained permission from ground control to take a seconal sleeping pill the pill had little effect borman eventually fell asleep and then awoke feeling ill he vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea this left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces which the crew cleaned up as well as they could borman initially did not want everyone to know about his medical problems but lovell and anders wanted to inform mission control the crew decided to use the data storage equipment dse which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to mission control at high speed after recording a description of bormans illness they asked mission control to check the recording stating that they would like an evaluation of the voice comments the apollo 8 crew and mission control medical personnel held a conference using an unoccupied secondfloor control room there were two identical control rooms in houston on the second and third floors only one of which was used during a mission the conference participants concluded that there was little to worry about and that bormans illness was either a 24hour flu as borman thought or a reaction to the sleeping pill researchers now believe that he was suffering from space adaptation syndrome which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their vestibular system adapts to weightlessness space adaptation syndrome had not occurred on previous spacecraft mercury and gemini because those astronauts could not move freely in the small cabins of those spacecraft the increased cabin space in the apollo command module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement contributing to symptoms of space sickness for borman and later astronaut rusty schweickart during apollonbsp9 the cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight except for the crews checking that the spacecraft was in working order and that they were on course during this time nasa scheduled a television broadcast at 31 hours after launch the apollonbsp8 crew used a 2 camera that broadcast in blackandwhite only using a vidicon tube the camera had two lenses a very wideangle 160 lens and a telephoto 9 lens during this first broadcast the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the earth appeared from space however difficulties aiming the narrowangle lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the earth impossible additionally without proper filters the earth image became saturated by any bright source in the end all the crew could show the people watching back on earth was a bright blob after broadcasting for 17 minutes the rotation of the spacecraft took the highgain antenna out of view of the receiving stations on earth and they ended the transmission with lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday by this time the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts lovell went to sleep 32 hours into the flight  threeandahalf hours before he had planned to a short while later anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill the crew was unable to see the moon for much of the outward cruise two factors made the moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft three of the five windows fogging up due to outgassed oils from the silicone sealant and the attitude required for passive thermal control it was not until the crew had gone behind the moon that they would be able to see it for the first time apollo 8 made a second television broadcast at 55 hours into the flight this time the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the earth through the telephoto lens although difficult to aim as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft the crew was able to broadcast back to earth the first television pictures of the earth the crew spent the transmission describing the earth what was visible and the colors they could see the transmission lasted 23 minutes lunar sphere of influence at about 55 hours and 40 minutes into the flight and 13 hours before entering lunar orbit the crew of apollonbsp8 became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body in other words the effect of the moons gravitational force on apollonbsp8 became stronger than that of the earth at the time it happened apollonbsp8 was 38759 from the moon and had a speed of 3990 relative to the moon this historic moment was of little interest to the crew since they were still calculating their trajectory with respect to the launch pad at kennedy space center they would continue to do so until they performed their last midcourse correction switching to a reference frame based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit the last major event before lunar orbit insertion loi was a second midcourse correction it was in retrograde against the direction of travel and slowed the spacecraft down by 20 effectively reducing the closest distance at which the spacecraft would pass the moon at exactly 61 hours after launch about 24200 from the moon the crew burned the rcs for 11 seconds they would now pass 717 from the lunar surface at 64 hours into the flight the crew began to prepare for lunar orbit insertionnbsp1 loi1 this maneuver had to be performed perfectly and due to orbital mechanics had to be on the far side of the moon out of contact with the earth after mission control was polled for a gono go decision the crew was told at 68 hours that they were go and riding the best bird we can find lovell replied well see you on the other side and for the first time in history humans travelled behind the moon and out of radio contact with the earth with ten minutes remaining before loi1 the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in its correct position at that time they finally got their first glimpses of the moon they had been flying over the unlit side and it was lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight obliquely illuminating the lunar surface the loi burn was only two minutes away so the crew had little time to appreciate the view lunar orbit the sps was ignited at 69 hours 8nbspminutes and 16 seconds after launch and burned for 4nbspminutes and 7nbspseconds placing the apollonbsp8 spacecraft in orbit around the moon the crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives if the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly elliptical lunar orbit or even been flung off into space if it had lasted too long they could have struck the moon after making sure the spacecraft was working they finally had a chance to look at the moon which they would orbit for the next 20 hours on earth mission control continued to wait if the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time the crew would have appeared early from behind the moon exactly at the calculated moment the signal was received from the spacecraft indicating it was in a 1933 orbit around the moon after reporting on the status of the spacecraft lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like lovell continued to describe the terrain they were passing over one of the crews major tasks was reconnaissance of planned future landing sites on the moon especially one in mare tranquillitatis that was planned as the apollonbsp11 landing site the launch time of apollonbsp8 had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site a film camera had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record one frame per second of the moon below bill anders spent much of the next 20 hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest by the end of the mission the crew had taken over eight hundred 70 mm still photographs and 700 of 16 mm movie film throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with earth borman kept asking how the data for the sps looked he wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the earth if necessary he also asked that they receive a gono go decision before they passed behind the moon on each orbit as they reappeared for their second pass in front of the moon the crew set up equipment to broadcast a view of the lunar surface anders described the craters that they were passing over at the end of this second orbit they performed an 11second loi2 burn of the sps to circularize the orbit to 700 throughout the next two orbits the crew continued to check the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the moon during the third pass borman read a small prayer for his church he had been scheduled to participate in a service at st christophers episcopal church near seabrook texas but due to the apollonbsp8 flight he was unable to attend a fellow parishioner and engineer at mission control rod rose suggested that borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service earthrise and genesis broadcast when the spacecraft came out from behind the moon for its fourth pass across the front the crew witnessed an earthrise in person for the first time in human history nasas lunar orbiter 1 had taken the first picture of an earthrise from the vicinity of the moon on august 23 1966 anders saw the earth emerging from behind the lunar horizon and called in excitement to the others taking a blackandwhite photograph as he did so anders asked lovell for color film and then took earthrise a now famous color photo later picked by life magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century due to the synchronous rotation of the moon about the earth earthrise is not generally visible from the lunar surface this is because as seen from any one place on the moons surface earth remains in approximately the same position in the lunar sky either above or below the horizon earthrise is generally visible only while orbiting the moon and at selected surface locations near the moons limb where libration carries the earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon anders continued to take photographs while lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so that borman could rest despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft borman was able to sleep for two orbits awakening periodically to ask questions about their status borman awoke fully when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes they were beginning to not understand questions and had to ask for the answers to be repeated borman realized that everyone was extremely tired from not having a good nights sleep in over three days he ordered anders and lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the moon be scrubbed anders initially protested saying that he was fine but borman would not be swayed anders finally agreed under the condition that borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic pictures of the moon borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted the crew to be alert for the next two orbits anders and lovell slept while borman sat at the helm as they rounded the moon for the ninth time the astronauts began the second television transmission borman introduced the crew followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the moon borman described it as being a vast lonely forbidding expanse of nothing then after talking about what they were flying over anders said that the crew had a message for all those on earth each man on board read a section from the biblical creation story from the book of genesis borman finished the broadcast by wishing a merry christmas to everyone on earth his message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit borman said and from the crew of apollonbsp8 we close with good night good luck a merry christmas and god bless all of youall of you on the good earth the only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the transearth injection tei which was scheduled for 2 hours after the end of the television transmission the tei was the most critical burn of the flight as any failure of the sps to ignite would strand the crew in lunar orbit with little hope of escape as with the previous burn the crew had to perform the maneuver above the far side of the moon out of contact with earth the burn occurred exactly on time the spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it reemerged from behind the moon at 89 hours 28 minutes and 39 seconds the exact time calculated when voice contact was regained lovell announced please be informed there is a santa claus to which ken mattingly the current capcom replied thats affirmative you are the best ones to know the spacecraft began its journey back to earth on december 25 christmas day unplanned manual realignment later lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard he accidentally erased some of the computers memory which caused the inertial measurement unit imu to contain data indicating that the module was in the same relative orientation it had been in before liftoff the imu then fired the thrusters to correct the modules attitude once the crew realized why the computer had changed the modules attitude they realized that they would have to reenter data to tell the computer the modules actual orientation it took lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers using the thrusters to get the stars rigel and sirius aligned and another 15 minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer sixteen months later during the apollonbsp13 mission lovell would have to perform a similar manual realignment under more critical conditions after the modules imu had to be turned off to conserve energy cruise back to earth and reentry the cruise back to earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft as long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly the spacecraft would reenter earths atmosphere twoandahalf days after tei and splash down in the pacific on christmas afternoon the crew made their fifth television broadcast this time they gave a tour of the spacecraft showing how an astronaut lived in space when they finished broadcasting they found a small present from slayton in the food locker a real turkey dinner with stuffing in the same kind of pack given to the troops in vietnam another slayton surprise was a gift of three miniature bottles of brandy which borman ordered the crew to leave alone until after they landed they remained unopened even years after the flight there were also small presents to the crew from their wives the next day at about 124 hours into the mission the sixth and final tv transmission showed the missions best video images of the earth during a fourminute broadcast after two uneventful days the crew prepared for reentry the computer would control the reentry and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude with the blunt end forward in the event of computer failure borman was ready to take over separation from the service module prepared the command module for reentry by exposing the heat shield and shedding unneeded mass the service module would burn up in the atmosphere as planned six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere the crew saw the moon rising above the earths horizon just as had been calculated by the trajectory specialists as the module hit the thin outer atmosphere the crew noticed that it was becoming hazy outside as glowing plasma formed around the spacecraft the spacecraft started slowing down and the deceleration peaked at 6 with the computer controlling the descent by changing the attitude of the spacecraft apollonbsp8 rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to the ocean at 30000 the drogue parachute deployed stabilizing the spacecraft followed at 10000 by the three main parachutes the spacecraft splashdown position was officially reported as 8 in the north pacific ocean southwest of hawaii at 155142 utc on december 27 1968 when the spacecraft hit the water the parachutes dragged it over and left it upside down in what was termed stablenbsp2 position as they were buffeted by a 10 swell borman vomited waiting for the three flotation balloons to right the spacecraft about six minutes after splashdown the command module was righted into a normal apexup stable 1 orientation by its inflatable bag uprighting system the first frogman from aircraft carrier yorktown arrived 43 minutes after splashdown fortyfive minutes later the crew was safe on the flight deck of the yorktown legacy historical importance apollo 8 came at the end of 1968 a year that had seen much upheaval in the united states and most of the world even though the year saw political assassinations political unrest in the streets of europe and america and the prague spring time magazine chose the crew of apollonbsp8 as its men of the year for 1968 recognizing them as the people who most influenced events in the preceding year they had been the first people ever to leave the gravitational influence of the earth and orbit another celestial body they had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as having only a fiftyfifty chance of fully succeeding the effect of apollonbsp8 was summed up in a telegram from a stranger received by borman after the mission that stated simply thank you apollonbsp8 you saved 1968 one of the most famous aspects of the flight was the earthrise picture that the crew took as they came around for their fourth orbit of the moon this was the first time that humans had taken such a picture while actually behind the camera and it has been credited as one of the inspirations of the first earth day in 1970 it was selected as the first of life magazines 100 photographs that changed the world apollo 11 astronaut michael collins said eights momentous historic significance was foremost while space historian robert k poole saw apollonbsp8 as the most historically significant of all the apollo missions the mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first american orbital flight mercuryatlas 6 by john glenn in 1962 there were 1200 journalists covering the mission with the bbcs coverage broadcast in 54 countries in 15 different languages the soviet newspaper pravda featured a quote from boris nikolaevich petrov scientist chairman of the soviet interkosmos program who described the flight as an outstanding achievement of american space sciences and technology it is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saweither live or delayedthe christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon the apollonbsp8 broadcasts won an emmy award the highest honor given by the academy of television arts  sciences madalyn murray ohair an atheist later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against nasa over the reading from genesis ohair wanted the courts to ban american astronautswho were all government employeesfrom public prayer in space though the case was rejected by the supreme court of the united states apparently for lack of jurisdiction in outer space it caused nasa to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the apollo program buzz aldrin on apollonbsp11 selfcommunicated presbyterian communion on the surface of the moon after landing he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years and referred to it only obliquely at the time in 1969 the united states post office department issued a postage stamp scott catalogue 1371 commemorating the apollonbsp8 flight around the moon the stamp featured a detail of the famous photograph of the earthrise over the moon taken by anders on christmas eve and the words in the beginning godnbsp the first words of the book of genesis in january 1969 just 18 days after the crews return to earth they appeared in the super bowl iii pregame show reciting the pledge of allegiance before the national anthem was performed by trumpeter lloyd geisler of the washington national symphony orchestra spacecraft location in january 1970 the spacecraft was delivered to osaka japan for display in the us pavilion at expo 70 it is now displayed at the chicago museum of science and industry along with a collection of personal items from the flight donated by lovell and the space suit worn by frank borman jim lovells apollonbsp8 space suit is on public display in the visitor center at nasas glenn research center bill anderss space suit is on display at the science museum in london united kingdom in popular culture apollo 8s historic mission has been depicted and referred to in several forms both documentary and fiction the various television transmissions and 16 mm footage shot by the crew of apollonbsp8 were compiled and released by nasa in the 1969 documentary debrief apollonbsp8 hosted by burgess meredith in addition spacecraft films released in 2003 a threedisc dvd set containing all of nasas tv and 16 mm film footage related to the mission including all tv transmissions from space training and launch footage and motion pictures taken in flight other documentaries include race to the moon 2005 as part of season 18 of american experience and in the shadow of the moon 2007 apollos daring mission aired on pbs nova in december 2018 marking the flights 50th anniversary apollo 8 serves as character development in the 1995 film apollo 13 in which jim lovell is motivated to walk on the moon by his apollo 8 experience and later disappointed to be so near the surface twice without walking on it parts of the mission are dramatized in the 1998 miniseries from the earth to the moon episode 1968 the sivb stage of apollonbsp8 was also portrayed as the location of an alien device in the 1970 ufo episode conflict apollonbsp8s lunar orbit insertion was chronicled with actual recordings in the song the other side on the 2015 album the race for space by the band public service broadcasting in the credits of the animated film free birds 2013 a newspaper front page about the apollo 8 mission is doctored to read as one of the most turbulent tragic years in american history drew to a close millions around the world were watching and listening as the apollo 8 astronauts  frank gobbler jim snood and bill wattles  became the first turkeys to orbit another world a documentary film first to the moon the journey of apollo 8 was released in 2018 the choral music piece earthrise by luke byrne commemorates the mission the piece was premièred on january 19 2020 by sydney philharmonia choirs at the sydney opera house notes references bibliography external links astronaut categories astronauts science occupations 1959 introductions an astronaut from the ancient greek ἄστρον grc meaning star and ναύτης grc meaning sailor is a person trained equipped and deployed by a human spaceflight program to serve as a commander or crew member aboard a spacecraft although generally reserved for professional space travelers the term is sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space including scientists politicians journalists and tourists astronaut technically applies to all human space travelers regardless of nationality however astronauts fielded by russia or the soviet union are typically known instead as cosmonauts from the russian kosmos космос meaning space also borrowed from greek κόσμος comparatively recent developments in crewed spaceflight made by china have led to the rise of the term taikonaut from the mandarin tàikōng 太空 meaning space although its use is somewhat informal and its origin is unclear in china the peoples liberation army astronaut corps astronauts and their foreign counterparts are all officially called hángtiānyuán 航天员 meaning heaven navigator or literally heavensailing staff since 1961 600 astronauts have flown in space until 2002 astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments either by the military or by civilian space agencies with the suborbital flight of the privately funded spaceshipone in 2004 a new category of astronaut was created the commercial astronaut definition the criteria for what constitutes human spaceflight vary with some focus on the point where the atmosphere becomes so thin that centrifugal force rather than aerodynamic force carries a significant portion of the weight of the flight object the fédération aéronautique internationale fai sporting code for astronautics recognizes only flights that exceed the kármán line at an altitude of 100 in the united states professional military and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of 80 are awarded astronaut wings 2016 552 people from 36 countries have reached 100 or more in altitude of whom 549 reached low earth orbit or beyond of these 24 people have traveled beyond low earth orbit either to lunar orbit the lunar surface or in one case a loop around the moonapollo 13 had to abort an intended lunar landing and looped around the moon to return its three astronauts to earth three of the 24jim lovell john young and eugene cernandid so twice 2016 under the us definition 558 people qualify as having reached space above 50 altitude of eight x15 pilots who exceeded 50 in altitude only one joseph a walker exceeded 100 kilometers about 621 miles and he did it two times becoming the first person in space twice space travelers have spent over 41790 mandays 1145manyears in space including over 100 astronautdays of spacewalks 2016 the man with the longest cumulative time in space is gennady padalka who has spent 879 days in space peggy a whitson holds the record for the most time in space by a woman at 675 days terminology in 1959 when both the united states and soviet union were planning but had yet to launch humans into space nasa administrator t keith glennan and his deputy administrator hugh dryden discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called astronauts or cosmonauts dryden preferred cosmonaut on the grounds that flights would occur in and to the broader cosmos while the astro prefix suggested flight specifically to the stars most nasa space task group members preferred astronaut which survived by common usage as the preferred american term when the soviet union launched the first man into space yuri gagarin in 1961 they chose a term which anglicizes to cosmonaut astronaut a professional space traveler is called an astronaut the first known use of the term astronaut in the modern sense was by neil r jones in his 1930 short story the deaths head meteor the word itself had been known earlier for example in percy gregs 1880 book across the zodiac astronaut referred to a spacecraft in les navigateurs de linfini 1925 by jh rosny aîné the word astronautique astronautics was used the word may have been inspired by aeronaut an older term for an air traveler first applied in 1784 to balloonists an early use of astronaut in a nonfiction publication is eric frank russells poem the astronaut appearing in the november 1934 bulletin of the british interplanetary society the first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual international astronautical congress in 1950 and the subsequent founding of the international astronautical federation the following year nasa applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard nasa spacecraft bound for earth orbit or beyond nasa also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its astronaut corps the european space agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its astronaut corps cosmonaut by convention an astronaut employed by the russian federal space agency or its predecessor the soviet space program is called a cosmonaut in english texts the word is an anglicization of kosmonavt космонавт kəsmɐˈnaft other countries of the former eastern bloc use variations of the russian kosmonavt such as the kosmonauta although poles also used astronauta and the two words are considered synonyms coinage of the term космонавт has been credited to soviet aeronautics or cosmonautics pioneer mikhail tikhonravov 19001974 the first cosmonaut was soviet air force pilot yuri gagarin also the first person in space he was part of the first six soviet citizens with german titov yevgeny khrunov andriyan nikolayev pavel popovich and grigoriy nelyubov who were given the title of pilotcosmonaut in january 1961 valentina tereshkova was the first female cosmonaut and the first and youngest woman to have flown in space with a solo mission on the vostok 6 in 1963 on 14 march 1995 norman thagard became the first american to ride to space on board a russian launch vehicle and thus became the first american cosmonaut taikonaut in chinese the term yǔ háng yuán 宇航员 cosmos navigating personnel is used for astronauts and cosmonauts in general while hángtiān yuán 航天员 navigating celestialheaven personnel is used for chinese astronauts here hángtiān 航天 literally heavennavigating or spaceflight is strictly defined as the navigation of outer space within the local star system ie solar system the phrase tàikōng rén 太空人 spaceman is often used in hong kong and taiwan the term taikonaut is used by some englishlanguage news media organizations for professional space travelers from china the word has featured in the longman and oxford english dictionaries and the term became more common in 2003 when china sent its first astronaut yang liwei into space aboard the shenzhou 5 spacecraft this is the term used by xinhua news agency in the english version of the chinese peoples daily since the advent of the chinese space program the origin of the term is unclear as early as may 1998 chiew lee yih 趙裡昱 from malaysia used it in newsgroups parastronaut for its 2022 astronaut group the european space agency envisioned recruiting an astronaut with a physical disability a category they called parastronauts with the intention but not guarantee of spaceflight the categories of disability considered for the program were individuals with lower limb deficiency either through amputation or congenital leg length difference or a short stature less than 130 on 23 november 2022 john mcfall was selected to be the first esa parastronaut other terms with the rise of space tourism nasa and the russian federal space agency agreed to use the term spaceflight participant to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies while no nation other than russia and previously the soviet union the united states and china have launched a crewed spacecraft several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries eg the sovietled interkosmos program inspired partly by these missions other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional english usage for example the term spationaut spationaute is sometimes used to describe french space travelers from the latin word spatium for space the malay term angkasawan deriving from angkasa meaning space was used to describe participants in the angkasawan program note its similarity with the indonesian term antariksawan plans of the indian space research organisation to launch its crewed gaganyaan spacecraft have spurred at times public discussion if another term than astronaut should be used for the crew members suggesting vyomanaut from the sanskrit word vyoman meaning sky or space or gagannaut from the sanskrit word gagan for sky in finland the nasa astronaut timothy kopra a finnish american has sometimes been referred to as sisunautti from the finnish word sisu across germanic languages the word for astronaut typically translates to space traveler as it does with germans raumfahrer dutchs ruimtevaarder swedishs rymdfarare and norwegians romfarer as of 2021 in the united states astronaut status is conferred on a person depending on the authorizing agency on july 20 2021 the faa issued an order redefining the eligibility criteria to be an astronaut in response to the private suborbital spaceflights of jeff bezos and richard branson the new criteria states that one must have demonstrated activities during flight that were essential to public safety or contributed to human space flight safety to qualify as an astronaut this new definition excludes bezos and branson space travel milestones the first human in space was soviet yuri gagarin who was launched on 12 april 1961 aboard vostok 1 and orbited around the earth for 108 minutes the first woman in space was soviet valentina tereshkova who launched on 16 june 1963 aboard vostok 6 and orbited earth for almost three days alan shepard became the first american and second person in space on 5 may 1961 on a 15minute suborbital flight aboard freedom 7 the first american to orbit the earth was john glenn aboard friendship 7 on 20 february 1962 the first american woman in space was sally ride during space shuttle challengers mission sts7 on 18 june 1983 in 1992 mae jemison became the first african american woman to travel in space aboard sts47 cosmonaut alexei leonov was the first person to conduct an extravehicular activity eva commonly called a spacewalk on 18 march 1965 on the soviet unions voskhod 2 mission this was followed two and a half months later by astronaut ed white who made the first american eva on nasas gemini 4 mission the first crewed mission to orbit the moon apollo 8 included american william anders who was born in hong kong making him the first asianborn astronaut in 1968 the soviet union through its intercosmos program allowed people from other socialist ie warsaw pact and other sovietallied countries to fly on its missions with the notable exceptions of france and austria participating in soyuz tm7 and soyuz tm13 respectively an example is czechoslovak vladimír remek the first cosmonaut from a country other than the soviet union or the united states who flew to space in 1978 on a soyuzu rocket rakesh sharma became the first indian citizen to travel to space he was launched aboard soyuz t11 on 2 april 1984 on 23 july 1980 pham tuan of vietnam became the first asian in space when he flew aboard soyuz 37 also in 1980 cuban arnaldo tamayo méndez became the first person of hispanic and black african descent to fly in space and in 1983 guion bluford became the first african american to fly into space in april 1985 taylor wang became the first ethnic chinese person in space the first person born in africa to fly in space was patrick baudry france in 1985 in 1985 saudi arabian prince sultan bin salman bin abdulaziz alsaud became the first arab muslim astronaut in space in 1988 abdul ahad mohmand became the first afghan to reach space spending nine days aboard the mir space station with the increase of seats on the space shuttle the us began taking international astronauts in 1983 ulf merbold of west germany became the first nonus citizen to fly in a us spacecraft in 1984 marc garneau became the first of eight canadian astronauts to fly in space through 2010 in 1985 rodolfo neri vela became the first mexicanborn person in space in 1991 helen sharman became the first briton to fly in space in 2002 mark shuttleworth became the first citizen of an african country to fly in space as a paying spaceflight participant in 2003 ilan ramon became the first israeli to fly in space although he died during a reentry accident on 15 october 2003 yang liwei became chinas first astronaut on the shenzhou 5 spacecraft on 30 may 2020 doug hurley and bob behnken became the first astronauts to launch on a private crewed spacecraft crew dragon age milestones the youngest person to reach space is oliver daemen who was 18 years and 11 months old when he made a suborbital spaceflight on blue origin ns16 daemen who was a commercial passenger aboard the new shepard broke the record of soviet cosmonaut gherman titov who was 25 years old when he flew vostok 2 titov remains the youngest human to reach orbit he rounded the planet 17 times titov was also the first person to suffer space sickness and the first person to sleep in space twice the oldest person to reach space is william shatner who was 90 years old when he made a suborbital spaceflight on blue origin ns18 the oldest person to reach orbit is john glenn one of the mercury 7 who was 77 when he flew on sts95 duration and distance milestones the longest time spent in space was by russian valeri polyakov who spent 438 days there as of 2006 the most spaceflights by an individual astronaut is seven a record held by both jerry l ross and franklin changdiaz the farthest distance from earth an astronaut has traveled was 401056 when jim lovell jack swigert and fred haise went around the moon during the apollo 13 emergency civilian and nongovernment milestones the first civilian in space was valentina tereshkova aboard vostok 6 she also became the first woman in space on that mission tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the ussrs air force which did not accept female pilots at that time a month later joseph albert walker became the first american civilian in space when his x15 flight 90 crossed the 100 line qualifying him by the international definition of spaceflight walker had joined the us army air force but was not a member during his flight the first people in space who had never been a member of any countrys armed forces were both konstantin feoktistov and boris yegorov aboard voskhod 1 the first nongovernmental space traveler was byron k lichtenberg a researcher from the massachusetts institute of technology who flew on sts9 in 1983 in december 1990 toyohiro akiyama became the first paying space traveler and the first journalist in space for tokyo broadcasting system a visit to mir as part of an estimated 12 million usd deal with a japanese tv station although at the time the term used to refer to akiyama was research cosmonaut akiyama suffered severe space sickness during his mission which affected his productivity the first selffunded space tourist was dennis tito on board the russian spacecraft soyuz tm3 on 28 april 2001 selffunded travelers the first person to fly on an entirely privately funded mission was mike melvill piloting spaceshipone flight 15p on a suborbital journey although he was a test pilot employed by scaled composites and not an actual paying space tourist jared isaacman was the first person to selffund a mission to orbit commanding inspiration4 in 2021 nine others have paid space adventures to fly to the international space station training the first nasa astronauts were selected for training in 1959 early in the space program military jet test piloting and engineering training were often cited as prerequisites for selection as an astronaut at nasa although neither john glenn nor scott carpenter of the mercury seven had any university degree in engineering or any other discipline at the time of their selection selection was initially limited to military pilots the earliest astronauts for both the us and the ussr tended to be jet fighter pilots and were often test pilots once selected nasa astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas including training for extravehicular activity in a facility such as nasas neutral buoyancy laboratory astronautsintraining astronaut candidates may also experience short periods of weightlessness microgravity in an aircraft called the vomit comet the nickname given to a pair of modified kc135s retired in 2000 and 2004 respectively and replaced in 2005 with a c9 which perform parabolic flights astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in highperformance jet aircraft this is mostly done in t38 jet aircraft out of ellington field due to its proximity to the johnson space center ellington field is also where the shuttle training aircraft is maintained and developed although most flights of the aircraft are conducted from edwards air force base astronauts in training must learn how to control and fly the space shuttle further it is vital that they are familiar with the international space station so they know what they must do when they get there nasa candidacy requirements the masters degree requirement can also be met by mission specialist educator mission specialist educators or educator astronauts were first selected in 2004 as of 2007 there are three nasa educator astronauts joseph m acaba richard r arnold and dorothy metcalflindenburger barbara morgan selected as backup teacher to christa mcauliffe in 1985 is considered to be the first educator astronaut by the media but she trained as a mission specialist the educator astronaut program is a successor to the teacher in space program from the 1980s health risks of space travel astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including decompression sickness barotrauma immunodeficiencies loss of bone and muscle loss of eyesight orthostatic intolerance sleep disturbances and radiation injury a variety of large scale medical studies are being conducted in space via the national space biomedical research institute nsbri to address these issues prominent among these is the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity study in which astronauts including former iss commanders leroy chiao and gennady padalka perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space this studys techniques are now being applied to cover professional and olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by nonexpert operators in medical and high school students it is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is often rare a 2006 space shuttle experiment found that salmonella typhimurium a bacterium that can cause food poisoning became more virulent when cultivated in space more recently in 2017 bacteria were found to be more resistant to antibiotics and to thrive in the nearweightlessness of space microorganisms have been observed to survive the vacuum of outer space on 31 december 2012 a nasasupported study reported that human spaceflight may harm the brain and accelerate the onset of alzheimers disease in october 2015 the nasa office of inspector general issued a health hazards report related to space exploration including a human mission to mars over the last decade flight surgeons and scientists at nasa have seen a pattern of vision problems in astronauts on longduration space missions the syndrome known as visual impairment intracranial pressure viip has been reported in nearly twothirds of space explorers after long periods spent aboard the international space station iss on 2 november 2017 scientists reported that significant changes in the position and structure of the brain have been found in astronauts who have taken trips in space based on mri studies astronauts who took longer space trips were associated with greater brain changes being in space can be physiologically deconditioning on the body it can affect the otolith organs and adaptive capabilities of the central nervous system zero gravity and cosmic rays can cause many implications for astronauts in october 2018 nasafunded researchers found that lengthy journeys into outer space including travel to the planet mars may substantially damage the gastrointestinal tissues of astronauts the studies support earlier work that found such journeys could significantly damage the brains of astronauts and age them prematurely researchers in 2018 reported after detecting the presence on the international space station iss of five enterobacter bugandensis bacterial strains none pathogenic to humans that microorganisms on iss should be carefully monitored to continue assuring a medically healthy environment for astronauts a study by russian scientists published in april 2019 stated that astronauts facing space radiation could face temporary hindrance of their memory centers while this does not affect their intellectual capabilities it temporarily hinders formation of new cells in brains memory centers the study conducted by moscow institute of physics and technology mipt concluded this after they observed that mice exposed to neutron and gamma radiation did not impact the rodents intellectual capabilities a 2020 study conducted on the brains of eight male russian cosmonauts after they returned from long stays aboard the international space station showed that longduration spaceflight causes many physiological adaptions including macro and microstructural changes while scientists still know little about the effects of spaceflight on brain structure this study showed that space travel can lead to new motor skills dexterity but also slightly weaker vision both of which could possibly be long lasting it was the first study to provide clear evidence of sensorimotor neuroplasticity which is the brains ability to change through growth and reorganization food and drink an astronaut on the international space station requires about 830 mass of food per meal each day inclusive of about 120 packaging mass per meal space shuttle astronauts worked with nutritionists to select menus that appealed to their individual tastes five months before flight menus were selected and analyzed for nutritional content by the shuttle dietician foods are tested to see how they will react in a reduced gravity environment caloric requirements are determined using a basal energy expenditure bee formula on earth the average american uses about 35 of water every day on board the iss astronauts limit water use to only about 3 per day insignia in russia cosmonauts

1729 essays 1729 in great britain 1729 books essays by jonathan swift satirical essays pamphlets works published anonymously british satire fiction about cannibalism works about ireland a modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people from being a burthen to their parents or country and for making them beneficial to the publick commonly referred to as a modest proposal is a juvenalian satirical essay written and published anonymously by jonathan swift in 1729 the essay suggests that the impoverished irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food to rich gentlemen and ladies this satirical hyperbole mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor who were predominantly irish catholic ie papists as well as british policy towards the irish in general in english writing the phrase a modest proposal is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straightfaced satire synopsis swifts essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the english language much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in ireland so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of swifts solution when he states a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food whether stewed roasted baked or boiled and i make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout swift goes to great lengths to support his argument including a list of possible preparation styles for the children and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion he uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon the theninfluential william petty and the social engineering popular among followers of francis bacon these lampoons include appealing to the authority of a very knowing american of my acquaintance in london and the famous psalmanazar a native of the island formosa who had already confessed to not being from formosa in 1706 in the tradition of roman satire swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by paralipsis population solutions george wittkowsky argued that swifts main target in a modest proposal was not the conditions in ireland but rather the cando spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills swift was especially attacking projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with a simple cureall solution a memorable example of these sorts of schemes involved the idea of running the poor through a jointstock company in response swifts modest proposal was a burlesque of projects concerning the poor that were in vogue during the early 18th century a modest proposal also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects the pamphlet targets reformers who regard people as commodities in the piece swift adopts the technique of a political arithmetician to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics critics differ about swifts intentions in using this fauxmathematical philosophy edmund wilson argues that statistically the logic of the modest proposal can be compared with defence of crime arrogated to marx in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population wittkowsky counters that swifts satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that springs from a spirit of bitter mockery not from the delight in calculations for their own sake rhetoric author charles k smith argues that swifts rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the irish swifts specific strategy is twofold using a trap to create sympathy for the irish and a dislike of the narrator who in the span of one sentence details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty but feels emotion solely for members of his own class swifts use of gripping details of poverty and his narrators cool approach towards them create two opposing points of view that alienate the reader perhaps unconsciously from a narrator who can view with melancholy detachment a subject that swift has directed us rhetorically to see in a much less detached way swift has his proposer further degrade the irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals lewis argues that the speaker uses the vocabulary of animal husbandry to describe the irish once the children have been commodified swifts rhetoric can easily turn people into animals then meat and from meat logically into tonnage worth a price per pound swift uses the proposers serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal in making his argument the speaker uses the conventional textbookapproved order of argument from swifts time which was derived from the latin rhetorician quintilian the contrast between the careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme and the ridiculousness of the proposal create a situation in which the reader has to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent thoughtful and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan influences scholars have speculated about which earlier works swift may have had in mind when he wrote a modest proposal tertullians apology james william johnson argues that a modest proposal was largely influenced and inspired by tertullians apology a satirical attack against early roman persecution of christianity johnson believes that swift saw major similarities between the two situations johnson notes swifts obvious affinity for tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works a modest proposal and apology in structure johnson points out the same central theme that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument that human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human stylistically swift and tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language in agreement with johnson donald c baker points out the similarity between both authors tones and use of irony baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic justification by ownership over the subject of sacrificing childrentertullian while attacking pagan parents and swift while attacking the english mistreatment of the irish poor defoes the generous projector it has also been argued that a modest proposal was at least in part a response to the 1728 essay the generous projector or a friendly proposal to prevent murder and other enormous abuses by erecting an hospital for foundlings and bastard children by swifts rival daniel defoe mandevilles modest defence of publick stews bernard mandevilles modest defence of publick stews asked to introduce public and

by 1705 already become famous for the fable of the bees and deliberations on private vices and public benefits john lockes first treatise of government john locke commented be it then as sir robert says that anciently it was usual for men to sell and castrate their children let it be that they exposed them add to it if you please for this is still greater power that they begat them for their tables to fat and eat them if this proves a right to do so we may by the same argument justifie adultery incest and sodomy for there are examples of these too both ancient and modern sins which i suppose have the principle aggravation from this that they cross the main intention of nature which willeth the increase of mankind and the continuation of the species in the highest perfection and the distinction of families with the security of the marriage bed as necessary thereunto first treatise sec 59 economic themes robert phiddians article have you eaten yet the reader in a modest proposal focuses on two aspects of a modest proposal the voice of swift and the voice of the proposer phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satirical voice of jonathan swift and the apparent economic projections of the proposer he reminds readers that there is a gap between the narrators meaning and the texts and that a moralpolitical argument is being carried out by means of parody while swifts proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal george wittkowsky author of swifts modest proposal the biography of an early georgian pamphlet argues that to understand the piece fully it is important to understand the economics of swifts time wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labour in 18thcentury england if one regards the modest proposal simply as a criticism of condition about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that swifts irony brilliantly underscored this fact people are the riches of a nation at the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century it was believed that people are the riches of the nation and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less furthermore in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry in those times the somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity louis a landa composed a conducive analysis when he noted that it would have been healthier for the irish economy to more appropriately utilize their human assets by giving the people an opportunity to become a source of wealth to the nation or else they must turn to begging and thievery this opportunity may have included giving the farmers more coin to work for diversifying their professions or even consider enslaving their people to lower coin usage and build up financial stock in ireland landa wrote that swift is maintaining that the maximpeople are the riches of a nationapplies to ireland only if ireland is permitted slavery or cannibalism landa presents swifts a modest proposal as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that people are the riches of a nation swift presents the dire state of ireland and shows that mere population itself in irelands case did not always mean greater wealth and economy the uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer not richer swift also recognises the implications of this fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens swift however landa argues is not merely criticising economic maxims but also addressing the fact that england was denying irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanising them by viewing them as a mere commodity public reaction swifts essay created a backlash within british society after its publication the work was aimed at the aristocracy and they responded in turn several members of society wrote to swift regarding the work lord bathursts letter 12 february 172930 intimated that he certainly understood the message and interpreted it as a work of comedy modern usage a modest proposal is included in many literature courses as an example of early modern western satire it also serves as an introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language lending itself to secondary and postsecondary essay courses outside of the realm of english studies a modest proposal is included in many comparative and global literature and history courses as well as those

colspan2 styletextalignleft   period  2  3  4  5  6  7 legend the alkali metals consist of the chemical elements lithium li sodium na potassium k rubidium rb caesium cs and francium fr together with hydrogen they constitute group 1 which lies in the sblock of the periodic table all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an sorbital this shared electron configuration results in their having very similar characteristic properties indeed the alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table with elements exhibiting wellcharacterised homologous behaviour this family of elements is also known as the lithium family after its leading element the alkali metals are all shiny soft highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge 1 they can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen and in the case of lithium nitrogen because of their high reactivity they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements caesium the fifth alkali metal is the most reactive of all the metals all the alkali metals react with water with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones all of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds in order of abundance sodium is the most abundant followed by potassium lithium rubidium caesium and finally francium which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity francium occurs only in minute traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of element 119 which is likely to be the next member of the group none were successful however ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues most alkali metals have many different applications one of the bestknown applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in atomic clocks of which caesium atomic clocks form the basis of the second a common application of the compounds of sodium is the sodiumvapour lamp which emits light very efficiently table salt or sodium chloride has been used since antiquity lithium finds use as a psychiatric medication and as an anode in lithium batteries sodium potassium and possibly lithium are essential elements having major biological roles as electrolytes and although the other alkali metals are not essential they also have various effects on the body both beneficial and harmful history sodium compounds have been known since ancient times salt sodium chloride has been an important commodity in human activities as testified by the english word salary referring to salarium money paid to roman soldiers for the purchase of saltaugust 2020 while potash has been used since ancient times it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts georg ernst stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702 and henrilouis duhamel du monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736 the exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium was not known then and thus antoine lavoisier did not include either alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789 pure potassium was first isolated in 1807 in england by humphry davy who derived it from caustic potash koh potassium hydroxide by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile previous attempts at electrolysis of the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due to potassiums extreme reactivity68 potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis later that same year davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda naoh lye by a similar technique demonstrating the elements and thus the salts to be different petalite lialsi4o10 was discovered in 1800 by the brazilian chemist josé bonifácio de andrada in a mine on the island of utö sweden however it was not until 1817 that johan august arfwedson then working in the laboratory of the chemist jöns jacob berzelius detected the presence of a new element while analysing petalite ore this new element was noted by him to form compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline than the other alkali metals berzelius gave the unknown material the name lithionlithina from the greek word λιθoς transliterated as lithos meaning stone to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral as opposed to potassium which had been discovered in plant ashes and sodium which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood he named the metal inside the material lithium lithium sodium and potassium were part of the discovery of periodicity as they are among a series of triads of elements in the same group that were noted by johann wolfgang döbereiner in 1850 as having similar properties rubidium and caesium were the first elements to be discovered using the spectroscope invented in 1859 by robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff the next year they discovered caesium in the mineral water from bad dürkheim germany their discovery of rubidium came the following year in heidelberg germany finding it in the mineral lepidolite the names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra a bright red line for rubidium from the latin word rubidus meaning dark red or bright red and a skyblue line for caesium derived from the latin word caesius meaning skyblue around 1865 john newlands produced a series of papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar physical and chemical properties that recurred at intervals of eight he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions his version put all the alkali metals then known lithium to caesium as well as copper silver and thallium which show the 1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals together into a group his table placed hydrogen with the halogens after 1869 dmitri mendeleev proposed his periodic table placing lithium at the top of a group with sodium potassium rubidium caesium and thallium two years later mendeleev revised his table placing hydrogen in group 1 above lithium and also moving thallium to the boron group in this 1871 version copper silver and gold were placed twice once as part of group ib and once as part of a group viii encompassing todays groups 8 to 11 after the introduction of the 18column table the group ib elements were moved to their current position in the dblock while alkali metals were left in group ia later the groups name was changed to group 1 in 1988 the trivial name alkali metals comes from the fact that the hydroxides of the group 1 elements are all strong alkalis when dissolved in water there were at least four erroneous and incomplete discoveries before marguerite perey of the curie institute in paris france discovered francium in 1939 by purifying a sample of actinium227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220 kev however perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80 kev perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product one that was separated during purification but emerged again out of the pure actinium227 various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium radium lead bismuth or thallium the new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal such as coprecipitating with caesium salts which led perey to believe that it was element 87 caused by the alpha decay of actinium227 perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium227 her first test put the alpha branching at 06 a figure that she later revised to 1 the next element below francium ekafrancium in the periodic table would be ununennium uue element 11917291730 the synthesis of ununennium was first attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of einsteinium254 with calcium48 ions at the superhilac accelerator at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in berkeley california no atoms were identified leading to a limiting yield of 300 nb it is highly unlikely that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of einsteinium254 which is favoured for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass relatively long halflife of 270 days and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories and in quantities smaller than those needed for effective synthesis of superheavy elements however given that ununennium is only the first period 8 element on the extended periodic table it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions and indeed an attempt to synthesise it is currently ongoing in japan currently none of the period 8 elements has been discovered yet and it is also possible due to drip instabilities that only the lower period 8 elements up to around element 128 are physically possible no attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals due to their extremely high atomic number they would require new more powerful methods and technology to make17371739 occurrence in the solar system the oddoharkins rule holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers with the exception of hydrogen this rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another thus increasing their atomic number in elements with even atomic numbers protons are paired with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other enhancing stability all the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals in the solar system the heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesised in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both big bang nucleosynthesis and in stars the big bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 nucleons and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the triplealpha process fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon and skipping over those three elements on earth the earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the sun but the planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system in turn the natural history of the earth caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements the mass of the earth is approximately 59824 kg it is composed mostly of iron 321 oxygen 301 silicon 151 magnesium 139 sulfur 29 nickel 18 calcium 15 and aluminium 14 with the remaining 12 consisting of trace amounts of other elements due to planetary differentiation the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron 888 with smaller amounts of nickel 58 sulfur 45 and less than 1 trace elements the alkali metals due to their high reactivity do not occur naturally in pure form in nature they are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the earths surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica forming relatively lowdensity minerals that do not sink down into the earths core potassium rubidium and caesium are also incompatible elements due to their large ionic radii sodium and potassium are very abundant on earth both being among the ten most common elements in earths crust sodium makes up approximately 26 of the earths crust measured by weight making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal potassium makes up approximately 15 of the earths crust and is the seventh most abundant element sodium is found in many different minerals of which the most common is ordinary salt sodium chloride which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater other solid deposits include halite amphibole cryolite nitratine and zeolite many of these solid deposits occur as a result of ancient seas evaporating which still occurs now in places such as utahs great salt lake and the dead sea69 despite their nearequal abundance in earths crust sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean both because potassiums larger size makes its salts less soluble and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium69 despite its chemical similarity lithium typically does not occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size69 due to its relatively low reactivity it can be found in seawater in large amounts it is estimated that lithium concentration in seawater is approximately 014 to 025 parts per million ppm or 25 micromolar its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals where its crustal concentration is about 18 ppm comparable to that of gallium and niobium commercially the most important lithium mineral is spodumene which occurs in large deposits worldwide69 rubidium is approximately as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper it occurs naturally in the minerals leucite pollucite carnallite zinnwaldite and lepidolite although none of these contain only rubidium and no other alkali metals70 caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements such as antimony cadmium tin and tungsten but is much less abundant than rubidium francium223 the only naturally occurring isotope of francium is the product of the alpha decay of actinium227 and can be found in trace amounts in uranium minerals in a given sample of uranium there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1018 uranium atoms it has been calculated that there are at most 30 grams of francium in the earths crust at any time due to its extremely short halflife of 22 minutes properties physical and chemical the physical and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns1 valence electron configuration which results in weak metallic bonding hence all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities melting and boiling points as well as heats of sublimation vaporisation and dissociation74 they all crystallise in the bodycentered cubic crystal structure73 and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited75 indeed these flame test colours are the most common way of identifying them since all their salts with common ions are soluble75 the ns1 configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity75 their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost sorbital to form the 1 oxidation state due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy76 most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group the chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity thus the presentation of its properties here is limited what little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium as expected the physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations the alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other indeed the similarity is so great that it is quite difficult to separate potassium rubidium and caesium due to their similar ionic radii lithium and sodium are more distinct for instance when moving down the table all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius decreasing electronegativity increasing reactivity and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation75 in general their densities increase when moving down the table with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium one of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials lithiums value is anomalous being more negative than the others75 this is because the li ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly causing a higher change in entropy this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase75 the stable alkali metals are all silvercoloured metals except for caesium which has a pale golden tint it is one of only three metals that are clearly coloured the other two being copper and gold74 additionally the heavy alkaline earth metals calcium strontium and barium as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium are pale yellow though the colour is much less prominent than it is for caesium74 their lustre tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation all the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature because of this they are usually stored in mineral oil or kerosene paraffin oil they react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride lif the alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care the heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones for example when dropped into water caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if the same number of moles of each metal is used the alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron not only do the alkali metals react with water but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols gaseous ammonia and alkynes the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides76 the second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high as it is in a full shell that is also closer to the nucleus thus they almost always lose a single electron forming cations28 the alkalides are an exception they are unstable compounds which contain alkali metals in a 1 oxidation state which is very unusual as before the discovery of the alkalides the alkali metals were not expected to be able to form anions and were thought to be able to appear in salts only as cations the alkalide anions have filled ssubshells which gives them enough stability to exist all the stable alkali metals except lithium are known to be able to form alkalides and the alkalides have much theoretical interest due to their unusual stoichiometry and low ionisation potentials alkalides are chemically similar to the electrides which are salts with trapped electrons acting as anions a particularly striking example of an alkalide is inverse sodium hydride hna both ions being complexed as opposed to the usual sodium hydride nah it is unstable in isolation due to its high energy resulting from the displacement of two electrons from hydrogen to sodium although several derivatives are predicted to be metastable or stable in aqueous solution the alkali metal ions form aqua ions of the formula mh2on where n is the solvation number their coordination numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii in aqueous solution the water molecules directly attached to the metal ion are said to belong to the first coordination sphere also known as the first or primary solvation shell the bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a dative covalent bond with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond each coordinated water molecule may be attached by hydrogen bonds to other water molecules the latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere however for the alkali metal cations the second coordination sphere is not welldefined as the 1 charge on the cation is not high enough to polarise the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere producing a more stable entity25 the solvation number for li has been experimentally determined to be 4 forming the tetrahedral lih2o4 while solvation numbers of 3 to 6 have been found for lithium aqua ions solvation numbers less than 4 may be the result of the formation of contact ion pairs and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach lih2o4 through a face of the tetrahedron though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an octahedral hexaaqua ion there are also probably six water molecules in the primary solvation sphere of the sodium ion forming the octahedral nah2o6 ion126127 while it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed octahedral hexaaqua ions it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the kh2o8 and rbh2o8 ions which have the square antiprismatic structure and that caesium forms the 12coordinate csh2o12 ion lithium the chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small li cation polarises anions and gives its compounds a more covalent character lithium and magnesium have a diagonal relationship due to their similar atomic radii so that they show some similarities for example lithium forms a stable nitride a property common among all the alkaline earth metals magnesiums group but unique among the alkali metals in addition among their respective groups only lithium and magnesium form organometallic compounds with significant covalent character eg lime and mgme2 lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water and lithium hydroxide is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent conversely lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals probably because li has a high solvation energy76 this effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide to be used in dehumidifiers and airconditioners76 francium francium is also predicted to show some differences due to its high atomic weight causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions of the speed of light and thus making relativistic effects more prominent in contrast to the trend of decreasing electronegativities and ionisation energies of the alkali metals franciums electronegativity and ionisation energy are predicted to be higher than caesiums due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons also its atomic radius is expected to be abnormally low thus contrary to expectation caesium is the most reactive of the alkali metals not francium1729 all known physical properties of francium also deviate from the clear trends going from lithium to caesium such as the first ionisation energy electron affinity and anion polarisability though due to the paucity of known data about francium many sources give extrapolated values ignoring that relativistic effects make the trend from lithium to caesium become inapplicable at francium some of the few properties of francium that have been predicted taking relativity into account are the electron affinity 472 kjmol and the enthalpy of dissociation of the fr2 molecule 421 kjmol the csfr molecule is polarised as csfr showing that the 7s subshell of francium is much more strongly affected by relativistic effects than the 6s subshell of caesium additionally francium superoxide fro2 is expected to have significant covalent character unlike the other alkali metal superoxides because of bonding contributions from the 6p electrons of francium nuclear all the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers hence their isotopes must be either oddodd both proton and neutron number are odd or oddeven proton number is odd but neutron number is even oddodd nuclei have even mass numbers whereas oddeven nuclei have odd mass numbers oddodd primordial nuclides are rare because most oddodd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay because the decay products are eveneven and are therefore more strongly bound due to nuclear pairing effects due to the great rarity of oddodd nuclei almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are oddeven the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium6 and the longlived radioisotope potassium40 for a given odd mass number there can be only a single betastable nuclide since there is not a difference in binding energy between evenodd and oddeven comparable to that between eveneven and oddodd leaving other nuclides of the same mass number isobars free to beta decay toward the lowestmass nuclide an effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that oddnumbered elements such as the alkali metals tend to have fewer stable isotopes than evennumbered elements of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons beryllium is the single exception to both rules due to its low atomic number all of the alkali metals except lithium and caesium have at least one naturally occurring radioisotope sodium22 and sodium24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically potassium40 and rubidium87 have very long halflives and thus occur naturally and all isotopes of francium are radioactive caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes francium had not been discovered yet at that time the natural longlived radioisotope of potassium potassium40 makes up about 0012 of natural potassium and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive this natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 the next alkali metal after caesium in 1925 natural rubidium is similarly slightly radioactive with 2783 being the longlived radioisotope rubidium8774 caesium137 with a halflife of 3017 years is one of the two principal mediumlived fission products along with strontium90 which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling up to several hundred years after use it constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the chernobyl accident caesium137 undergoes highenergy beta decay and eventually becomes stable barium137 it is a strong emitter of gamma radiation caesium137 has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way but must be allowed to decay caesium137 has been used as a tracer in hydrologic studies analogous to the use of tritium small amounts of caesium134 and caesium137 were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents most notably the goiânia accident and the chernobyl disaster as of 2005 caesium137 is the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around the chernobyl nuclear power plant its chemical properties as one of the alkali metals make it one of the most problematic of the shorttomediumlifetime fission products because it easily moves and spreads in nature due to the high water solubility of its salts and is taken up by the body which mistakes it for its essential congeners sodium and potassium114 periodic trends the alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other for instance when moving down the table all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius decreasing electronegativity increasing reactivity and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation75 in general their densities increase when moving down the table with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium atomic and ionic radii the atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group because of the shielding effect when an atom has more than one electron shell each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus in the alkali metals the outermost electron only feels a net charge of 1 as some of the nuclear charge which is equal to the atomic number is cancelled by the inner electrons the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge therefore the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells since this number increases down the group the atomic radius must also increase down the group the ionic radii of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii this is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different electron shell than the inner electrons and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller additionally the effective nuclear charge has increased and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases first ionisation energy the first ionisation energy of an element or molecule is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one mole of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with electric charge 1 the factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the nuclear charge the amount of shielding by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus which is always an outer electron in main group elements the first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge 1 the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus since this distance increases down the group the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases this trend is broken in francium due to the relativistic stabilisation and contraction of the 7s orbital bringing franciums valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from nonrelativistic calculations this makes franciums outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium1729 the second ionisation energy of the alkali metals is much higher than the first as the secondmost loosely held electron is part of a fully filled electron shell and is thus difficult to remove reactivity the reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group this is the result of a combination of two factors the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions thus increasing reactivity down the group the atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to but not equal to the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance this quantity decreases going down the group and so does the activation energy thus chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group electronegativity electronegativity is a chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons or electron density towards itself if the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is 7 in chlorine but is only 1 in sodium the electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom an ionic bond however if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium hence the larger alkali metal atoms further down the group will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them as mentioned previously francium is expected to be an exception because of the higher electronegativity of lithium some of its compounds have a more covalent character for example lithium iodide lii will dissolve in organic solvents a property of most covalent compounds lithium fluoride lif is the only alkali halide that is not soluble in water and lithium hydroxide lioh is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent melting and boiling points the melting point of a substance is the point where it changes state from solid to liquid while the boiling point of a substance in liquid state is the point where the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state to gas as a metal is heated to its melting point the metallic bonds keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metals boiling point therefore the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group this is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons as the atoms increase in size going down the group because their atomic radius increases the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond becomes weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil thus lowering the melting and boiling points the increased nuclear charge is not a relevant factor due to the shielding effect density the alkali metals all have the same crystal structure bodycentred cubic and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms since density is defined as mass per unit volume the first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius which increases going down the group thus the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group the mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group thus the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii if figures for these two factors are known the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated the resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table with an exception at potassium due to having the lowest atomic weight and the largest atomic radius of all the elements in their periods the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table lithium sodium and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water in fact lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature75 compounds the alkali metals form complete series of compounds with all usually encountered anions which well illustrate group trends these compounds can be described as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions79 this description is most accurate for alkali halides and becomes less and less accurate as cationic and anionic charge increase and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable for instance ionic bonding gives way to metallic bonding along the series nacl na2o na2s na3p na3as na3sb na3bi na81 hydroxides all the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water producing an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas this reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group lithium reacts steadily with effervescence but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers when an alkali metal is dropped into water it produces an explosion of which there are two separate stages the metal reacts with the water first breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals second the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air this secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water lake or other body of water not the initial reaction of the metal with water which tends to happen mostly under water the alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides87 recent research has suggested that the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself all alkali metals melt as a part of the reaction with water water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal leaving a positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions the attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area causing an exponential increase of ionisation when the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension it vigorously explodes the hydroxides themselves are the most basic hydroxides known reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give oligomeric alkoxides they easily react with carbon dioxide to form carbonates or bicarbonates or with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfides or bisulfides and may be used to separate thiols from petroleum they react with amphoteric oxides for example the oxides of aluminium zinc tin and lead react with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates zincates stannates and plumbates silicon dioxide is acidic and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack silicate glass87 intermetallic compounds the alkali metals form many intermetallic compounds with each other and the elements from groups 2 to 13 in the periodic table of varying stoichiometries81 such as the sodium amalgams with mercury including na5hg8 and na3hg some of these have ionic characteristics taking the alloys with gold the most electronegative of metals as an example naau and kau are metallic but rbau and csau are semiconductors81 nak is an alloy of sodium and potassium that is very useful because it is liquid at room temperature although precautions must be taken due to its extreme reactivity towards water and air the eutectic mixture melts at 126 c an alloy of 41 caesium 47 sodium and 12 potassium has the lowest known melting point of any metal or alloy 78 c compounds with the group 13 elements the intermetallic compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group 13 elements aluminium gallium indium and thallium such as natl are poor conductors or semiconductors unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements implying that the alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the zintl anions involved nevertheless while the elements in group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters group 13 elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice for example natl consists of a polymeric anion tln with a covalent diamond cubic structure with na ions located between the anionic lattice the larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group 13 elements to form anionic clusters boron is a special case being the only nonmetal in group 13 the alkali metal borides tend to be boronrich involving appreciable boronboron bonding involving deltahedral structures1478 and are thermally unstable due to the alkali metals having a very high vapour pressure at elevated temperatures this makes direct synthesis problematic because the alkali metals do not react with boron below 700 c and thus this must be accomplished in sealed containers with the alkali metal in excess furthermore exceptionally in this group reactivity with boron decreases down the group lithium reacts completely at 700 c but sodium at 900 c and potassium not until 1200 c and the reaction is instantaneous for lithium but takes hours for potassium rubidium and caesium borides have not even been characterised various phases are known such as lib10 nab6 nab15 and kb6 under high pressure the boronboron bonding in the lithium borides changes from following wades rules to forming zintl anions like the rest of group 13 compounds with the group 14 elements lithium and sodium react with carbon to form acetylides li2c2 and na2c2 which can also be obtained by reaction of the metal with acetylene potassium rubidium and caesium react with graphite their atoms are intercalated between the hexagonal graphite layers forming graphite intercalation compounds of formulae mc60 dark grey almost black mc48 dark grey almost black mc36 blue mc24 steel blue and mc8 bronze m  k rb or cs these compounds are over 200 times more electrically conductive than pure graphite suggesting that the valence electron of the alkali metal is transferred to the graphite layers eg mc8 upon heating of kc8 the elimination of potassium atoms results in the conversion in sequence to kc24 kc36 kc48 and finally kc60 kc8 is a very strong reducing agent and is pyrophoric and explodes on contact with water while the larger alkali metals k rb and cs initially form mc8 the smaller ones initially form mc6 and indeed they require reaction of the metals with graphite at high temperatures around 500 c to form apart from this the alkali metals are such strong reducing agents that they can even reduce buckminsterfullerene to produce solid fullerides mnc60 sodium potassium rubidium and caesium can form fullerides where n  2 3 4 or 6 and rubidium and caesium additionally can achieve n  1285 when the alkali metals react with the heavier elements in the carbon group silicon germanium tin and lead ionic substances with cagelike structures are formed such as the silicides m4si4 m  k rb or cs which contains m and tetrahedral si44 ions the chemistry of alkali metal germanides involving the germanide ion ge4 and other cluster zintl ions such as ge42 ge94 ge92 and ge926 is largely analogous to that of the corresponding silicides393 alkali metal stannides are mostly ionic sometimes with the stannide ion sn4 and sometimes with more complex zintl ions such as sn94 which appears in tetrapotassium nonastannide k4sn9 the monatomic plumbide ion pb4 is unknown and indeed its formation is predicted to be energetically unfavourable alkali metal plumbides have complex zintl ions such as pb94 these alkali metal germanides stannides and plumbides may be produced by reducing germanium tin and lead with sodium metal in liquid ammonia394 nitrides and pnictides lithium the lightest of the alkali metals is the only alkali metal which reacts with nitrogen at standard conditions and its nitride is the only stable alkali metal nitride nitrogen is an unreactive gas because breaking the strong triple bond in the dinitrogen molecule n2 requires a lot of energy the formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal forming m ions the energy required to break the triple bond in n2 and the formation of n3 ions and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the lattice energy of the alkali metal nitride the lattice energy is maximised with small highly charged ions the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions only forming ions with a charge of 1 so only lithium the smallest alkali metal can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen exothermic forming lithium nitride the reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be endothermic so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions sodium nitride na3n and potassium nitride k3n while existing are extremely unstable being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions steric hindrance forbids the existence of rubidium or caesium nitride417 however sodium and potassium form colourless azide salts involving the linear n3 anion due to the large size of the alkali metal cations they are thermally stable enough to be able to melt before decomposing417 all the alkali metals react readily with phosphorus and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula m3pn where m represents an alkali metal and pn represents a pnictogen  phosphorus arsenic antimony or bismuth this is due to the greater size of the p3 and as3 ions so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form these are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals for example potassium has nine different known phosphides with formulae k3p k4p3 k5p4 kp k4p6 k3p7 k3p11 kp103 and kp15 while most metals form arsenides only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides the structure of na3as is complex with unusually short nana distances of 328330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula m3as are known such as lias which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding the antimonides are unstable and reactive as the sb3 ion is a strong reducing agent reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine sbh3 indeed they have some metallic properties and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry msb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral zintl structure bismuthides are not even wholly ionic they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds oxides and chalcogenides all the alkali metals react vigorously with oxygen at standard conditions they form various types of oxides such as simple oxides containing the o2 ion peroxides containing the o22 ion where there is a single bond between the two oxygen atoms superoxides containing the o2 ion and many others lithium burns in air to form lithium oxide but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of sodium oxide and sodium peroxide potassium forms a mixture of potassium peroxide and potassium superoxide while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively their reactivity increases going down the group while lithium sodium and potassium merely burn in air rubidium and caesium are pyrophoric spontaneously catch fire in air the smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the larger anions the peroxide and superoxide due to their small size this attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom this causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature this effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium allowing them to form the less stable peroxides rubidium and caesium at the bottom of the group are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised the oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions in addition the small size of the li and o2 ions contributes to their forming a stable ionic lattice structure under controlled conditions however all the alkali metals with the exception of francium are known to form their oxides peroxides and superoxides the alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful oxidising agents sodium peroxide and potassium superoxide react with carbon dioxide to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas which allows them to be used in submarine air purifiers the presence of water vapour naturally present in breath makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient all the stable alkali metals except lithium can form red ozonides mo3 through lowtemperature reaction of the powdered anhydrous hydroxide with ozone the ozonides may be then extracted using liquid ammonia they slowly decompose at standard conditions to the superoxides and oxygen and hydrolyse immediately to the hydroxides when in contact with water85 potassium rubidium and caesium also form sesquioxides m2o3 which may be better considered peroxide disuperoxides m4o22o2285 rubidium and caesium can form a great variety of suboxides with the metals in formal oxidation states below 185 rubidium can form rb6o and rb9o2 coppercoloured upon oxidation in air while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides such as the ozonide cso3 and several brightly coloured suboxides such as cs7o bronze cs4o redviolet cs11o3 violet cs3o dark green cso cs3o2 as well as cs7o2 the last of these may be heated under vacuum to generate cs2o the alkali metals can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens sulfur selenium tellurium and polonium and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known with the exception of franciums reaction with an excess of the chalcogen can similarly result in lower chalcogenides with chalcogen ions containing chains of the chalcogen atoms in question for example sodium can react with sulfur to form the sulfide na2s and various polysulfides with the formula na2sx x from 2 to 6 containing the s ions due to the basicity of the se2 and te2 ions the alkali metal selenides and tellurides are alkaline in solution when reacted directly with selenium and tellurium alkali metal polyselenides and polytellurides are formed along with the selenides and tellurides with the se and te ions they may be obtained directly from the elements in liquid ammonia or when air is not present and are colourless watersoluble compounds that air oxidises quickly back to selenium or tellurium766 the alkali metal polonides are all ionic compounds containing the po2 ion they are very chemically stable and can be produced by direct reaction of the elements at around 300400 c766 halides hydrides and pseudohalides the alkali metals are among the most electropositive elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table the halogens fluorine chlorine bromine iodine and astatine forming salts known as the alkali metal halides the reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions76 all twenty stable alkali metal halides are known the unstable ones are not known with the exception of sodium astatide because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium the most wellknown of the twenty is certainly sodium chloride otherwise known as common salt all of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula mx where m is an alkali metal and x is a halogen they are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points all the alkali metal halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride lif which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy the high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the li and f ions causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong a similar effect occurs for magnesium fluoride consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium76 the alkali metals also react similarly with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides where the hydride anion acts as a pseudohalide these are often used as reducing agents producing hydrides complex metal hydrides or hydrogen gas83 other pseudohalides are also known notably the cyanides these are isostructural to the respective halides except for lithium cyanide indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely322 ternary alkali metal halide oxides such as na3clo k3bro yellow na4br2o na4i2o and k4br2o are also known83 the polyhalides are rather unstable although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these extremely large cations835 coordination complexes alkali metal cations do not usually form coordination complexes with simple lewis bases due to their low charge of just 1 and their relatively large size thus the li ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less though exceptions occur for weak complexes90 lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12 although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode901 in aqueous solution the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes mh2o6 with the exception of the lithium ion which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes lih2o4 the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules because of this anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers eg 12crown4 for li 15crown5 for na 18crown6 for k and 21crown7 for rb and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction ammonia solutions the alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid ammonia forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated metal cation m and solvated electron e which react to form hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide mnh2 where m represents an alkali metal this was first noted by humphry davy in 1809 and rediscovered by w weyl in 1864 the process may be speeded up by a catalyst similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium strontium barium as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium the amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals in 1907 charles a kraus identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions at low concentrations below 3 m the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride at higher concentrations above 3 m the solution is coppercoloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury in addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation m the neutral alkali metal atom m diatomic alkali metal molecules m2 and alkali metal anions m these are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis organometallic organolithium being the smallest alkali metal lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds which are bonded covalently organolithium compounds are electrically nonconducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures and tend to form oligomers with the structure rlix where r is the organic group as the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom effectively creating a carbanion organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles for use as bases butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available an example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ch3lix which exists in tetrameric x  4 tetrahedral and hexameric x  6 octahedral forms organolithium compounds especially nbutyllithium are useful reagents in organic synthesis as might be expected given lithiums diagonal relationship with magnesium which plays an important role in the grignard reaction102 for example alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls the reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl for example proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde using h as the electrophile or ketone using an alkyl halide product105 alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may also react with nndisubstituted amides to give aldehydes and ketones and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide they thermally decompose to eliminate a βhydrogen producing alkenes and lithium hydride another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl and aryllithiums that act as strong bases105 in nonpolar solvents aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids arco2h and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols ar2caroh finally they may be used to synthesise other organometallic compounds through metalhalogen exchange106 heavier alkali metals unlike the organolithium compounds the organometallic compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic the application of organosodium compounds in chemistry is limited in part due to competition from organolithium compounds which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity the principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility a notable reagent is schlossers base a mixture of nbutyllithium and potassium tertbutoxide this reagent reacts with propene to form the compound allylpotassium kch2chch2 cis2butene and trans2butene equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals whereas isomerisation is fast with lithium and sodium it is slow with the heavier alkali metals the heavier alkali metals also favour the sterically congested conformation several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported establishing that they like the sodium compounds are polymeric organosodium organopotassium organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble or nearly so in nonpolar solvents alkyl and aryl derivatives of sodium and potassium tend to react with air they cause the cleavage of ethers generating alkoxides unlike alkyllithium compounds alkylsodiums and alkylpotassiums cannot be made by reacting the metals with alkyl halides because wurtz coupling occurs265 as such they have to be made by reacting alkylmercury compounds with sodium or potassium metal in inert hydrocarbon solvents while methylsodium forms tetramers like methyllithium methylpotassium is more ionic and has the nickel arsenide structure with discrete methyl anions and potassium cations265 the alkali metals and their hydrides react with acidic hydrocarbons for example cyclopentadienes and terminal alkynes to give salts liquid ammonia ether or hydrocarbon solvents are used the most common of which being tetrahydrofuran the most important of these compounds is sodium cyclopentadienide nac5h5 an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives265 similarly the alkali metals react with cyclooctatetraene in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal cyclooctatetraenides for example dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide k2c8h8 is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives such as uranocene266 the large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large aromatic polarisable radical anions such as the darkgreen sodium naphthalenide nac10h8 a strong reducing agent266 representative reactions of alkali metals reaction with oxygen upon reacting with oxygen alkali metals form oxides peroxides superoxides and suboxides however the first three are more common the table below shows the types of compounds formed in reaction with oxygen the compound in brackets represents the minor product of combustion the alkali metal peroxides are ionic compounds that are unstable in water the peroxide anion is weakly bound to the cation and it is hydrolysed forming stronger covalent bonds the other oxygen compounds are also unstable in water reaction with sulfur with sulfur they form sulfides and polysulfides because alkali metal sulfides are essentially salts of a weak acid and a strong base they form basic solutions reaction with nitrogen lithium is the only metal that combines directly with nitrogen at room temperature li3n can react with water to liberate ammonia reaction with hydrogen with hydrogen alkali metals form saline hydrides that hydrolyse in water reaction with carbon lithium is the only metal that reacts directly with carbon to give dilithium acetylide na and k can react with acetylene to give acetylides reaction with water on reaction with water they generate hydroxide ions and hydrogen gas this reaction is vigorous and highly exothermic and the hydrogen resulted may ignite in air or even explode in the case of rb and cs reaction with other salts the alkali metals are very good reducing agents they can reduce metal cations that are less electropositive titanium is produced industrially by the reduction of titanium tetrachloride with na at 400 c van arkelde boer process reaction with organohalide compounds alkali metals react with halogen derivatives to generate hydrocarbon via the wurtz reaction alkali metals in liquid ammonia alkali metals dissolve in liquid ammonia or other donor solvents like aliphatic amines or hexamethylphosphoramide to give blue solutions these solutions are believed to contain free electrons due to the presence of solvated electrons these solutions are very powerful reducing agents used in organic synthesis reaction 1 is known as birch reduction other reductions that can be carried by these solutions are extensions although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of hypothetical heavier alkali metals being the first period 8 element the undiscovered element ununennium element 119 is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners however it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties17291730 its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium17291730 instead of caesium or francium this is unusual as periodic trends ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium this lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununenniums valence electron increasing ununenniums first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii this effect is already seen for francium17291730 this assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal which although likely may not be true due to relativistic effects the relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununenniums electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium indeed ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium17291730 on the other hand ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group being expected to have a melting point between 0 c and 30 c1724 the stabilisation of ununenniums valence electron and thus the contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240 pm17291730 very close to that of rubidium 247 pm so that the chemistry of ununennium in the 1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium on the other hand the ionic radius of the uue ion is predicted to be larger than that of rb because the 7p orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the porbitals of the lower shells ununennium may also show the 317291730 and 5 oxidation states which are not seen in any other alkali metal28 in addition to the 1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the 7p32 spinor causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected2817291730 indeed many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character due to the involvement of the 7p32 electrons in the bonding not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table by the aufbau principle would put element 169 unhexennium under ununennium diracfock calculations predict that the next element after ununennium with alkalimetallike properties may be element 165 unhexpentium which is predicted to have the electron configuration og 5g18 6f14 7d10 8s2 8p122 9s117291730 this element would be intermediate in properties between an alkali metal and a group 11 element and while its physical and atomic properties would be closer to the former its chemistry may be closer to that of the latter further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium and that it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium17291730 however the 7d electrons of unhexpentium may also be able to participate in chemical reactions along with the 9s electron possibly allowing oxidation states beyond 1 whence the likely transition metal behaviour of unhexpentium17321733 due to the alkali and alkaline earth metals both being sblock elements these predictions for the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly hold quite similarly for the corresponding alkaline earth metals unbinilium ubn and unhexhexium uhh17291733 unsepttrium element 173 may be an even better heavier homologue of ununennium with a predicted electron configuration of usb 6g1 it returns to the alkalimetallike situation of having one easily removed electron far above a closed pshell in energy and is expected to be even more reactive than caesium the probable properties of further alkali metals beyond unsepttrium have not been explored yet as of 2019 and they may or may not be able to exist in periods 8 and above of the periodic table relativistic and shellstructure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate in addition the relativistic and shellstructure effects which stabilise the sorbitals and destabilise and expand the d f and gorbitals of higher shells have opposite effects causing even larger difference between relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers17321733 interest in the chemical properties of ununennium unhexpentium and unsepttrium stems from the fact that they are located close to the expected locations of islands of stability centered at elements 122 306ubb and 164 482uhq pseudoalkali metals many other substances are similar to the alkali metals in their tendency to form monopositive cations analogously to the pseudohalogens they have sometimes been called pseudoalkali metals these substances include some elements and many more polyatomic ions the polyatomic ions are especially similar to the alkali metals in their large size and weak polarising power hydrogen the element hydrogen with one electron per neutral atom is usually placed at the top of group 1 of the periodic table because of its electron configuration but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal metallic hydrogen which only exists at very high pressures is known for its electrical and magnetic properties not its chemical properties under typical conditions pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule h2 however the alkali metals form diatomic molecules such as dilithium li2 only at high temperatures when they are in the gaseous state hydrogen like the alkali metals has one valence electron and reacts easily with the halogens but the similarities mostly end there because of the small size of a bare proton h compared to the alkali metal cations its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration it is sometimes placed above fluorine due to their similar chemical properties though the resemblance is likewise not absolute the first ionisation energy of hydrogen 13120 kjmol is much higher than that of the alkali metals as only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom hydrogen often behaves like a halogen forming the negative hydride ion and is very occasionally considered to be a halogen on that basis the alkali metals can also form negative ions known as alkalides but these are little more than laboratory curiosities being unstable an argument against this placement is that formation of hydride from hydrogen is endothermic unlike the exothermic formation of halides from halogens the radius of the h anion also does not fit the trend of increasing size going down the halogens indeed h is very diffuse because its single proton cannot easily control both electrons156 it was expected for some time that liquid hydrogen would show metallic properties while this has been shown to not be the case under extremely high pressures such as those found at the cores of jupiter and saturn hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal in this phase it is known as metallic hydrogen the electrical resistivity of liquid metallic hydrogen at 3000 k is approximately equal to that of liquid rubidium and caesium at 2000 k at the respective pressures when they undergo a nonmetaltometal transition the 1s1 electron configuration of hydrogen while analogous to that of the alkali metals ns1 is unique because there is no 1p subshell hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron h or gain one to form the hydride ion h43 in the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals in the latter case the halogens but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well43 group 14 is also a good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionisation energy and electron affinity but hydrogen cannot be tetravalent thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory although group 1 is the most common placement if one is chosen because of the electron configuration and the fact that the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species being the foundation of acidbase chemistry as an example of hydrogens unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual electron configuration and small size the hydrogen ion is very small radius around 150 fm compared to the 50220 pm size of most other atoms and ions and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules indeed transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acidbase chemistry43 also unique is hydrogens ability to form hydrogen bonds which are an effect of chargetransfer electrostatic and electron correlative contributing phenomena while analogous lithium bonds are also known they are mostly electrostatic nevertheless hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals especially lithium ammonium and derivatives the ammonium ion nh4 has very similar properties to the heavier alkali metals acting as an alkali metal intermediate between potassium and rubidium and is often considered a close relative for example most alkali metal salts are soluble in water a property which ammonium salts share ammonium is expected to behave stably as a metal nh4 ions in a sea of delocalised electrons at very high pressures though less than the typical pressure where transitions from insulating to metallic behaviour occur around 100 gpa and could possibly occur inside the ice giants uranus and neptune which may have significant impacts on their interior magnetic fields it has been estimated that the transition from a mixture of ammonia and dihydrogen molecules to metallic ammonium may occur at pressures just below 25 gpa under standard conditions ammonium can form a metallic amalgam with mercury other pseudoalkali metals include the alkylammonium cations in which some of the hydrogen atoms in the ammonium cation are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups in particular the quaternary ammonium cations nr4 are very useful since they are permanently charged and they are often used as an alternative to the expensive cs to stabilise very large and very easily polarisable anions such as hi28129 tetraalkylammonium hydroxides like alkali metal hydroxides are very strong bases that react with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form carbonates256 furthermore the nitrogen atom may be replaced by a phosphorus arsenic or antimony atom the heavier nonmetallic pnictogens creating a phosphonium ph4 or arsonium ash4 cation that can itself be substituted similarly while stibonium sbh4 itself is not known some of its organic derivatives are characterised cobaltocene and derivatives cobaltocene coc5h52 is a metallocene the cobalt analogue of ferrocene it is a dark purple solid cobaltocene has 19 valence electrons one more than usually found in organotransition metal complexes such as its very stable relative ferrocene in accordance with the 18electron rule this additional electron occupies an orbital that is antibonding with respect to the coc bonds consequently many chemical reactions of coc5h52 are characterized by its tendency to lose this extra electron yielding a very stable 18electron cation known as cobaltocenium many cobaltocenium salts coprecipitate with caesium salts and cobaltocenium hydroxide is a strong base that absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form cobaltocenium carbonate256 like the alkali metals cobaltocene is a strong reducing agent and decamethylcobaltocene is stronger still due to the combined inductive effect of the ten methyl groups cobalt may be substituted by its heavier congener rhodium to give rhodocene an even stronger reducing agent iridocene involving iridium would presumably be still more potent but is not very wellstudied due to its instability thallium thallium is the heaviest stable element in group 13 of the periodic table at the bottom of the periodic table the inertpair effect is quite strong because of the relativistic stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high ionisation energies of the 6s electrons2267 it displays the 1 oxidation state28 that all the known alkali metals display28 and thallium compounds with thallium in its 1 oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the tl 164 pm k 152 pm and ag 129 pm ions it was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental europe but not in england in the years immediately following its discovery126 and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in dmitri mendeleevs 1869 periodic table and julius lothar meyers 1868 periodic table mendeleevs 1871 periodic table and meyers 1870 periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and left the space below caesium blank however thallium also displays the oxidation state 328 which no known alkali metal displays28 although ununennium the undiscovered seventh alkali metal is predicted to possibly display the 3 oxidation state17291730 the sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium while tl is stabilised by the inertpair effect this inert pair of 6s electrons is still able to participate chemically so that these electrons are stereochemically active in aqueous solution additionally the thallium halides except tlf are quite insoluble in water and tli has an unusual structure because of the presence of the stereochemically active inert pair in thallium copper silver and gold the group 11 metals or coinage metals copper silver and gold are typically categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete dshells physically they have the relatively low melting points and high electronegativity values associated with posttransition metals the filled d subshell and free s electron of cu ag and au contribute to their high electrical and thermal conductivity transition metals to the left of group 11 experience interactions between s electrons and the partially filled d subshell that lower electron mobility chemically the group 11 metals behave like maingroup metals in their 1 valence states and are hence somewhat related to the alkali metals this is one reason for their previously being labelled as group ib paralleling the alkali metals group ia they are occasionally classified as posttransition metals their spectra are analogous to those of the alkali metals their monopositive ions are paramagnetic and contribute no colour to their salts like those of the alkali metals in mendeleevs 1871 periodic table copper silver and gold are listed twice once under group viii with the iron triad and platinum group metals and once under group ib group ib was nonetheless parenthesised to note that it was tentative mendeleevs main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element on that basis the group 11 elements could not be classified in group ib due to the existence of copperii and goldiii compounds being known at that time however eliminating group ib would make group i the only main group group viii was labelled a transition group to lack an ab bifurcation soon afterward a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group ib and remove them from group viii for the resulting symmetry this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern mediumlong 18column periodic table which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals the coinage metals were traditionally regarded as a subdivision of the alkali metal group due to them sharing the characteristic s1 electron configuration of the alkali metals group 1 p6s1 group 11 d10s1 however the similarities are largely confined to the stoichiometries of the 1 compounds of both groups and not their chemical properties1177 this stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals1177 furthermore they have higher melting points hardnesses and densities and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia as well as having more covalent character in their compounds1177 finally the alkali metals are at the top of the electrochemical series whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom1177 the coinage metals filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals filled p shell so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower enabling higher oxidation states than 1 and a richer coordination chemistry thus giving the group 11 metals clear transition metal character1177 particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium in which it forms the auride ion au which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution here gold behaves as a pseudohalogen because its 5d106s1 configuration has one electron less than the quasiclosed shell 5d106s2 configuration of mercury1177 production and isolation the production of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances such as water from their silicate ores all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminiumiii ions from the ore leaching whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide the remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride the result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture the heavier alkali metals however are more typically isolated in a different way where a reducing agent typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride the liquid or gaseous product the alkali metal then undergoes fractional distillation for purification most routes to the pure alkali metals require the use of electrolysis due to their high reactivity one of the few which does not is the pyrolysis of the corresponding alkali metal azide which yields the metal for sodium potassium rubidium and caesium and the nitride for lithium77 lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of mineral springs brine pools and brine deposits the metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused lithium chloride and potassium chloride sodium occurs mostly in seawater and dried seabed but is now produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700 c through the use of a downs cell extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide potassium occurs in many minerals such as sylvite potassium chloride previously potassium was generally made from the electrolysis of potassium chloride or potassium hydroxide found extensively in places such as canada russia belarus germany israel united states and jordan in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s it can also be produced from seawater however these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its molten chloride and vaporises significantly at the operating temperatures potentially forming the explosive superoxide as a result pure potassium metal is now produced by reducing molten potassium chloride with sodium metal at 850 c74 although sodium is less reactive than potassium this process works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than sodium and can easily be distilled off so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion74 metals like sodium are obtained by electrolysis of molten salts rb  cs obtained mainly as by products of li processing to make pure caesium ores of caesium and rubidium are crushed and heated to 650 c with sodium metal generating an alloy that can then be separated via a fractional distillation technique because metallic caesium is too reactive to handle it is normally offered as caesium azide csn3 caesium hydroxide is formed when caesium interacts aggressively with water and ice csoh for several years in the 1950s and 1960s a byproduct of the potassium production called alkarb was a main source for rubidium alkarb contained 21 rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium today the largest producers of caesium for example the tanco mine in manitoba canada produce rubidium as byproduct from pollucite today a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium is the fractional crystallisation of a rubidium and caesium alum cs rbalso4212h2o which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately 30 recrystallisations the limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limit the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year caesium however is not produced from the above reaction instead the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium extracted from the ore mainly by three methods acid digestion alkaline decomposition and direct reduction both metals are produced as byproducts of lithium production after 1958 when interest in lithiums thermonuclear properties increased sharply the production of rubidium and caesium also increased correspondingly71 pure rubidium and caesium metals are produced by reducing their chlorides with calcium metal at 750 c and low pressure74 as a result of its extreme rarity in nature most francium is synthesised in the nuclear reaction 197au  18o  210fr  5 n yielding francium209 francium210 and francium211 the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300000 neutral atoms which were synthesised using the nuclear reaction given above when the only natural isotope francium223 is specifically required it is produced as the alpha daughter of actinium227 itself produced synthetically from the neutron irradiation of natural radium226 one of the daughters of natural uranium238 applications lithium sodium and potassium have many applications while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts but do not have many applications yet68 lithium is often used in lithiumion batteries and lithium oxide can help process silica lithium stearate is a thickener and can be used to make lubricating greases it is produced from lithium hydroxide which is also used to absorb carbon dioxide in space capsules and submarines70 lithium chloride is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys70 sodium compounds have many applications the most wellknown being sodium chloride as table salt sodium salts of fatty acids are used as soap pure sodium metal also has many applications including use in sodiumvapour lamps which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting and can help smooth the surface of other metals being a strong reducing agent it is often used to reduce many other metals such as titanium and zirconium from their chlorides furthermore it is very useful as a heatexchange liquid in fast breeder nuclear reactors due to its low melting point viscosity and crosssection towards neutron absorption74 potassium compounds are often used as fertilisers73 as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition potassium hydroxide is a very strong base and is used to control the ph of various substances potassium nitrate and potassium permanganate are often used as powerful oxidising agents73 potassium superoxide is used in breathing masks as it reacts with carbon dioxide to give potassium carbonate and oxygen gas pure potassium metal is not often used but its alloys with sodium may substitute for pure sodium in fast breeder nuclear reactors74 rubidium and caesium are often used in atomic clocks caesium atomic clocks are extraordinarily accurate if a clock had been made at the time of the dinosaurs it would be off by less than four seconds after 80 million years for that reason caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second rubidium ions are often used in purple fireworks and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry francium has no commercial applications but because of franciums relatively simple atomic structure among other things it has been used in spectroscopy experiments leading to more information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles studies on the light emitted by lasertrapped francium210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels similar to those predicted by quantum theory biological role and precautions metals pure alkali metals are dangerously reactive with air and water and must be kept away from heat fire oxidising agents acids most organic compounds halocarbons plastics and moisture they also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride so that normal fire extinguishers are counterproductive when used on alkali metal fires some class d dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are effective depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the alkali metal experiments are usually conducted using only small quantities of a few grams in a fume hood small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive isopropanol the alkali metals must be stored under mineral oil or an inert atmosphere the inert atmosphere used may be argon or nitrogen gas except for lithium which reacts with nitrogen rubidium and caesium must be kept away from air even under oil because even a small amount of air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive peroxide for the same reason potassium should not be stored under oil in an oxygencontaining atmosphere for longer than 6 months ions the bioinorganic chemistry of the alkali metal ions has been extensively reviewed solid state crystal structures have been determined for many complexes of alkali metal ions in small peptides nucleic acid constituents carbohydrates and ionophore complexes lithium naturally only occurs in traces in biological systems and has no known biological role but does have effects on the body when ingested lithium carbonate is used as a mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder manicdepression in daily doses of about 05 to 2 grams although there are sideeffects excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness slurred speech and vomiting among other symptoms and poisons the central nervous system which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage its biochemistry the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified sodium and potassium occur in all known biological systems generally functioning as electrolytes inside and outside cells sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume blood pressure osmotic equilibrium and ph the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day sodium chloride also known as common salt is the principal source of sodium in the diet and is used as seasoning and preservative such as for pickling and jerky most of it comes from processed foods the dietary reference intake for sodium is 15 grams per day but most people in the united states consume more than 23 grams per day the minimum amount that promotes hypertension this in turn causes 76 million premature deaths worldwide potassium is the major cation positive ion inside animal cells while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells the concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells known as the membrane potential the balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion transporter proteins in the cell membrane the cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell to generate an action potentiala spike of electrical discharge the ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission muscle contraction and heart function disruption of this balance may thus be fatal for example ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to hyperkalemia strongly influencing the cardiovascular system potassium chloride is used in the united states for lethal injection executions due to their similar atomic radii rubidium and caesium in the body mimic potassium and are taken up similarly rubidium has no known biological role but may help stimulate metabolism and similarly to caesium replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency partial substitution is quite possible and rather nontoxic a 70 kg person contains on average 036 g of rubidium and an increase in this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons rats can survive up to 50 substitution of potassium by rubidium rubidium and to a much lesser extent caesium can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems caesium is never able to do so there is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in goats even if this is true the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough caesium compounds are rarely encountered by most people but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic like rubidium caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body but is significantly larger and is therefore a poorer substitute excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia arrythmia and acute cardiac arrest but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources as such caesium is not a major chemical environmental pollutant the median lethal dose ld50 value for caesium chloride in mice is 23 g per kilogram which is comparable to the ld50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment radioisotopes of caesium require special precautions the improper handling of caesium137 gamma ray sources can lead to release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries perhaps the bestknown case is the goiânia accident of 1987 in which an improperlydisposedof radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic in the city of goiânia brazil was scavenged from a junkyard and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious uneducated buyers this led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure together with caesium134 iodine131 and strontium90 caesium137 was among the isotopes distributed by the chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short halflife but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk notes references alphabet categories alphabets orthography an alphabet is a standard set of letters written to represent particular sounds in a spoken language specifically letters correspond to phonemes the categories of sounds that can distinguish one word from another in a given language not all writing systems represent language in this way a syllabary assigns symbols to spoken syllables while logographies assign symbols to words morphemes or other semantic units the first letters were invented in ancient egypt to serve as an aid in writing egyptian hieroglyphs these are referred to as egyptian uniliteral signs by lexicographers this system was used until the 5th century ad and fundamentally differed by adding pronunciation hints to existing hieroglyphs that had previously carried no pronunciation information later on these phonemic symbols also became used to transcribe foreign words the first fully phonemic script was the protosinaitic script also descending from egyptian hieroglyphics which was later modified to create the phoenician alphabet the phoenician system is considered the first true alphabet and is the ultimate ancestor of many modern scripts including arabic cyrillic greek hebrew latin and possibly brahmic peter t daniels distinguishes true alphabetswhich use letters to represent both consonants and vowelsfrom both abugidas and abjads which only need letters for consonants abjads generally lack vowel indicators altogether while abugidas represent them with diacritics added to letters in this narrower sense the greek alphabet was the first true alphabet it was originally derived from the phoenician alphabet which was an abjad alphabets usually have a standard ordering for their letters this makes alphabets a useful tool in collation as words can be listed in a welldefined ordercommonly known as alphabetical order this also means that letters may be used as a method of numbering ordered items letters also have names in some languages this is known as acrophony and it is present in scripts including greek arabic hebrew and syriac however acrophony is not present in all languages such as the latin alphabet which simply adds a vowel after the character representing each letter some systems also used to have acrophony but later abandoned it such as cyrillic etymology the english word alphabet came into middle english from the late latin word alphabetum which in turn originated in the greek ἀλφάβητος alphábētos it was made from the first two letters of the greek alphabet alpha α and beta β the names for the greek letters in turn came from the first two letters of the phoenician alphabet aleph the word for ox and bet the word for house history alphabets related to phoenician ancient near eastern alphabets the ancient egyptian writing system had a set of some 24 hieroglyphs that are called uniliterals which are glyphs that provide one sound these glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms to write grammatical inflections and later to transcribe loan words and foreign names the script was used a fair amount in the 4th century ce however after pagan temples were closed down it was forgotten in the 5th century until the discovery of the rosetta stone there was also cuneiform primarily used to write several ancient languages including sumerian the last known use of the cuneiform script was in 75 ce after which the script fell out of use in the middle bronze age an apparently alphabetic system known as the protosinaitic script appeared in egyptian turquoise mines in the sinai peninsula around 1840 bce apparently left by canaanite workers orly goldwasser has connected the illiterate turquoise miner graffiti theory to the origin of the alphabet in 1999 american egyptologists john and deborah darnell discovered an earlier version of this first alphabet at the wadi elhol valley the script dated to 1800 bce and shows evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to 2000 bce strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had developed about that time the script was based on letter appearances and names believed to be based on egyptian hieroglyphs this script had no characters representing vowels originally it probably was a syllabarya script where syllables are represented with characterswith symbols that were not needed being removed the bestattested bronze age alphabet is ugaritic invented in ugarit before the 15th century bce this was an alphabetic cuneiform script with 30 signs including three that indicate the following vowel this script was not used after the destruction of ugarit in 1178 bce the protosinaitic script eventually developed into the phoenician alphabet conventionally called protocanaanite before 1050 bce the oldest text in phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of king ahiram 1000 bce this script is the parent script of all western alphabets by the 10th century bce two other forms distinguish themselves canaanite and aramaic the aramaic gave rise to the hebrew alphabet the south arabian alphabet a sister script to the phoenician alphabet is the script from which the geez abugida was descended abugidas are writing systems with characters comprising consonantvowel sequences alphabets without obligatory vowels are called abjads with examples being arabic hebrew and syriac the omission of vowels was not always a satisfactory solution due to the need of preserving sacred texts weak consonants are used to indicate vowels these letters have a dual function since they can also be used as pure consonants the protosinaitic script and the ugaritic script were the first scripts with a limited number of signs instead of using many different signs for words in contrast to cuneiform egyptian hieroglyphs and linear b the phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters making it a script simple enough for traders to learn another advantage of the phoenician alphabet was that it could write different languages since it recorded words phonemically the phoenician script was spread across the mediterranean by the phoenicians the greek alphabet was the first alphabet in which vowels have independent letter forms separate from those of consonants the greeks chose letters representing sounds that did not exist in phoenician to represent vowels the linear b syllabary used by mycenaean greeks from the 16th century bce had 87 symbols including five vowels in its early years there were many variants of the greek alphabet causing many different alphabets to evolve from it european alphabets the greek alphabet in euboean form was carried over by greek colonists to the italian peninsula 800600 bce giving rise to many different alphabets used to write the italic languages like the etruscan alphabet one of these became the latin alphabet which spread across europe as the romans expanded their republic after the fall of the western roman empire the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works it came to be used for the descendant languages of latin the romance languages and most of the other languages of western and central europe today it is the most widely used script in the world the etruscan alphabet remained nearly unchanged for several hundred years only evolving once the etruscan language changed itself the letters used for nonexistent phonemes were dropped afterwards however the alphabet went through many different changes the final classical form of etruscan contained 20 letters four of them are vowels a e i and u six fewer letters than the earlier forms the script in its classical form was used until the 1st century ce the etruscan language itself was not used in imperial rome but the script was used for religious texts some adaptations of the latin alphabet have ligatures a combination of two letters make one such as æ in danish and icelandic and ȣ in algonquian borrowings from other alphabets such as the thorn þ in old english and icelandic which came from the futhark runes and modified existing letters such as the eth ð of old english and icelandic which is a modified d other alphabets only use a subset of the latin alphabet such as hawaiian and italian which uses the letters j k x y and w only in foreign words another notable script is elder futhark believed to have evolved out of one of the old italic alphabets elder futhark gave rise to other alphabets known collectively as the runic alphabets the runic alphabets were used for germanic languages from 100 ce to the late middle ages being engraved on stone and jewelry although inscriptions found on bone and wood occasionally appear these alphabets have since been replaced with the latin alphabet the exception was for decorative use where the runes remained in use until the 20th century the old hungarian script was the writing system of the hungarians it was in use during the entire history of hungary albeit not as an official writing system from the 19th century it once again became more and more popular the glagolitic alphabet was the initial script of the liturgical language old church slavonic and became together with the greek uncial script the basis of the cyrillic script cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts and is notable for its use in slavic languages and also for other languages within the former soviet union cyrillic alphabets include serbian macedonian bulgarian russian belarusian and ukrainian the glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by saints cyril and methodius while the cyrillic alphabet was created by clement of ohrid their disciple they feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by greek and hebrew asian alphabets many phonetic scripts exist in asia the arabic alphabet hebrew alphabet syriac alphabet and other abjads of the middle east are developments of the aramaic alphabet most alphabetic scripts of india and eastern asia descend from the brahmi script believed to be a descendant of aramaic european alphabets especially latin and cyrillic have been adapted for many languages of asia arabic is also widely used sometimes as an abjad as with urdu and persian and sometimes as a complete alphabet as with kurdish and uyghur other alphabets hangul in korea sejong the great created the hangul alphabet in 1443 ce hangul is a unique alphabet it is a featural alphabet where the design of many of the letters comes from a sounds place of articulation like p looking like the widened mouth and l looking like the tongue pulled in the creation of hangul was planned by the government of the day and it places individual letters in syllable clusters with equal dimensions in the same way as chinese characters this change allows for mixedscript writing where one syllable always takes up one type space no matter how many letters get stacked into building that one soundblock zhuyin zhuyin sometimes referred to as bopomofo is a semisyllabary it transcribes mandarin phonetically in the republic of china after the later establishment of the peoples republic of china and its adoption of hanyu pinyin the use of zhuyin today is limited however it is still widely used in taiwan zhuyin developed from a form of chinese shorthand based on chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary like an alphabet the phonemes of syllable initials are represented by individual symbols but like a syllabary the phonemes of the syllable finals are not each possible final excluding the medial glide has its own character an example being luan written as ㄌㄨㄢ luan the last symbol ㄢ takes place as the entire final an while zhuyin is not a mainstream writing system it is still often used in ways similar to a romanization system for aiding pronunciation and as an input method for chinese characters on computers and cellphones types the term alphabet is used by linguists and paleographers in both a wide and a narrow sense in a broader sense an alphabet is a segmental script at the phoneme levelthat is it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words in the narrower sense some scholars distinguish true alphabets from two other types of segmental script abjads and abugidas these three differ in how they treat vowels abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels unexpressed abugidas are also consonantbased but indicate vowels with diacritics a systematic graphic modification of the consonants the earliest known alphabet using this sense is the wadi elhol script believed to be an abjad its successor phoenician is the ancestor of modern alphabets including arabic greek latin via the old italic alphabet cyrillic via the greek alphabet and hebrew via aramaic examples of presentday abjads are the arabic and hebrew scripts true alphabets include latin cyrillic and korean hangul and abugidas used to write tigrinya amharic hindi and thai the canadian aboriginal syllabics are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their name would imply because each glyph stands for a consonant and is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel in a true syllabary each consonantvowel combination gets represented by a separate glyph all three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs ugaritic for example is essentially an abjad but has syllabic letters for ʔa ʔi ʔu these are the only times that vowels are indicated coptic has a letter for ti devanagari is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels though some traditions use अ as a zero consonant as the graphic base for such vowels the boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clearcut for example sorani kurdish is written in the arabic script which when used for other languages is an abjad in kurdish writing the vowels is mandatory and whole letters are used so the script is a true alphabet other languages may use a semitic abjad with forced vowel diacritics effectively making them abugidas on the other hand the phagspa script of the mongol empire was based closely on the tibetan abugida but vowel marks are written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks although short a is not written as in the indic abugidas the source of the term abugida namely the geez abugida now used for amharic and tigrinya has assimilated into their consonant modifications it is no longer systematic and must be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script even more extreme the pahlavi abjad eventually became logographic thus the primary categorisation of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels for tonal languages further classification can be based on their treatment of tone though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types some alphabets disregard tone entirely especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load as in somali and many other languages of africa and the americas most commonly tones are indicated by diacritics which is how vowels are treated in abugidas which is the case for vietnamese a true alphabet and thai an abugida in thai the tone is determined primarily by a consonant with diacritics for disambiguation in the pollard script an abugida vowels are indicated by diacritics the placing of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone more rarely a script may have separate letters for tones as is the case for hmong and zhuang for many regardless of whether letters or diacritics get used the most common tone is not marked just as the most common vowel is not marked in indic abugidas in zhuyin not only is one of the tones unmarked but there is a diacritic to indicate a lack of tone like the virama of indic alphabetical order alphabets often come to be associated with a standard ordering of their letters this is for collationnamely for listing words and other items in alphabetical order latin alphabets the basic ordering of the latin alphabet a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z which derives from the northwest semitic abgad order is already well established although languages using this alphabet have different conventions for their treatment of modified letters such as the french é à and ô and certain combinations of letters multigraphs in french these are not considered to be additional letters for collation however in icelandic the accented letters such as á í and ö are considered distinct letters representing different vowel sounds from sounds represented by their unaccented counterparts in spanish ñ is considered a separate letter but accented vowels such as á and é are not the ll and ch were also formerly considered single letters and sorted separately after l and c but in 1994 the tenth congress of the association of spanish language academies changed the collating order so that ll came to be sorted between lk and lm in the dictionary and ch came to be sorted between cg and ci those digraphs were still formally designated as letters but in 2010 the real academia española changed it so they are no longer considered letters at all in german words starting with sch which spells the german phoneme ʃ are inserted between words with initial sca and sci all incidentally loanwords instead of appearing after the initial sz as though it were a single letter which contrasts several languages such as albanian in which dh ë gj ll rr th xh and zh which all represent phonemes and considered separate single letters would follow the letters d e g l n r t x and z respectively as well as hungarian and welsh further german words with an umlaut get collated ignoring the umlaut ascontrary to turkish which adopted the graphemes ö and ü and where a word like tüfek would come after tuz in the dictionary an exception is the german telephone directory where umlauts are sorted like äae since names such as jäger also appear with the spelling jaeger and are not distinguished in the spoken language the danish and norwegian alphabets end with æøå whereas the swedish conventionally put åäö at the end however æ phonetically corresponds with ä as does ø and ö early alphabets it is unknown whether the earliest alphabets had a defined sequence some alphabets today such as the hanunoo script are learned one letter at a time in no particular order and are not used for collation where a definite order is required however a dozen ugaritic tablets from the fourteenth century bce preserve the alphabet in two sequences one the abcde order later used in phoenician has continued with minor changes in hebrew greek armenian gothic cyrillic and latin the other hmħlq was used in southern arabia and is preserved today in ethiopic both orders have therefore been stable for at least 3000 years runic used an unrelated futhark sequence which got simplified later on arabic uses usually uses its sequence although arabic retains the traditional abjadi order which is used for numbers the brahmic family of alphabets used in india uses a unique order based on phonology the letters are arranged according to how and where the sounds get produced in the mouth this organization is present in southeast asia tibet korean hangul and even japanese kana which is not an alphabet acrophony in phoenician each letter got associated with a word that begins with that sound this is called acrophony and is continuously used to varying degrees in samaritan aramaic syriac hebrew greek and arabic acrophony got abandoned in latin it referred to the letters by adding a vowel usually e sometimes a or u before or after the consonant two exceptions were y and z which were borrowed from the greek alphabet rather than etruscan they were known as y graeca greek y and zeta from greekthis discrepancy was inherited by many european languages as in the term zed for z in all forms of english other than american english over time names sometimes shifted or were added as in double u for w or double v in french the english name for y and the american zee for z comparing them in english and french gives a clear reflection of the great vowel shift a b c and d are pronounced eɪ biː siː diː in todays english but in contemporary french they are a be se de the french names from which the english names got derived preserve the qualities of the english vowels before the great vowel shift by contrast the names of f l m n and s ɛf ɛl ɛm ɛn ɛs remain the same in both languages because short vowels were largely unaffected by the shift in cyrillic originally acrophony was present using slavic words the first three words going azŭ buky vědě with the cyrillic collation order being а б в however this was later abandoned in favor of a system similar to latin orthography and pronunciation when an alphabet is adopted or developed to represent a given language an orthography generally comes into being providing rules for spelling words following the principle on which alphabets get based these rules will map letters of the alphabet to the phonemes of the spoken language in a perfectly phonemic orthography there would be a consistent onetoone correspondence between the letters and the phonemes so that a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation and a speaker would always know the pronunciation of a word given its spelling and vice versa however this ideal is usually never achieved in practice languages can come close to it such as spanish and finnish others such as english deviate from it to a much larger degree the pronunciation of a language often evolves independently of its writing system writing systems have been borrowed for languages the orthography was not initially made to use the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies languages may fail to achieve a onetoone correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways national languages sometimes elect to address the problem of dialects by associating the alphabet with the national standard some national languages like finnish armenian turkish russian serbocroatian serbian croatian and bosnian and bulgarian have a very regular spelling system with nearly onetoone correspondence between letters and phonemes similarly the italian verb corresponding to spell out compitare is unknown to many italians because spelling is usually trivial as italian spelling is highly phonemic in standard spanish one can tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling but not vice versa as phonemes sometimes can be represented in more than one way but a given letter is consistently pronounced french using silent letters nasal vowels and elision may seem to lack much correspondence between the spelling and pronunciation however its rules on pronunciation though complex are consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy at the other extreme are languages such as english where pronunciations mostly have to be memorized as they do not correspond to the spelling consistently for english this is because the great vowel shift occurred after the orthography got established and because english has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times retaining their original spelling at varying levels however even english has general albeit complex rules that predict pronunciation from spelling rules like this are usually successful however rules to predict spelling from pronunciation have a higher failure rate sometimes countries have the written language undergo a spelling reform to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language these can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system for example turkey switched from the arabic alphabet to a latinbased turkish alphabet and kazakh changed from an arabic script to a cyrillic script due to the soviet unions influence in 2021 it made a transition to the latin alphabet similar to turkish the cyrillic script used to be official in uzbekistan and turkmenistan before they switched to the latin alphabet uzbekistan is reforming the alphabet to use diacritics on the letters that are marked by apostrophes and the letters that are digraphs the standard system of symbols used by linguists to represent sounds in any language independently of orthography is called the international phonetic alphabet see also references bibliography further reading external links atomic number categories chemical properties nuclear physics atoms dimensionless numbers of chemistry numbers the atomic number or nuclear charge number symbol z of a chemical element is the charge number of an atomic nucleus for ordinary nuclei composed of protons and neutrons this is equal to the proton number np or the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element the atomic number can be used to uniquely identify ordinary chemical elements in an ordinary uncharged atom the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons for an ordinary atom which contains protons neutrons and electrons the sum of the atomic number z and the neutron number n gives the atoms atomic mass number a since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes and the mass defect of the nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass the atomic mass of any atom when expressed in daltons making a quantity called the relative isotopic mass is within 1 of the whole number a atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers and hence different mass numbers are known as isotopes a little more than threequarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes see monoisotopic elements and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element called the relative atomic mass in a defined environment on earth determines the elements standard atomic weight historically it was these atomic weights of elements in comparison to hydrogen that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century the conventional symbol z comes from the german word zahl number which before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics merely denoted an elements numerical place in the periodic table whose order was then approximately but not completely consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights only after 1915 with the suggestion and evidence that this z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms did the word atomzahl and its english equivalent atomic number come into common use in this context the rules above do not always apply to exotic atoms which contain shortlived elementary particles other than protons neutrons and electrons history the periodic table and a natural number for each element loosely speaking the existence or construction of a periodic table of elements creates an ordering of the elements and so they can be numbered in order dmitri mendeleev claimed that he arranged his first periodic tables first published on march 6 1869 in order of atomic weight atomgewicht however in consideration of the elements observed chemical properties he changed the order slightly and placed tellurium atomic weight 1276 ahead of iodine atomic weight 1269 this placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number z but that number was not known or suspected at the time a simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory in addition to the case of iodine and tellurium several other pairs of elements such as argon and potassium cobalt and nickel were later shown to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights thus requiring their placement in the periodic table to be determined by their chemical properties however the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar lanthanide elements whose atomic number was not obvious led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the periodic numbering of elements at least from lutetium element 71 onward hafnium was not known at this time the rutherfordbohr model and van den broek in 1911 ernest rutherford gave a model of the atom in which a central nucleus held most of the atoms mass and a positive charge which in units of the electrons charge was to be approximately equal to half of the atoms atomic weight expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms this central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight though it was almost 25 different from the atomic number of gold z a the single element from which rutherford made his guess nevertheless in spite of rutherfords estimation that gold had a central charge of about 100 but was element z on the periodic table a month after rutherfords paper appeared antonius van den broek first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom were exactly equal to its place in the periodic table also known as element number atomic number and symbolized z this eventually proved to be the case moseleys 1913 experiment the experimental position improved dramatically after research by henry moseley in 1913 moseley after discussions with bohr who was at the same lab and who had used van den broeks hypothesis in his bohr model of the atom decided to test van den broeks and bohrs hypothesis directly by seeing if spectral lines emitted from excited atoms fitted the bohr theorys postulation that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to the square of z to do this moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions k and l lines produced by the elements from aluminium z  13 to gold z  79 used as a series of movable anodic targets inside an xray tube the square root of the frequency of these photons xrays increased from one target to the next in an arithmetic progression this led to the conclusion moseleys law that the atomic number does closely correspond with an offset of one unit for klines in moseleys work to the calculated electric charge of the nucleus ie the element number z among other things moseley demonstrated that the lanthanide series from lanthanum to lutetium inclusive must have 15 membersno fewer and no morewhich was far from obvious from known chemistry at that time missing elements after moseleys death in 1915 the atomic numbers of all known elements from hydrogen to uranium z  92 were examined by his method there were seven elements with z  92 which were not found and therefore identified as still undiscovered corresponding to atomic numbers 43 61 72 75 85 87 and 91 from 1918 to 1947 all seven of these missing elements were discovered by this time the first four transuranium elements had also been discovered so that the periodic table was complete with no gaps as far as curium z  96 the proton and the idea of nuclear electrons in 1915 the reason for nuclear charge being quantized in units of z which were now recognized to be the same as the element number was not understood an old idea called prouts hypothesis had postulated that the elements were all made of residues or protyles of the lightest element hydrogen which in the bohrrutherford model had a single electron and a nuclear charge of one however as early as 1907 rutherford and thomas royds had shown that alpha particles which had a charge of 2 were the nuclei of helium atoms which had a mass four times that of hydrogen not two times if prouts hypothesis were true something had to be neutralizing some of the charge of the hydrogen nuclei present in the nuclei of heavier atoms in 1917 rutherford succeeded in generating hydrogen nuclei from a nuclear reaction between alpha particles and nitrogen gas and believed he had proven prouts law he called the new heavy nuclear particles protons in 1920 alternate names being proutons and protyles it had been immediately apparent from the work of moseley that the nuclei of heavy atoms have more than twice as much mass as would be expected from their being made of hydrogen nuclei and thus there was required a hypothesis for the neutralization of the extra protons presumed present in all heavy nuclei a helium nucleus was presumed to be composed of four protons plus two nuclear electrons electrons bound inside the nucleus to cancel two of the charges at the other end of the periodic table a nucleus of gold with a mass 197 times that of hydrogen was thought to contain 118 nuclear electrons in the nucleus to give it a residual charge of 79 consistent with its atomic number the discovery of the neutron makes z the proton number all consideration of nuclear electrons ended with james chadwicks discovery of the neutron in 1932 an atom of gold now was seen as containing 118 neutrons rather than 118 nuclear electrons and its positive nuclear charge now was realized to come entirely from a content of 79 protons since moseley had previously shown that the atomic number z of an element equals this positive charge it was now clear that z is identical to the number of protons of its nuclei chemical properties each element has a specific set of chemical properties as a consequence of the number of electrons present in the neutral atom which is z the atomic number the configuration of these electrons follows from the principles of quantum mechanics the number of electrons in each elements electron shells particularly the outermost valence shell is the primary factor in determining its chemical bonding behavior hence it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an element and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of any mixture of atoms with a given atomic number new elements the quest for new elements is usually described using atomic numbers as of year all elements with atomic numbers 1 to 118 have been observed synthesis of new elements is accomplished by bombarding target atoms of heavy elements with ions such that the sum of the atomic numbers of the target and ion elements equals the atomic number of the element being created in general the halflife of a nuclide becomes shorter as atomic number increasesjanuary 2022 though undiscovered nuclides with certain magic numbers of protons and neutrons may have relatively longer halflives and comprise an island of stability a hypothetical element composed only of neutrons has also been proposed and would have atomic number 0 but has never been observed see also references anatomy categories anatomy anatomical terminology branches of biology morphology biology anatomy grc is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts anatomy is a branch of natural science that deals with the structural organization of living things it is an old science having its beginnings in prehistoric times anatomy is inherently tied to developmental biology embryology comparative anatomy evolutionary biology and phylogeny as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated both over immediate and longterm timescales anatomy and physiology which study the structure and function of organisms and their parts respectively make a natural pair of related disciplines and are often studied together human anatomy is one of the essential basic sciences that are applied in medicine and is often studied alongside physiology anatomy is a complex and dynamic field that is constantly evolving as new discoveries are made in recent years there has been a significant increase in the use of advanced imaging techniques such as mri and ct scans which allow for more detailed and accurate visualizations of the bodys structures the discipline of anatomy is divided into macroscopic and microscopic parts macroscopic anatomy or gross anatomy is the examination of an animals body parts using unaided eyesight gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the tissues of various structures known as histology and also in the study of cells the history of anatomy is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body methods have also improved dramatically advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers corpses to 20thcentury medical imaging techniques including xray ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging etymology and definition derived from the greek ἀνατομή anatomē dissection from ἀνατέμνω anatémnō i cut up cut open from ἀνά aná up and τέμνω témnō i cut anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of organisms including their systems organs and tissues it includes the appearance and position of the various parts the materials from which they are composed and their relationships with other parts anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved for example an anatomist is concerned with the shape size position structure blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver while a physiologist is interested in the production of bile the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions the discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches including gross or macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy the study by sight of the external body features microscopic anatomy is the study of structures on a microscopic scale along with histology the study of tissues and embryology the study of an organism in its immature condition regional anatomy is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region such as the abdomen in contrast systemic anatomy is the study of the structures that make up a discrete body systemthat is a group of structures that work together to perform a unique body function such as the digestive system anatomy can be studied using both invasive and noninvasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems methods used include dissection in which a body is opened and its organs studied and endoscopy in which a video cameraequipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures angiography using xrays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels the term anatomy is commonly taken to refer to human anatomy however substantially similar structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals the term zootomy is also sometimes used to specifically refer to nonhuman animals the structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in plant anatomy animal tissues the kingdom animalia contains multicellular organisms that are heterotrophic and motile although some have secondarily adopted a sessile lifestyle most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these animals are also known as eumetazoans they have an internal digestive chamber with one or two openings the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development metazoans do not include the sponges which have undifferentiated cells unlike plant cells animal cells have neither a cell wall nor chloroplasts vacuoles when present are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell the body tissues are composed of numerous types of cells including those found in muscles nerves and skin each typically has a cell membrane formed of phospholipids cytoplasm and a nucleus all of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic germ layers those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called diploblastic and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called triploblastic all of a triploblastic animals tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo the ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types connective epithelial muscle and nervous tissue connective tissue connective tissues are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place the main types are loose connective tissue adipose tissue fibrous connective tissue cartilage and bone the extracellular matrix contains proteins the chief and most abundant of which is collagen collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues the matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body an exoskeleton is a thickened rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization as in crustaceans or by the crosslinking of its proteins as in insects an endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals as well as in many of those less developed epithelium epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules with little intercellular space epithelial cells can be squamous flat cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina the upper layer of the basement membrane the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells there are many different types of epithelium modified to suit a particular function in the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body keratinocytes make up to 95 of the cells in the skin the epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle in simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins in more advanced animals many glands are formed of epithelial cells muscle tissue muscle cells myocytes form the active contractile tissue of the body muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion either locomotion or movement within internal organs muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types smooth muscle skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically it contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths it is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension it is found in the movement of appendages and jaws obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two the filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions in higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus bladder intestines stomach oesophagus respiratory airways and blood vessels cardiac muscle is found only in the heart allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body nervous tissue nervous tissue is composed of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information in some slowmoving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians including sea anemones and jellyfish the nerves form a nerve net but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles in simple animals receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus in more complex animals specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks to other parts of the organism neurons can be connected together in ganglia in higher animals specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system brain and spinal cord and a peripheral nervous system the latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs the peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle certain glands and internal organs including the stomach vertebrate anatomy all vertebrates have a similar basic body plan and at some point in their lives mostly in the embryonic stage share the major chordate characteristics a stiffening rod the notochord a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material the neural tube pharyngeal arches and a tail posterior to the anus the spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm connective tissues are derived from mesoderm and gut is derived from the endoderm at the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut the mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal and the anus at the base of the tail the defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae in most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs however a few vertebrates such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages fins or legs which may be secondarily lost the limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor this is one of the arguments put forward by charles darwin to support his theory of evolution fish anatomy the body of a fish is divided into a head trunk and tail although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible the skeleton which forms the support structure inside the fish is either made of cartilage in cartilaginous fish or bone in bony fish the main skeletal element is the vertebral column composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong the ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles the main external features of the fish the fins are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays which with the exception of the caudal fins have no direct connection with the spine they are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk the heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop the eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision there is an inner ear but no external or middle ear low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure sharks and rays are basal fish with numerous primitive anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish including skeletons composed of cartilage their bodies tend to be dorsoventrally flattened they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head the dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales they have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open but not a swim bladder cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large yolky eggs some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases the bony fish lineage shows more derived anatomical traits often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish they have a bony skeleton are generally laterally flattened have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout the dermis is covered with overlapping scales bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column but not a cloaca they mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column amphibian anatomy amphibians are a class of animals comprising frogs salamanders and caecilians they are tetrapods but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have articular processes their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae their skulls are mostly broad and short and are often incompletely ossified their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales but contains many mucous glands and in some species poison glands the hearts of amphibians have three chambers two atria and one ventricle they have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist in frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs the feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing frogs have large eyes and no tail salamanders resemble lizards in appearance their short legs project sideways the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless they burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side reptile anatomy reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles tuataras lizards snakes and crocodiles they are tetrapods but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians the teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size the surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls the heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams the reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization with a copulatory organ present in most species the eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land or develop internally in some species the bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid turtles are notable for their protective shells they have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below these are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine the neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp horny plates in aquatic species the front legs are modified into flippers tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the triassic period there is one living species sphenodon punctatus the skull has two openings fenestrae on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull there is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews the teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down the brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi the tuatara has a welldeveloped parietal eye on its forehead lizards have skulls with only one fenestra on each side the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost this results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider lizards are mostly quadrupeds with the trunk held off the ground by short sidewaysfacing legs but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes lizards have moveable eyelids eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye snakes are closely related to lizards having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the cretaceous period and they share many of the same features the skeleton consists of a skull a hyoid bone spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of pelvic spurs the bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole snakes lack moveable eyelids the eyes being covered by transparent spectacle scales they do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warmblooded prey crocodilians are large lowslung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth the head and trunk are dorsoventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed it undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming the tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull the nostrils eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged unlike other reptiles crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood bird anatomy birds are tetrapods but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight birds are endothermic have a high metabolic rate a light skeletal system and powerful muscles the long bones are thin hollow and very light air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones the sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused there are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horncovered beak the eyes are relatively large particularly in nocturnal species such as owls they face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks the feathers are outgrowths of the epidermis and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail contour feathers cover the birds surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds the only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near the base of the tail this produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens there are scales on the legs feet and claws on the tips of the toes mammal anatomy mammals are a diverse class of animals mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight they mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings the legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk which is held well clear of the ground the bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth which are usually differentiated are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel the teeth are shed once milk teeth during the animals lifetime or not at all as is the case in cetaceans mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear they are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands producing milk to feed the young mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs the mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea mammals are amniotes and most are viviparous giving birth to live young exceptions to this are the egglaying monotremes the platypus and the echidnas of australia most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment but in marsupials the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mothers pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development human anatomy humans have the overall body plan of a mammal humans have a head neck trunk which includes the thorax and abdomen two arms and hands and two legs and feet generally students of certain biological sciences paramedics prosthetists and orthotists physiotherapists occupational therapists nurses podiatrists and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models skeletons textbooks diagrams photographs lectures and tutorials and in addition medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers the study of microscopic anatomy or histology can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations or slides under a microscope human anatomy physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically that is respectively studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest or studying by specific systems such as the nervous or respiratory systems the major anatomy textbook grays anatomy has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format in line with modern teaching methods a thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties such as histopathology and radiology academic anatomists are usually employed by universities medical schools or teaching hospitals they are often involved in teaching anatomy and research into certain systems organs tissues or cells invertebrate anatomy invertebrates constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as paramecium to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus lobster and dragonfly they constitute about 95 of the animal species by definition none of these creatures has a backbone the cells of singlecell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia food may be gathered by phagocytosis energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton some protozoans can form multicellular colonies metazoans are a multicellular organism with different groups of cells serving different functions the most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates the outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism an endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms sponges and some cephalopods exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods insects spiders ticks shrimps crabs lobsters calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs brachiopods and some tubebuilding polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians polyps sea anemones jellyfish and the collagenous cuticle of annelids the outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells gland cells and stinging cells there may also be protrusions such as microvilli cilia bristles spines and tubercles marcello malpighi the father of microscopical anatomy discovered that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm he observed that when a ringlike portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves and being captured above the ring arthropod anatomy arthropods comprise the largest phylum of invertebrates in the animal kingdom with over a million known species insects possess segmented bodies supported by a hardjointed outer covering the exoskeleton made mostly of chitin the segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts a head a thorax and an abdomen the head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae a pair of compound eyes one to three simple eyes ocelli and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts the thorax has three pairs of segmented legs one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of wings the abdomen is composed of eleven segments some of which may be fused and houses the digestive respiratory excretory and reproductive systems there is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts especially wings legs antennae and mouthparts spiders a class of arachnids have four pairs of legs a body of two segmentsa cephalothorax and an abdomen spiders have no wings and no antennae they have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous they have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax these have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs at the end of each male pedipalp is a spoonshaped cymbium that acts to support the copulatory organ other branches of anatomy history ancient in 1600 bce the edwin smith papyrus an ancient egyptian medical text described the heart and its vessels as well as the brain and its meninges and cerebrospinal fluid and the liver spleen kidneys uterus and bladder and it showed the blood vessels diverging from the heart the ebers papyrus 1550 bce features a treatise on the heart with vessels carrying all the bodys fluids to or from every member of the body ancient greek anatomy and physiology underwent great changes and advances throughout the early medieval world over time this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made which have contributed towards the understanding of the brain eye liver reproductive organs and the nervous system the hellenistic egyptian city of alexandria was the steppingstone for greek anatomy and physiology alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the greeks but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers great patronage of the arts and sciences from the ptolemaic dynasty of egypt helped raise alexandria up further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other greek states some of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in hellenistic alexandria two of the most famous anatomists and physiologists of the third century were herophilus and erasistratus these two physicians helped pioneer human dissection for medical research using the cadavers of condemned criminals which was considered taboo until the renaissanceherophilus was recognized as the first person to perform systematic dissections herophilus became known for his anatomical works making impressing contributions to many branches of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine some of the works included classifying the system of the pulse the discovery that human arteries had thicker walls than veins and that the atria were parts of the heart herophiluss knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain eye liver reproductive organs and nervous system and characterizing the course of disease erasistratus accurately described the structure of the brain including the cavities and membranes and made a distinction between its cerebrum and cerebellum during his study in alexandria erasistratus was particularly concerned with studies of the circulatory and nervous systems he was able to distinguish the sensory and the motor nerves in the human body and believed that air entered the lungs and heart which was then carried throughout the body his distinction between the arteries and veinsthe arteries carrying the air through the body while the veins carried the blood from the heart was a great anatomical discovery erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the valves of the heart including the tricuspid during the third century greek physicians were able to differentiate nerves from blood vessels and tendons and to realize that the nerves convey neural impulses it was herophilus who made the point that damage to motor nerves induced paralysis herophilus named the meninges and ventricles in the brain appreciated the division between cerebellum and cerebrum and recognized that the brain was the seat of intellect and not a cooling chamber as propounded by aristotle herophilus is also credited with describing the optic oculomotor motor division of the trigeminal facial vestibulocochlear and hypoglossal nerves great feats were made during the third century bce in both the digestive and reproductive systems herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands but the small intestine and liver he showed that the uterus is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes he recognized that spermatozoa were produced by the testes and was the first to identify the prostate gland the anatomy of the muscles and skeleton is described in the hippocratic corpus an ancient greek medical work written by unknown authors aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection praxagoras identified the difference between arteries and veins also in the 4th century bce herophilos and erasistratus produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on vivisection of criminals in alexandria during the ptolemaic period in the 2nd century galen of pergamum an anatomist clinician writer and philosopher wrote the final and highly influential anatomy treatise of ancient times he compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through dissection of animals he was one of the first experimental physiologists through his vivisection experiments on animals galens drawings based mostly on dog anatomy became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years his work was known to renaissance doctors only through islamic golden age medicine until it was translated from the greek some time in the 15th century medieval to early modern anatomy developed little from classical times until the sixteenth century as the historian marie boas writes progress in anatomy before the sixteenth century is as mysteriously slow as its development after 1500 is startlingly rapid120121 between 1275 and 1326 the anatomists mondino de luzzi alessandro achillini and antonio benivieni at bologna carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times mondinos anatomy of 1316 was the first textbook in the medieval rediscovery of human anatomy it describes the body in the order followed in mondinos dissections starting with the abdomen then the thorax then the head and limbs it was the standard anatomy textbook for the next century leonardo da vinci 14521519 was trained in anatomy by andrea del verrocchio he made use of his anatomical knowledge in his artwork making many sketches of skeletal structures muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected andreas vesalius 15141564 professor of anatomy at the university of padua is considered the founder of modern human anatomy originally from brabant vesalius published the influential book de humani corporis fabrica the structure of the human body a large format book in seven volumes in 1543 the accurate and intricately detailed illustrations often in allegorical poses against italianate landscapes are thought to have been made by the artist jan van calcar a pupil of titian in england anatomy was the subject of the first public lectures given in any science these were given by the company of barbers and surgeons in the 16th century joined in 1583 by the lumleian lectures in surgery at the royal college of physicians late modern in the united states medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the 18th century classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain philadelphia baltimore and new york were all renowned for body snatching activity as criminals raided graveyards at night removing newly buried corpses from their coffins a similar problem existed in britain where demand for bodies became so great that graveraiding and even anatomy murder were practised to obtain cadavers some graveyards were in consequence protected with watchtowers the practice was halted in britain by the anatomy act of 1832 while in the united states similar legislation was enacted after the physician william s forbes of jefferson medical college was found guilty in 1882 of complicity with resurrectionists in the despoliation of graves in lebanon cemetery the teaching of anatomy in britain was transformed by sir john struthers regius professor of anatomy at the university of aberdeen from 1863 to 1889 he was responsible for setting up the system of three years of preclinical academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine including especially anatomy this system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003 as well as teaching he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of comparative anatomy published over 70 research papers and became famous for his public dissection of the tay whale from 1822 the royal college of surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools medical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy and were often used in teaching ignaz semmelweis investigated puerperal fever and he discovered how it was caused he noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives the students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically before the modern medical era the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were dissection of the dead and inspection palpation and auscultation of the living it was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839 matthias jakob schleiden and theodor schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens the invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them about the same time in the 1950s the use of xray diffraction for studying the crystal structures of proteins nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy equally important advances have occurred in noninvasive techniques for examining the interior structures of the body xrays can be passed through the body and used in medical radiography and fluoroscopy to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness magnetic resonance imaging computed tomography and ultrasound imaging have all enabled examination of internal structures in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations see also references external links sources affirming the consequent categories logic articles needing expert attention formal fallacies in propositional logic affirming the consequent sometimes called converse error fallacy of the converse or confusion of necessity and sufficiency is a formal fallacy of taking a true conditional statement eg if the lamp were broken then the room would be dark under certain assumptions there are no other lights in the room it is nighttime and the windows are closed and invalidly inferring its converse the room is dark so the lamp must be broken even though that statement may not be true under the same assumptions this arises when the consequent the room would be dark has other possible antecedents for example the lamp is in working order but is switched off or there is no lamp in the room converse errors are common in everyday thinking and communication and can result from among other causes communication issues misconceptions about logic and failure to consider other causes the opposite statement denying the consequent is called modus tollens and is a valid form of argument formal description the root cause of such a logical error is sometimes failure to realize that just because p is a possible condition for q p may not be the only condition for q ie q may follow from another condition as well of the possible forms of mixed hypothetical syllogisms two are valid and two are invalid affirming the antecedent modus ponens and denying the consequent modus tollens are valid affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent are invalid additional examples example 1 one way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample with true premises but an obviously false conclusion for example there are many places to live in california other than san diego on the other hand one can affirm with certainty that if someone does not live in california nonq then this person does not live in san diego nonp this is the contrapositive of the first statement and it must be true if and only if the original statement is true example 2 here it is immediately intuitive that any number of other antecedents if an animal is a deer if an animal is an elephant if an animal is a moose etc can give rise to the consequent then it has four legs and that it is preposterous to suppose that having four legs must imply that the animal is a dog and nothing else this is useful as a teaching example since most people can immediately recognize that the conclusion reached must be wrong intuitively a cat cannot be a dog and that the method by which it was reached must therefore be fallacious example 3 in catch22 the chaplain is interrogated for supposedly being washington irvingirving washington who has been blocking out large portions of soldiers letters home the colonel has found such a letter but with the chaplains name signed p in this case is the chaplain signs his own name and q the chaplains name is written the chaplains name may be written but he did not necessarily write it as the colonel falsely concludes see also references andrei tarkovsky categories andrei tarkovsky 1932 births 1986 deaths 20thcentury

considered one of the greatest and most influential directors in cinema history tarkovskys films explore spiritual and metaphysical themes and are noted for their slow pacing and long takes dreamlike visual imagery and preoccupation with nature and memory tarkovsky studied film at moscows vgik under filmmaker mikhail romm and subsequently directed his first five features in the soviet union ivans childhood 1962 andrei rublev 1966 solaris 1972 mirror 1975 and stalker 1979 a number of his films from this period are ranked among the best films ever made after years of creative conflict with state film authorities tarkovsky left the country in 1979 and made his final two films abroad nostalghia 1983 and the sacrifice 1986 were produced in italy and sweden respectively in 1986 he also published a book about cinema and art entitled sculpting in time he died later that year of cancer a condition possibly caused by the toxic locations used in the filming of stalker tarkovsky was the recipient of several awards at the cannes film festival throughout his career including the fipresci prize the prize of the ecumenical jury and the grand prix spécial du jury he was also awarded the golden lion at the venice film festival for his debut film ivans childhood in 1990 he was posthumously awarded the soviet unions prestigious lenin prize three of his filmsandrei rublev mirror and stalkerfeatured in sight  sounds 2012 poll of the 100 greatest films of all time life and career childhood and early life andrei tarkovsky was born in the village of zavrazhye in the yuryevetsky district of the ivanovo industrial oblast modernday kadyysky district of the kostroma oblast russia to the poet and translator arseny aleksandrovich tarkovsky a native of yelysavethrad now kropyvnytskyi ukraine and maria ivanova vishnyakova a graduate of the maxim gorky literature institute who later worked as a proofreader she was born in moscow in the dubasov family estate andreis paternal grandfather aleksandr karlovich tarkovsky in aleksander karol tarkowski was a polish nobleman who worked as a bank clerk his wife maria danilovna rachkovskaya was a romanian language teacher who arrived from iași andreis maternal grandmother vera nikolayevna vishnyakova née dubasova belonged to an old dubasov family of russian nobility that traces its history back to the 17th century among her relatives was admiral fyodor dubasov a fact she had to conceal during the soviet days she was married to ivan ivanovich vishnyakov a native of the kaluga governorate who studied law at the moscow state university and served as a judge in kozelsk according to the family legend tarkovskys ancestors on his fathers side were princes from the shamkhalate of tarki dagestan although his sister marina tarkovskaya who conducted detailed research on their genealogy called it a myth even a prank of sorts stressing that no document confirms this narrative tarkovsky spent his childhood in yuryevets he was described by childhood friends as active and popular having many friends and being typically in the center of action his father left the family in 1937 subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941 he returned home in 1943 having been awarded a red star after being shot in one of his legs which he would eventually need to amputate due to gangrene tarkovsky stayed with his mother moving with her and his sister marina to moscow where she worked as a proofreader at a printing press in 1939 tarkovsky enrolled at the moscow school no 554 during the war the three evacuated to yuryevets living with his maternal grandmother in 1943 the family returned to moscow tarkovsky continued his studies at his old school where the poet andrei voznesensky was one of his classmates he studied piano at a music school and attended classes at an art school the family lived on shchipok street in the zamoskvorechye district in moscow from november 1947 to spring 1948 he was in the hospital with tuberculosis many themes of his childhoodthe evacuation his mother and her two children the withdrawn father the time in the hospitalfeature prominently in his film mirror in his school years tarkovsky was a troublemaker and a poor student he still managed to graduate and from 1951 to 1952 studied arabic at the oriental institute in moscow a branch of the academy of sciences of the soviet union although he already spoke some arabic and was a successful student in his first semesters he did not finish his studies and dropped out to work as a prospector for the academy of science institute for nonferrous metals and gold he participated in a yearlong research expedition to the river kureyka near turukhansk in the krasnoyarsk province during this time in the taiga tarkovsky decided to study film film school student upon returning from the research expedition in 1954 tarkovsky applied at the state institute of cinematography vgik and was admitted to the filmdirecting program he was in the same class as irma raush irina whom he married in april 1957 the early khrushchev era offered good opportunities for young film directors before 1953 annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors after 1953 more films were produced many of them by young directors the khrushchev thaw relaxed soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of european and north american literature films and music this allowed tarkovsky to see films of the italian neorealists french new wave and of directors such as kurosawa buñuel bergman bresson wajda whose film ashes and diamonds influenced tarkovsky and mizoguchi tarkovskys teacher and mentor was mikhail romm who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors in 1956 tarkovsky directed his first student short film the killers from a short story of ernest hemingway the longer television film there will be no leave today followed in 1959 both films were a collaboration between the vgik students classmate aleksandr gordon who married tarkovskys sister in particular directed wrote edited and acted in the two films with tarkovsky an important influence on tarkovsky was the film director grigory chukhray who was teaching at the vgik impressed by the talent of his student chukhray offered tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film clear skies tarkovsky initially showed interest but then decided to concentrate on his studies and his own projects during his third year at the vgik tarkovsky met andrei konchalovsky they found much in common as they liked the same film directors and shared ideas on cinema and films in 1959 they wrote the script antarctica  distant country which was later published in the moskovsky komsomolets tarkovsky submitted the script to lenfilm but it was rejected they were more successful with the script the steamroller and the violin which they sold to mosfilm this became tarkovskys graduation project earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning first prize at the new york student film festival in 1961 film career in the soviet union tarkovskys first feature film was ivans childhood in 1962 he had inherited the film from director eduard abalov who had to abort the project the film earned tarkovsky international acclaim and won the golden lion award at the venice film festival in the year 1962 in the same year on 30 september his first son arseny called senka in tarkovskys diaries tarkovsky was born in 1965 he directed the film andrei rublev about the life of andrei rublev the fifteenthcentury russian icon painter andrei rublev was not except for a single screening in moscow in 1966 immediately released after completion due to problems with soviet authorities tarkovsky had to cut the film several times resulting in several different versions of varying lengths the film was widely released in the soviet union in a cut version in 1971 nevertheless the film had a budget of more than 1 million rubles  a significant sum for that period a version of the film was presented at the cannes film festival in 1969 and won the fipresci prize he divorced his wife irina in june 1970 in the same year he married larisa kizilova née egorkina who had been a production assistant for the film andrei rublev they had been living together since 1965 their son andrei andreyevich tarkovsky nicknamed andriosha meaning little andre or andre junior was born in the same year on 7 august in 1972 he completed solaris an adaptation of the novel solaris by stanisław lem he had worked on this together with screenwriter friedrich gorenstein as early as 1968 the film was presented at the cannes film festival won the grand prix spécial du jury and was nominated for the palme dor from 1973 to 1974 he shot the film mirror a highly autobiographical and unconventionally structured film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his fathers poems in this film tarkovsky portrayed the plight of childhood affected by war tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967 under the consecutive titles confession white day and a white white day from the beginning the film was not well received by soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature soviet authorities placed the film in the third category a severely limited distribution and only allowed it to be shown in thirdclass cinemas and workers clubs few prints were made and the filmmakers received no returns third category films also placed the filmmakers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds which could have serious effects on their future productivity these difficulties are presumed to have made tarkovsky play with the idea of going abroad and producing a film outside the soviet film industry during 1975 tarkovsky also worked on the screenplay hoffmanniana about the german writer and poet e t a hoffmann in december 1976 he directed hamlet his only stage play at the lenkom theatre in moscow the main role was played by anatoly solonitsyn who also acted in several of tarkovskys films at the end of 1978 he also wrote the screenplay sardor together with the writer aleksandr misharin the last film tarkovsky completed in the soviet union was stalker inspired by the novel roadside picnic by the brothers arkady and boris strugatsky tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986 initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel dead mountaineers hotel and he developed a raw script influenced by a discussion with arkady strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on roadside picnic work on this film began in 1976 the production was mired in troubles improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots tarkovskys relationship with cinematographer georgy rerberg deteriorated to the point where he hired alexander knyazhinsky as a new first cinematographer furthermore tarkovsky had a heart attack in april 1978 resulting in further delay the film was completed in 1979 and won the prize of the ecumenical jury at the cannes film festival in a question and answer session at the edinburgh filmhouse on 11 february 1981 tarkovsky trenchantly rejected suggestions that the film was either impenetrably mysterious or a political allegory in 1979 tarkovsky began production of the film the first day russian первый день pervyj dyen based on a script by his friend and longterm collaborator andrei konchalovsky the film was set in 18thcentury russia during the reign of peter the great and starred natalya bondarchuk and anatoli papanov to get the project approved by goskino tarkovsky submitted a script that was different from the original script omitting several scenes that were critical of the official atheism in the soviet union after shooting roughly half of the film the project was stopped by goskino after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the censors tarkovsky was reportedly infuriated by this interruption and destroyed most of the film film career outside the soviet union during the summer of 1979 tarkovsky traveled to italy where he shot the documentary voyage in time together with his longtime friend tonino guerra tarkovsky returned to italy in 1980 for an extended trip during which he and guerra completed the script for the film nostalghia during this period he took polaroid photographs depicting his personal life tarkovsky returned to italy in 1982 to start shooting nostalghia but mosfilm then withdrew from the project so he sought and received financial backing from the italian rai tarkovsky completed the film in 1983 and it was presented at the cannes film festival where it won the fipresci prize and the prize of the ecumenical jury tarkovsky also shared a special prize called grand prix du cinéma de création with robert bresson soviet authorities lobbied to prevent the film from winning the palme dor a fact that hardened tarkovskys resolve to never work in the soviet union again after cannes he went to london to stage and choreograph the opera boris godunov at the royal opera house under the musical direction of claudio abbado at a press conference in milan on 10 july 1984 he announced that he would never return to the soviet union and would remain in western europe he stated i am not a soviet dissident i have no conflict with the soviet government but if he returned home he added i would be unemployed at that time his son andriosha was still in the soviet union and not allowed to leave the country on 28 august 1985 tarkovsky was processed as a soviet defector at a refugee camp in latina italy registered with the serial number 13225379 and officially welcomed to the west tarkovsky spent most of 1984 preparing the film the sacrifice it was finally shot in 1985 in sweden with many of the crew being alumni from ingmar bergmans films including cinematographer sven nykvist tarkovskys vision of his film was greatly influenced by bergmans style while the sacrifice is about an apocalypse and impending death faith and possible redemption in the makingof documentary directed by andrei tarkovsky in a particularly poignant scene writerdirector michal leszczylowski follows tarkovsky on a walk as he expresses his sentiments on deathhe claims himself to be immortal and has no fear of dying ironically at the end of the year tarkovsky was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in january 1986 he began treatment in paris and was joined there by his son andre jr who was finally allowed to leave the soviet union what would be tarkovskys final film was dedicated to him the sacrifice was presented at the cannes film festival and received the grand prix spécial du jury the fipresci prize and the prize of the ecumenical jury as tarkovsky was unable to attend due to his illness the prizes were collected by his son death in tarkovskys last diary entry 15 december 1986 he wrote but now i have no strength leftthat is the problem the diaries are sometimes also known as martyrology and were published posthumously in 1989 and in english in 1991 tarkovsky died in paris on 29 december 1986 his funeral ceremony was held at the alexander nevsky cathedral he was buried on 3 january 1987 in the russian cemetery in saintegenevièvedesbois in france the inscription on his gravestone which was erected in 1994 was conceived by tarkovskys wife larisa reads to the man who saw the angel larisa died in 1998 and is buried beside her husband a conspiracy theory emerged in russia in the early 1990s when it was alleged that tarkovsky did not die of natural causes but was assassinated by the kgb evidence for this hypothesis includes testimonies by former kgb agents who claim that viktor chebrikov gave the order to eradicate tarkovsky to curtail what the soviet government and the kgb saw as antisoviet propaganda by tarkovsky other evidence includes several memoranda that surfaced after the 1991 coup and the claim by one of tarkovskys doctors that his cancer could not have developed from a natural cause tarkovsky his wife larisa and actor anatoly solonitsyn all died from the same type of cancer vladimir sharun a sound designer for stalker was convinced that all three died due to exposure to chemicals released from a chemical plant upstream from where the film was shot influences and thoughts on film tarkovsky became a film director during the mid and late 1950s a period referred to as the khrushchev thaw during which soviet society opened to foreign films literature and music among other things this allowed tarkovsky to see films of european american and japanese directors an experience that influenced his own film making his teacher and mentor at the film school mikhail romm allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director tarkovsky was according to fellow student shavkat abdusalmov fascinated by japanese films he was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight tarkovsky has also expressed interest in the art of haiku and its ability to create images in such a way that they mean nothing beyond themselves tarkovsky was also a deeply religious orthodox christian who believed great art should have a higher spiritual purpose he was a perfectionist not given to humor or humility his signature style was ponderous and literary having many characters that pondered over religious themes and issues regarding faith tarkovsky perceived that the art of cinema has only been truly mastered by very few filmmakers stating in a 1970 interview with naum abramov that they can be counted on the fingers of one hand in 1972 tarkovsky told film historian leonid kozlov his ten favorite films the list is as follows diary of a country priest and mouchette by robert bresson winter light wild strawberries and persona by ingmar bergman nazarín by luis buñuel city lights by charlie chaplin ugetsu by kenji mizoguchi seven samurai by akira kurosawa and woman in the dunes by hiroshi teshigahara he also liked pier paolo pasolinis film the gospel according to st matthew among his favorite directors were buñuel mizoguchi bergman bresson kurosawa michelangelo antonioni jean vigo and carl theodor dreyer with the exception of city lights the list does not contain any films of the early silent era the reason is that tarkovsky saw film as an art as only a relatively recent phenomenon with the early filmmaking forming only a prelude the list has also no films or directors from tarkovskys native russia although he rated soviet directors such as boris barnet sergei parajanov and alexander dovzhenko highly he said of dovzhenkos earth i have lived a lot among very simple farmers and met extraordinary people they spread calmness had such tact they conveyed a feeling of dignity and displayed wisdom that i have seldom come across on such a scale dovzhenko had obviously understood wherein the sense of life resides  this trespassing of the border between nature and mankind is an ideal place for the existence of man dovzhenko understood this he was also not a fan of blockbusters or science fiction largely dismissing the latter for its comic book trappings and vulgar commercialism however in notable exceptions tarkovsky praised the james cameron blockbuster film the terminator saying that its vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art he was critical of the brutality and low acting skills but was nevertheless impressed by the film he equally liked george lucass star wars according to his son andrei a tarkovsky cinematic style in a 1962 interview tarkovsky argued all art of course is intellectual but for me all the arts and cinema even more so must above all be emotional and act upon the heart his films are characterized by metaphysical themes extremely long takes and images often considered by critics to be of exceptional beauty recurring motifs are dreams memory childhood running water accompanied by fire rain indoors reflections levitation and characters reappearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera he once said juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away relating a person to the whole world that is the meaning of cinema tarkovsky incorporated levitation scenes into several of his films most notably solaris to him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photogenic value and magical inexplicability water clouds and reflections were used by him for their surreal beauty and photogenic value as well as their symbolism such as waves or the forms of brooks or running water bells and candles are also frequent symbols these are symbols of film sight and sound and tarkovskys film frequently has themes of selfreflection tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called sculpting in time by this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it unedited movie footage transcribes time in real time by using long takes and few cuts in his films he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing time lost and the relationship of one moment in time to another up to and including his film mirror tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory after mirror he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the dramatic unities proposed by aristotle a concentrated action happening in one place within the span of a single day several of tarkovskys films have color or blackandwhite sequences this first occurs in the otherwise monochrome andrei rublev which features a color epilogue of rublevs authentic religious icon paintings all of his films afterwards contain monochrome and in stalkers case sepia sequences while otherwise being in color in 1966 in an interview conducted shortly after finishing andrei rublev tarkovsky dismissed color film as a commercial gimmick and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color he claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments but not all the time as this distracts the viewer to him films in color were like moving paintings or photographs which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life director ingmar bergman commented on tarkovsky contrarily however bergman conceded the truth in the claim made by a critic who wrote that with autumn sonata bergman does bergman adding tarkovsky began to make tarkovsky films and that fellini began to make fellini films  buñuel nearly always made buñuel films this pastiche of ones own work has been derogatorily termed as selfkaraoke vadim yusov tarkovsky worked in close collaboration with cinematographer vadim yusov from 1958 to 1972 and much of the visual style of tarkovskys films can be attributed to this collaboration tarkovsky would spend two days preparing for yusov to film a single long take and due to the preparation usually only a single take was needed sven nykvist in his last film the sacrifice tarkovsky worked with cinematographer sven nykvist who had worked on many films with director ingmar bergman nykvist was not alone several people involved in the production had previously collaborated with bergman notably lead actor erland josephson who had also acted for tarkovsky in nostalghia nykvist complained that tarkovsky would frequently look through the camera and even direct actors through it but ultimately stated that choosing to work with tarkovsky was one of the best choices he had ever made filmography tarkovsky is mainly known as a film director during his career he directed seven feature films as well as three shorts from his time at vgik his features are he also wrote several screenplays furthermore he directed the play hamlet for the stage in moscow directed the opera boris godunov in london and he directed a radio production of the short story turnabout by william faulkner he also wrote sculpting in time a book on film theory tarkovskys first feature film was ivans childhood in 1962 he then directed andrei rublev in 1966 solaris in 1972 mirror in 1975 and stalker in 1979 the documentary voyage in time was produced in italy in 1982 as was nostalghia in 1983 his last film the sacrifice was produced in sweden in 1986 tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films sometimes with a cowriter tarkovsky once said that a director who realizes somebody elses screenplay without being involved in it becomes a mere illustrator resulting in dead and monotonous films publications  unproduced screenplays concentrate concentrate концентрат kontsentrat is a neverfilmed 1958 screenplay by tarkovsky the screenplay is based on tarkovskys year in the taiga as a member of a research expedition prior to his enrollment in film school its about the leader of a geological expedition who waits for the boat that brings back the concentrates collected by the expedition the expedition is surrounded by mystery and its purpose is a state secret although some authors claim that the screenplay was filmed according to marina tarkovskaya tarkovskys sister and wife of aleksandr gordon a fellow student of tarkovsky during his film school years the screenplay was never filmed tarkovsky wrote the screenplay during his entrance examination at the state institute of cinematography vgik in a single sitting he earned the highest possible grade excellent отлично for this work in 1994 fragments of concentrate were filmed and used in the documentary andrei tarkovskys taiga summer by marina tarkovskaya and aleksandr gordon hoffmanniana hoffmanniana гофманиана is a neverfilmed 1974 screenplay by tarkovsky the screenplay is based on the life and work of german author e t a hoffmann in 1974 an acquaintance from tallinnfilm approached tarkovsky to write a screenplay on a german theme tarkovsky considered thomas mann and e t a hoffmann and also thought about ibsens peer gynt in the end tarkovsky signed a contract for a script based on the life and work of hoffmann he planned to write the script during the summer of 1974 at his dacha writing was not without difficulty less than a month before the deadline he had not written a single page he finally finished the project in late 1974 and submitted the final script to tallinnfilm in october although the script was well received by the officials at tallinnfilm it was the consensus that no one but tarkovsky would be able to direct it the script was sent to goskino in february 1976 and although approval was granted for proceeding with making the film the screenplay was never realized in 1984 during the time of his exile in the west tarkovsky revisited the screenplay and made a few changes he also considered to finally direct a film based on the screenplay but ultimately dropped this idea films about tarkovsky awards and commemoration numerous awards were bestowed on tarkovsky throughout his lifetime under the influence of glasnost and perestroika tarkovsky was finally recognized in the soviet union in the autumn of 1986 shortly before his death by a retrospective of his films in moscow after his death an entire issue of the film magazine iskusstvo kino was devoted to tarkovsky in their obituaries the film committee of the council of ministers of the soviet union and the union of soviet film makers expressed their sorrow that tarkovsky had to spend the last years of his life in exile posthumously he was awarded the lenin prize in 1990 one of the highest state honors in the soviet union in 1989 the andrei tarkovsky memorial prize was established with its first recipient being the russian animator yuri norstein in three consecutive events the moscow international film festival awarded the andrei tarkovsky award in 1993 1995 and 1997 in 1996 the andrei tarkovsky museum opened in yuryevets his childhood town a minor planet 3345 tarkovskij discovered by soviet astronomer lyudmila karachkina in 1982 has been named after him tarkovsky has been the subject of several documentaries most notable is the 1988 documentary moscow elegy by russian film director alexander sokurov sokurovs own work has been heavily influenced by tarkovsky the film consists mostly of narration over stock footage from tarkovskys films directed by andrei tarkovsky is a 1988 documentary film by michal leszczylowski an editor of the film the sacrifice film director chris marker produced the television documentary one day in the life of andrei arsenevich as an homage to andrei tarkovsky in 2000 at the entrance to the gerasimov institute of cinematography in moscow there is a monument that includes statues of tarkovsky gennady shpalikov and vasily shukshin reception and legacy andrei tarkovsky and his works have received praise from many filmmakers critics and thinkers the swedish filmmaker ingmar bergman was quoted as saying tarkovsky for me is the greatest us all the one who invented a new language true to the nature of film as it captures life as a reflection life as a dream the japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa remarked on tarkovskys films as saying his unusual sensitivity is both overwhelming and astounding it almost reaches a pathological intensity probably there is no equal among film directors alive now kurosawa also commented i love all of tarkovskys films i love his personality and all his works every cut from his films is a marvelous image in itself but the finished image is nothing more than the imperfect accomplishment of his idea his ideas are only realized in part and he had to make do with it the iranian filmmaker abbas kiarostami remarked that tarkovskys works separate me completely from physical life and are the most spiritual films i have seen the polish filmmaker krzysztof kieślowski commented that andrei tarkovsky was one of the greatest directors of recent years and regarded tarkovskys film ivans childhood as an influence on his own work the turkish filmmaker nuri bilge ceylan said that when he first discovered the films of andrei tarkovsky as a college student unsure of what he wanted to do with his life he was utterly baffled by the lauded russian master he walked out of a screening of solaris at the halfway point and stopped a vhs tape of mirror at a similar juncture today he considers the latter to be the greatest film ever made ive seen it maybe 20 times he says the armenian filmmaker sergei parajanov remarked that watching tarkovskys film ivans childhood was his main inspiration to become a filmmaker by saying i did not know how to do anything and i would not have done anything if there had not been ivans childhood the austrian filmmaker michael haneke voted for mirror on his top 10 films in the 2002 sight  sound directors poll and later said that he has seen the picture at least 25 times the american filmmaker stan brakhage said that i personally think that the three greatest tasks for film in the 20th century are 1 to make the epic that is to tell the tales of the tribes of the world 2 to keep it personal because only in the eccentricities of our personal lives do we have any chances at the truth 3 to do the dream work that is to illuminate the borders of the unconscious the only filmmaker i know that does all these three things equally in every film he makes is andrei tarkovsky and thats why i think hes the greatest living narrative filmmaker the german filmmaker wim wenders dedicated his film wings of desire to tarkovsky along with françois truffaut and yasujirō ozu the french filmmaker chris marker directed a documentary film as a homage to tarkovsky called one day in the life of andrei arsenevich and used tarkovskys concept of the zone from the film stalker for his 1983 film essay sans soleil the greek filmmaker theo angelopoulos regarded tarkovskys film stalker as one of the films that influenced him the polish filmmaker andrzej żuławski remarked that if anybody influenced anybody its me being influenced by tarkovsky not the reverse and called tarkovskys film andrei rublev a masterpiece the greekaustralian filmmaker alex proyas was extremely influenced by tarkovskys work and cited stalker as one of his favorite films the french philosopher jeanpaul sartre highly praised tarkovskys film ivans childhood saying that it was one of the most beautiful films he had ever seen the japanese anime filmmaker mamoru oshii known for his works such as ghost in the shell was influenced by tarkovsky the indianborn british american novelist salman rushdie praised tarkovsky and his work solaris by calling it a scifi masterpiece film historian steven dillon says that much of subsequent film was deeply influenced by the films of tarkovsky mexican filmmaker alejandro gonzález iñarritu is a huge fan of tarkovsky he once said in an interview andrei rublev is maybe my favorite film ever and in another interview he added i remember the first time i saw a tarkovsky film i was shocked by it i did not know what to do i was shocked by it i was fascinated because suddenly i realized that film could have so many more layers to it than what i had imagined before there are many direct references and hidden tributes to tarkovskys movies in iñarritus 2015 oscarwinning drama the revenant danish film director lars von trier is a fervent admirer of tarkovsky he dedicated his 2009 film antichrist to him and while discussing it with critic david jenkins asked have you seen mirror i was hypnotised ive seen it 20 times its the closest thing ive got to a religion  to me he is a god the japanese composer ryuichi sakamoto was an admirer of tarkovskys work describing his penultimate solo album async as a soundtrack for an imaginary tarkovsky film on tarkovskys overall influence on his own work sakamoto stated as ive been making music and trying to go deeper and deeper i was finally able to understand what the tarkovsky movies are about  how symphonic they are  its almost music not just the sounds  its a symphony of moving images and sounds they are more complex than music film festival two film festivals have been named in his honor see also references notes bibliography further reading external links ambiguity categories ambiguity semantics mathematical notation concepts in epistemology barriers to critical thinking formal semantics natural language ambiguity is the type of meaning in which a phrase statement or resolution is not explicitly defined making for several interpretations others describe it as a concept or statement that has no real reference a common aspect of ambiguity is uncertainty it is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose intended meaning cannot be definitively resolved according to a rule or process with a finite number of steps the prefix ambi reflects the idea of two as in two meanings the concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with vagueness in ambiguity specific and distinct interpretations are permitted although some may not be immediately obvious whereas with vague information it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity linguistic forms lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity the former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful contextdependent interpretations the latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations none of which may have a standard agreedupon meaning this form of ambiguity is closely related to vagueness ambiguity in human language is argued to reflect principles of efficient communication languages that communicate efficiently will avoid sending information that is redundant with information provided in the context this can be shown mathematically to result in a system that is ambiguous when context is neglected in this way ambiguity is viewed as a generally useful feature of a linguistic system linguistic ambiguity can be a problem in law because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance lexical ambiguity the lexical ambiguity of a word or phrase applies to it having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs meaning here refers to whatever should be represented by a good dictionary for instance the word bank has several distinct lexical definitions including financial institution and edge of a river or consider apothecary one could say i bought herbs from the apothecary this could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary pharmacist or went to the apothecary pharmacy the context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it clearer which of the meanings is intended if for instance someone says i put 100 in the bank most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud however some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to make a used word clearer lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context a task referred to as wordsense disambiguation the use of multidefined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning in which case a less ambiguous term should have been used the goal of clear concise communication is that the receivers have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed an exception to this could include a politician whose weasel words and obfuscation are necessary to gain support from multiple constituents with mutually exclusive conflicting desires from his or her candidate of choice ambiguity is a powerful tool of political science more problematic are words whose multiple meanings express closely related concepts good for example can mean useful or functional thats a good hammer exemplary shes a good student pleasing this is good soup moral a good person versus the lesson to be learned from a story righteous etc i have a good daughter is not clear about which sense is intended the various ways to apply prefixes and suffixes can also create ambiguity unlockable can mean capable of being opened or impossible to lock semantic and syntactic ambiguity semantic ambiguity occurs when a word phrase or sentence taken out of context has more than one interpretation in we saw her duck example due to richard nordquist the words her duck can refer either syntactic ambiguity arises when a sentence can have two or more different meanings because of the structure of the sentenceits syntax this is often due to a modifying expression such as a prepositional phrase the application of which is unclear he ate the cookies on the couch for example could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch as opposed to those that were on the table or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies to get in you will need an entrance fee of 10 or your voucher and your drivers license this could mean that you need either ten dollars or both your voucher and your license or it could mean that you need your license and you need either ten dollars or a voucher only rewriting the sentence or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity for the notion of and theoretic results about syntactic ambiguity in artificial formal languages such as computer programming languages see ambiguous grammar usually semantic and syntactic ambiguity go hand in hand the sentence we saw her duck is also syntactically ambiguous conversely a sentence like he ate the cookies on the couch is also semantically ambiguous rarely but occasionally the different parsings of a syntactically ambiguous phrase result in the same meaning for example the command cook cook can be parsed as cook noun used as vocative cook imperative verb form but also as cook imperative verb form cook noun used as vocative it is more common that a syntactically unambiguous phrase has a semantic ambiguity for example the lexical ambiguity in your boss is a funny man is purely semantic leading to the response funny haha or funny peculiar spoken language can contain many more types of ambiguities that are called phonological ambiguities where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words for example ice cream and i scream such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context a mishearing of such based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity is called a mondegreen philosophy philosophers and other users of logic spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing or intentionally adding ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments for example a politician might say i oppose taxes which hinder economic growth an example of a glittering generality some will think they oppose taxes in general because they hinder economic growth others may think they oppose only those taxes that they believe will hinder economic growth in writing the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation either by adding a comma after taxes to convey the first sense or by changing which to that to convey the second sense or by rewriting it in other ways the devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way and think the politician supports everyones opinion however the opposite can also be truean opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity intentionally or not the logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases in continental philosophy particularly phenomenology and existentialism there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition martin heidegger argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous as is the relation of mind and body and part and whole in heideggers phenomenology dasein is always in a meaningful world but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification thus although some things may be certain they have little to do with daseins sense of care and existential anxiety eg in the face of death in calling his work being and nothingness an essay in phenomenological ontology jeanpaul sartre follows heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity simone de beauvoir tries to base an ethics on heideggers and sartres writings the ethics of ambiguity where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought most of them have tried to mask it  and the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples has always pursued the same goal it has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science she states since we do not succeed in fleeing it let us therefore try to look the truth in the face let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity it is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life nature and sex are ambiguous corey anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else language he asserts divides what is not in fact separate following ernest becker he argues that the desire to authoritatively disambiguate the world and existence has led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide on this basis he argues that ethics must focus on dialectically integrating opposites and balancing tension rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty like the existentialists and phenomenologists he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity literature and rhetoric in literature and rhetoric ambiguity can be a useful tool groucho marxs classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor for example last night i shot an elephant in my pajamas how he got in my pajamas ill never know songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect as in the song title dont it make my brown eyes blue where blue can refer to the color or to sadness in the narrative ambiguity can be introduced in several ways motive plot character f scott fitzgerald uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel the great gatsby mathematical notation mathematical notation is a helpful tool that eliminates a lot of misunderstandings associated with natural language in physics and other sciences nonetheless there are still some inherent ambiguities due to lexical syntactic and semantic reasons that persist in mathematical notation names of functions the ambiguity in the style of writing a function should not be confused with a multivalued function which can and should be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way several special functions still do not have established notations usually the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument or the resulting value sometimes the same name of the function is used causing confusions examples of such underestablished functions expressions ambiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts in the scientific journal style one uses roman letters to denote elementary functions whereas variables are written using italics commas in multicomponent subscripts and superscripts are sometimes omitted this is also potentially ambiguous notation examples of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions notations in quantum optics and quantum mechanics ambiguous terms in physics and mathematics some physical quantities do not yet have established notations their value and sometimes even dimension as in the case of the einstein coefficients depends on the system of notations many terms are ambiguous each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition suitable for a specific case just like ludwig wittgenstein states in tractatus logicophilosophicus  only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning a highly confusing term is gain for example the sentence the gain of a system should be doubled without context means close to nothing the term intensity is ambiguous when applied to light the term can refer to any of irradiance luminous intensity radiant intensity or radiance depending on the background of the person using the term also confusions may be related with the use of atomic percent as measure of concentration of a dopant or resolution of an imaging system as measure of the size of the smallest detail that still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise see also accuracy and precision the berry paradox arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as definable or nameable terms of this kind give rise to vicious circle fallacies other terms with this type of ambiguity are satisfiable true false function property class relation cardinal and ordinal mathematical interpretation of ambiguity logical ambiguity and selfcontradiction is analogous to visual ambiguity and impossible objects such as the necker cube and impossible cube or many of the drawings of m c escher constructed language some languages have been created with the intention of avoiding ambiguity especially lexical ambiguity lojban and loglan are two related languages that have been created for this focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well the languages can be both spoken and written these languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages although historically such attempts at language improvement have been criticized languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency the many exceptions to syntax and semantic rules are timeconsuming and difficult to learn biology in structural biology ambiguity has been recognized as a problem for studying protein conformations the analysis of a protein threedimensional structure consists in dividing the macromolecule into subunits called domains the difficulty of this task arises from the fact that different definitions of what a domain is can be used eg folding autonomy function thermodynamic stability or domain motions which sometimes results in a single protein having differentyet equally validdomain assignments christianity and judaism christianity and judaism employ the concept of paradox synonymously with ambiguity many christians and jews endorse rudolf ottos description of the sacred as mysterium tremendum et fascinans the aweinspiring mystery that fascinates humansmay 2019 the apocryphal book of judith is noted for the ingenious ambiguity expressed by its heroine for example she says to the villain of the story holofernes my lord will not fail to achieve his purposes without specifying whether my lord refers to the villain or to god the orthodox catholic writer g k chesterton regularly employed paradox to tease out the meanings in common concepts that he found ambiguous or to reveal meaning often overlooked or forgotten in common phrases the title of one of his most famous books orthodoxy 1908 itself employed such a paradox music in music pieces or sections that confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous such as some polytonality polymeter other ambiguous meters or rhythms and ambiguous phrasing or stein 2005 p 79 any aspect of music the music of africa is often purposely ambiguous to quote sir donald francis tovey 1935 p 195 theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value visual art in visual art certain images are visually ambiguous such as the necker cube which can be interpreted in two ways perceptions of such objects remain stable for a time then may flip a phenomenon called multistable perception the opposite of such ambiguous images are impossible objects pictures or photographs may also be ambiguous at the semantic level the visual image is unambiguous but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous is a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear for instance social psychology and the bystander effect in social psychology ambiguity is a factor used in determining peoples responses to various situations high levels of ambiguity in an emergency eg an unconscious man lying on a park bench make witnesses less likely to offer any sort of assistance due to the fear that they may have misinterpreted the situation and acted unnecessarily alternately nonambiguous emergencies eg an injured person verbally asking for help elicit more consistent intervention and assistance with regard to the bystander effect studies have shown that emergencies deemed ambiguous trigger the appearance of the classic bystander effect wherein more witnesses decrease the likelihood of any of them helping far more than nonambiguous emergencies computer science in computer science the si prefixes kilo mega and giga were historically used in certain contexts to mean either the first three powers of 1024 1024 10242 and 10243 contrary to the metric system in which these units unambiguously mean one thousand one million and one billion this usage is particularly prevalent with electronic memory devices eg dram addressed directly by a binary machine register where a decimal interpretation makes no practical sense subsequently the ki mi and gi prefixes were introduced so that binary prefixes could be written explicitly also rendering k m and g unambiguous in texts conforming to the new standardthis led to a new ambiguity in engineering documents lacking outward trace of the binary prefixes necessarily indicating the new style as to whether the usage of k m and g remains ambiguous old style or not new style 1 m where m is ambiguously 1000000 or 1048576 is less uncertain than the engineering value 10 defined to designate the interval 950000 as nonvolatile storage devices begin to exceed 1 gb in capacity where the ambiguity begins to routinely impact the second significant digit gb and tb almost always mean 109 and 1012 bytes see also references

offering god accepted his offering but not his brothers cain then killed abel out of jealousy according to genesis this was the first murder and abel was the first dead person in the history of mankind life and death interpretations jewish and christian interpretations according to the narrative in genesis abel הבל hébel in pausa הבל hāḇel ἅβελ hábel هابيل hābēl is eves second son his name in hebrew is composed of the same three consonants as a root meaning the air that remains after you exhale also synonymous in hebrew to nothing as stated in  ecclesiastes julius wellhausen has proposed that the name is independent of the root eberhard schrader had previously put forward the akkadian old assyrian dialect ablu son as a more likely etymology in christianity comparisons are sometimes made between the death of abel and that of jesus the former thus seen as being the first martyr in matthew jesus speaks of abel as righteous and the epistle to the hebrews states that the blood of sprinkling  speaks better things than that of abel hebrews the blood of jesus is interpreted as bringing mercy but that of abel as demanding vengeance hence the curse and mark abel is invoked in the litany for the dying in the roman catholic church and his sacrifice is mentioned in the canon of the mass along with those of abraham and melchizedek the alexandrian rite commemorates him with a feast day on december 28 according to the coptic book of adam and eve at 2115 and the syriac cave of treasures abels body after many days of mourning was placed in the cave of treasures before which adam and eve and descendants offered their prayers in addition the sethite line of the generations of adam swear by abels blood to segregate themselves from the unrighteous in the book of enoch 227 regarded by most christian and jewish traditions as extrabiblical the soul of abel is described as having been appointed as the chief of martyrs crying for vengeance for the destruction of the seed of cain a similar view is later shown in the testament of abraham a13  b11 where abel has been raised to the position as the judge of the souls in bereshit rabbah 222 a discussion of gen 41 ff has rabbi yehoshua ben korcha mentioning that cain was born with a twin sister and abel with two twin sisters this is based on the principle that the otherwise superfluous accusative article et always conveys some additional teaching pesachim 22b the ets are parsed slightly differently in yebamot 62a where the two ets in gen 42 indicate cain and his sister and abel and his one sister sethian gnostic

zanclean first appearances taxa named by peter simon pallas afrikaans words and phrases the aardvark ˈ ard orycteropus afer is a mediumsized burrowing nocturnal mammal native to africa it is the only living species of the order tubulidentata although other prehistoric species and genera of tubulidentata are known like most other insectivores it has a long snout similar to that of a pig which is used to sniff out food the aardvark is found over much of the southern twothirds of the african continent avoiding areas that are mainly rocky a nocturnal feeder it subsists on ants and termites which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs it also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young the animal is listed as least concern by the iucn although its numbers are decreasing aardvarks are afrotheres a clade which also includes elephants manatees and hyraxes name and taxonomy name the aardvark is sometimes colloquially called the african ant bear anteater not to be confused with the south american anteaters or the cape anteater after the cape of good hope the name aardvark is afrikaans af comes from earlier afrikaans erdvark and means earth pig or ground pig aarde earth vark pig or young pigchild because of its burrowing habits the name orycteropus means burrowing foot and the name afer refers to africa the name of the aardvarks order tubulidentata comes from the tubulestyle teeth taxonomy the aardvark is not closely related to the pig rather it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian order tubulidentata in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus orycteropus the sole surviving genus in the family orycteropodidae the aardvark is not closely related to the south american anteater despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance the similarities are the outcome of convergent evolution the closest living relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrews tenrecidae and golden moles along with sirenians hyraxes elephants and their extinct relatives these animals form the superorder afrotheria studies of the brain have shown the similarities with condylarthra evolutionary history based on fossils bryan patterson has concluded that early relatives of the aardvark appeared in africa around the end of the paleocene the ptolemaiidans a mysterious clade of mammals with uncertain affinities may actually be stemaardvarks either as a sister clade to tubulidentata or as a grade leading to true tubulidentates the first unambiguous tubulidentate was probably myorycteropus africanus from kenyan miocene deposits the earliest example from the genus orycteropus was orycteropus mauritanicus found in algeria in deposits from the middle miocene with an equally old version found in kenya fossils from the aardvark have been dated to 5 million years and have been located throughout europe and the near east the mysterious pleistocene plesiorycteropus from madagascar was originally thought to be a tubulidentate that was descended from ancestors that entered the island during the eocene however a number of subtle anatomical differences coupled with recent molecular evidence now lead researchers to believe that plesiorycteropus is a relative of golden moles and tenrecs that achieved an aardvarklike appearance and ecological niche through convergent evolution subspecies the aardvark has seventeen poorly defined subspecies listed the 1911 encyclopædia britannica also mentions o a capensis or cape antbear from south africa description the aardvark is vaguely piglike in appearance its body is stout with a prominently arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs the limbs are of moderate length with the rear legs being longer than the forelegs the front feet have lost the pollex or thumb resulting in four toes while the rear feet have all five toes each toe bears a large robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovellike and appears to be intermediate between a claw and a hoof whereas the aardvark is considered digitigrade it appears at times to be plantigrade this confusion happens because when it squats it stands on its soles a contributing characteristic to the burrow digging capabilities of aardvarks is an endosteal tissue called compacted coarse cancellous bone cccb the stress and strain resistance provided by cccb allows aardvarks to create their burrows ultimately leading to a favourable environment for plants and a variety of animalsan aardvarks weight is typically between 60 an aardvarks length is usually between 105 and can reach lengths of 22 when its tail which can be up to 70 is taken into account it is 60 tall at the shoulder and has a girth of about 100 it is the largest member of the proposed clade afroinsectiphilia the aardvark is pale yellowishgrey in colour and often stained reddishbrown by soil the aardvarks coat is thin and the animals primary protection is its tough skin its hair is short on its head and tail however its legs tend to have longer hair the hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of 34 hairs the hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers head the greatly elongated head is set on a short thick neck and the end of the snout bears a disc which houses the nostrils it contains a thin but complete zygomatic arch the head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features one of the most distinctive characteristics of the tubulidentata is their teeth instead of having a pulp cavity each tooth has a cluster of thin hexagonal upright parallel tubes of vasodentin a modified form of dentine with individual pulp canals held together by cementum the number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth with the largest having about 1500 the teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously the aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw which fall out and are not replaced adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the jaw and have a dental formula of 00233 these remaining teeth are peglike and rootless and are of unique composition the teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars the nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area as it contains ten nasal conchae more than any other placental mammal the sides of the nostrils are thick with hair the tip of the snout is highly mobile and is moved by modified mimetic muscles the fleshy dividing tissue between its nostrils probably has sensory functions but it is uncertain whether they are olfactory or vibratory in nature its nose is made up of more turbinate bones than any other mammal with between 9 and 11 compared to dogs with 4 to 5 with a large quantity of turbinate bones the aardvark has more space for the moist epithelium which is the location of the olfactory bulb the nose contains nine olfactory bulbs more than any other mammal its keen sense of smell is not just from the quantity of bulbs in the nose but also in the development of the brain as its olfactory lobe is very developed the snout resembles an elongated pig snout the mouth is small and tubular typical of species that feed on ants and termites the aardvark has a long thin snakelike protruding tongue as much as 30 long and elaborate structures supporting a keen sense of smell the ears which are very effective are disproportionately long about 20 long the eyes are small for its head and consist only of rods digestive system the aardvarks stomach has a muscular pyloric area that acts as a gizzard to grind swallowed food up thereby rendering chewing unnecessary its cecum is large both sexes emit a strong smelling secretion from an anal gland its salivary glands are highly developed and almost completely ring the neck their output is what causes the tongue to maintain its tackiness the female has two pairs of teats in the inguinal region genetically speaking the aardvark is a living fossil as its chromosomes are highly conserved reflecting much of the early eutherian arrangement before the divergence of the major modern taxa habitat and range aardvarks are found in subsaharan africa where suitable habitat savannas grasslands woodlands and bushland and food ie ants and termites is available they spend the daylight hours in dark burrows to avoid the heat of the day the only major habitat that they are not present in is swamp forest as the high water table precludes digging to a sufficient depth they also avoid terrain rocky enough to cause problems with digging they have been documented as high as 3200 in ethiopia they are present throughout subsaharan africa all the way to south africa with few exceptions including the coastal areas of namibia ivory coast and ghana they are not found in madagascar ecology and behaviour aardvarks live for up to 23 years in captivity its keen hearing warns it of predators lions leopards cheetahs african wild dogs hyenas and pythons some humans also hunt aardvarks for meat aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies but if all else fails they will strike with their claws tail and shoulders sometimes flipping onto their backs lying motionless except to lash out with all four feet they are capable of causing substantial damage to unprotected areas of an attacker they will also dig to escape as they can sometimes when pressed aardvarks can dig extremely quickly feeding the aardvark is nocturnal and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites myrmecophagy the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber in fact the cucumber and the aardvark have a symbiotic relationship as they eat the subterranean fruit then defecate the seeds near their burrows which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area the time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark they avoid eating the african driver ant and red ants due to their stringent diet requirements they require a large range to survive an aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset and forages over a considerable home range encompassing 10 while foraging for food the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food they zigzag as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for 58 days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again during a foraging period they will stop to dig a vshaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location when a concentration of ants or termites is detected the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long sticky tongueas many as 50000 in one night have been recorded its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly it avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils when successful the aardvarks long up to 30 tongue licks up the insects the termites biting or the ants stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin after an aardvark visit at a termite mound other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers termite mounds alone do not provide enough food for the aardvark so they look for termites that are on the move when these insects move they can form columns 10 long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark these columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals the trampled grass and dung attract termites from the odontotermes microtermes and pseudacanthotermes genera on a nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of night roughly the four hours between 800nbsppm and 1200nbspam however they do not seem to prefer bright or dark nights over the other during adverse weather or if disturbed they will retreat to their burrow systems they cover between 2 per night however some studies have shown that they may traverse as far as 30 in a night aardvarks shift their circadian rhythms to more diurnal activity patterns in response to a reduced food supply this survival tactic may signify an increased risk of imminent mortality vocalisation the aardvark is a rather quiet animal however it does make soft grunting sounds as it forages and loud grunts as it makes for its tunnel entrance it makes a bleating sound if frightened when it is threatened it will make for one of its burrows if one is not close it will dig a new one rapidly this new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear movement the aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents it can dig a yard of tunnel in about five minutes but otherwise moves fairly slowly when leaving the burrow at night they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes sniffing and listening after this period of watchfulness it will bound out and within seconds it will be 10 away it will then pause prick its ears twisting its head to listen then jump and move off to start foraging aside from digging out ants and termites the aardvark also excavates burrows in which to live which generally fall into one of three categories burrows made while foraging refuge and resting location and permanent homes temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges while the main burrow is also used for breeding main burrows can be deep and extensive have several entrances and can be as long as 13 these burrows can be large enough for a person to enter the aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly and periodically moves on and makes a new one the old burrows are an important part of the african wildlife scene as they are vacated then they are inhabited by smaller animals like the african wild dog anteating chat nycteris thebaica and warthogs other animals that use them are hares mongooses hyenas owls pythons and lizards without these refuges many animals would die during wildfire season only mothers and young share burrows however the aardvark is known to live in small family groups or as a solitary creature if attacked in the tunnel it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and its predator or if it decides to fight it will roll onto its back and attack with its claws the aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest which also serves as protection from its predators reproduction aardvarks pair only during the breeding season after a gestation period of seven months one cub weighing around 17 is born during mayjuly when born the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles when nursing it will nurse off each teat in succession after two weeks the folds of skin disappear and after three the ears can be held upright after 56 weeks body hair starts growing it is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks and eats termites at 9 weeks and is weaned between three months and 16 weeks at six months of age it is able to dig its own burrows but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season and is sexually mature from approximately two years of age conservation aardvarks were thought to have declining numbers however this is possibly because they are not readily seen there are no definitive counts because of their nocturnal and secretive habits however their numbers seem to be stable overall they are not considered common anywhere in africa but due to their large range they maintain sufficient numbers there may be a slight decrease in numbers in eastern northern and western africa southern african numbers are not decreasing it has received an official designation from the iucn as least concern however they are a species in a precarious situation as they are so dependent on such specific food therefore if a problem arises with the abundance of termites the species as a whole would be affected drastically recent research suggests that aardvarks may be particularly vulnerable to alterations in temperature caused by climate change droughts negatively impact the availability of termites and ants which comprise the bulk of an aardvarks diet nocturnal species faced with resource scarcity may increase their diurnal activity to spare the energy costs of staying warm at night but this comes at the cost of withstanding high temperatures during the day a study on aardvarks in the kalahari desert saw that five out of six aardvarks being studied perished following a drought aardvarks that survive droughts can take long periods of time to regain health and optimal thermoregulatory physiology reducing the reproductive potential of the species aardvarks handle captivity well the first zoo to have one was london zoo in 1869 which had an animal from south africa mythology and popular culture in african folklore the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to soldier ants hausa magicians make a charm from the heart skin forehead and nails of the aardvark which they then proceed to pound together with the root of a certain tree wrapped in a piece of skin and worn on the chest the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night the charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents permission also some tribes such as the margbetu ayanda and logo will use aardvark teeth to make bracelets which are regarded as good luck charms the meat which has a resemblance to pork is eaten in certain cultures in the mythology of the dagbon people of ghana the aardvark is believed to possess superpowers the dagombas believe this animal can transfigure into and interact with humans the ancient egyptian god set is usually depicted with the head of an unidentified animal whose similarity to an aardvark has been noted in scholarship the titular character and his families from arthur an animated television series for children based on a book series

employing ordnance that could penetrate deep into the ground in the us navy the squadron vf114 was nicknamed the aardvarks flying f4s and then f14s the squadron mascot was adapted from the animal in

carnivorans of africa hyenas mammals of southern africa fauna of east africa myrmecophagous mammals taxa named by anders sparrman the aardwolf proteles cristatus is an insectivorous hyaenid species native to east and southern africa its name means earthwolf in afrikaans and dutch it is also called the maanhaarjackal afrikaans for manejackal termiteeating hyena and civet hyena based on its habit of secreting substances from its anal gland a characteristic shared with the african civet unlike many of its relatives in the order carnivora the aardwolf does not hunt large animals it eats insects and their larvae mainly termites one aardwolf can lap up as many as 300000 termites during a single night using its long sticky tongue the aardwolfs tongue has adapted to be tough enough to withstand the strong bite of termites the aardwolf lives in the shrublands of eastern and southern africa  open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs it is nocturnal resting in burrows during the day and emerging at night to seek food taxonomy the aardwolf is generally classified with the hyena family hyaenidae though it was formerly placed in its own family protelidae early on scientists felt that it was merely mimicking the striped hyena which subsequently led to the creation of protelidae recent studies have suggested that the aardwolf probably diverged from other hyaenids early on how early is still unclear as the fossil record and genetic studies disagree by 10 million years the aardwolf is the only surviving species in the subfamily protelinae there is disagreement as to whether the species is monotypic or can be divided into subspecies p c cristatus of southern africa and p c septentrionalis of east africa a 2006 molecular analysis indicates that it is phylogenetically the most basal of the four extant hyaenidae species etymology the generic name proteles comes from two words both of greek origin protos and teleos which combined means complete in front based on the fact that they have five toes on their front feet and four on the rear the specific name cristatus comes from latin and means provided with a comb relating to their mane description the aardwolf resembles a much smaller and thinner striped hyena with a more slender muzzle black vertical stripes on a coat of yellowish fur and a long distinct mane down the midline of the neck and back it also has one or two diagonal stripes down the fore and hindquarters along with several stripes on its legs the mane is raised during confrontations to make the aardwolf appear larger it is missing the throat spot that others in the family have its lower leg from the knee down is all black and its tail is bushy with a black tip the aardwolf is about 55 long excluding its bushy tail which is about 20 long and stands about 40 tall at the shoulders an adult aardwolf weighs approximately 7 sometimes reaching 15 the aardwolves in the south of the continent tend to be smaller about 10 than the eastern version around 14 this makes the aardwolf the smallest extant member of the hyaenidae family the front feet have five toes each unlike the fourtoed hyena the skull is similar in shape to those of other hyenas though much smaller and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects it does still have canines but unlike other hyenas these teeth are used primarily for fighting and defense its ears which are large are very similar to those of the striped hyena as an aardwolf ages it will normally lose some of its teeth though this has little impact on its feeding habits due to the softness of the insects that it eats distribution and habitat aardwolves live in open dry plains and bushland avoiding mountainous areas due to their specific food requirements they are found only in regions where termites of the family hodotermitidae occur termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed grasslands and savannahs including farmland for most of the year aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens which are occupied for six weeks at a time there are two distinct populations one in southern africa and another in east and northeast africa the species does not occur in the intermediary miombo forests an adult pair along with their mostrecent offspring occupies a territory of 1 behavior and ecology aardwolves are shy and nocturnal sleeping in burrows by day they will on occasion during the winter become diurnal feeders this happens during the coldest periods as they then stay in at night to conserve heat they are primarily solitary animals though during mating season they form monogamous pairs which occupy a territory with their young if their territory is infringed upon they will chase the intruder away for up to 400 or to the border if the intruder is caught which rarely happens a fight will occur which is accompanied by soft clucking hoarse barking and a type of roar the majority of incursions occur during mating season when they can occur once or twice per week when food is scarce the stringent territorial system may be abandoned and as many as three pairs may occupy a single territory the territory is marked by both sexes as they both have developed anal glands from which they extrude a black substance that is smeared on rocks or grass stalks in 5long streaks aardwolves also have scent glands on the forefoot and penile pad they often mark near termite mounds within their territory every 20 minutes or so if they are patrolling their territorial boundaries the marking frequency increases drastically to once every 50 at this rate an individual may mark 60 marks per hour and upwards of 200 per night an aardwolf pair may have up to 10 dens and numerous feces middens within their territory when they deposit excreta at their middens they dig a small hole and cover it with sand their dens are usually abandoned aardvark springhare or porcupine dens or on occasion they are crevices in rocks they will also dig their own dens or enlarge dens started by springhares they typically will only use one or two dens at a time rotating through all of their dens every six months during the summer they may rest outside their den during the night and sleep underground during the heat of the day aardwolves are not fast runners nor are they particularly adept at fighting off predators therefore when threatened the aardwolf may attempt to mislead its foe by doubling back on its tracks if confronted it may raise its mane in an attempt to appear more menacing it also emits a foulsmelling liquid from its anal glands feeding the aardwolf feeds primarily on termites and more specifically on trinervitermes this genus of termites has different species throughout the aardwolfs range in east africa they eat trinervitermes bettonianus in central africa they eat trinervitermes rhodesiensis and in southern africa they eat t trinervoides their technique consists of licking them off the ground as opposed to the aardvark which digs into the mound they locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites an aardwolf may consume up to 250000 termites per night using its long broad sticky tongue they do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food they often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months during certain seasonal events such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of midwinter the primary termites become scarce so the need for other foods becomes pronounced during these times the southern aardwolf will seek out hodotermes mossambicus a type of harvester termite active in the afternoon which explains some of their diurnal behavior in the winter the eastern aardwolf during the rainy season subsists on termites from the genera odontotermes and macrotermes they are also known to feed on other insects and larvae and some sources mention occasionally eggs small mammals and birds but these constitute a very small percentage of their total diet they use their wide tongues to lap surface foraging termites off of the ground and consume large quantities of sand in the process which aids in digestion in the absence of teeth to break down their food unlike other hyenas aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals contrary to popular myths aardwolves do not eat carrion and if they are seen eating while hunched over a dead carcass they are actually eating larvae and beetles also contrary to some sources they do not like meat unless it is finely ground or cooked for them the adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups but more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey their primary source trinervitermes forages in small but dense patches of 25 while foraging the aardwolf can cover about 1 per hour which translates to 8 per summer night and 3 per winter night breeding the breeding season varies depending on location but normally takes place during autumn or spring in south africa breeding occurs in early july during the breeding season unpaired male aardwolves search their own territory as well as others for a female to mate with dominant males also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves which can result in conflict between rival males dominant males even go a step further and as the breeding season approaches they make increasingly greater and greater incursions onto weaker males territories as the female comes into oestrus they add pasting to their tricks inside of the other territories sometimes doing so more in rivals territories than their own females will also when given the opportunity mate with the dominant male which increases the chances of the dominant male guarding his cubs with her copulation lasts between 1 and 45 hours gestation lasts between 89 and 92 days producing two to five cubs most often two or three during the rainy season novemberdecember when termites are more active they are born with their eyes open but initially are helpless and weigh around 200 the first six to eight weeks are spent in the den with their parents the male may spend up to six hours a night watching over the cubs while the mother is out looking for food after three months they begin supervised foraging and by four months are normally independent though they often share a den with their mother until the next breeding season by the time the next set of cubs is born the older cubs have moved on aardwolves generally achieve sexual maturity at one and a half to two years of age conservation the aardwolf has not seen decreasing numbers and is relatively widespread throughout eastern africa they are not common throughout their range as they maintain a density of no more than 1 per square kilometer if food is abundant because of these factors the iucn has rated the aardwolf as least concern in some areas they are persecuted because of the mistaken belief that they prey on livestock however they are actually beneficial to the farmers because they eat termites that are detrimental in other areas the farmers have recognized this but they are still killed on occasion for their fur dogs and insecticides are also common killers of the aardwolf in captivity frankfurt zoo in germany was home to the oldest recorded aardwolf in captivity at 18 years and 11 months notes

the same advantage the most desirable soil texture for producing the mud of adobe is 15 clay 1030 silt and 5575 fine sand another source quotes 1525 clay and the remainder sand and coarser particles up to cobbles 2 with no deleterious effect modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or portland cement up to 10 by weight no more than half the clay content should be expansive clays with the remainder nonexpansive illite or kaolinite too much expansive clay results in uneven drying through the brick resulting in cracking while too much kaolinite will make a weak brick typically the soils of the southwest united states where such construction has been widely used are an adequate composition material properties adobe walls are load bearing ie they carry their own weight into the foundation rather than by another structure hence the adobe must have sufficient compressive strength in the united states most building codes call for a minimum compressive strength of 300 lbfin2 207 newtonmm2 for the adobe block adobe construction should be designed so as to avoid lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads the building codes require the building sustain a 1 g lateral acceleration earthquake load such an acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile stresses to withstand such loads the codes typically call for a tensile modulus of rupture strength of at least 50 lbfin2 0345 newtonmm2 for the finished block in addition to being an inexpensive material with a small resource cost adobe can serve as a significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction in climates typified by hot days and cool nights the high thermal mass of adobe mediates the high and low temperatures of the day moderating the temperature of the living space the massive walls require a large and relatively long input of heat from the sun radiation and from the surrounding air convection before they warm through to the interior after the sun sets and the temperature drops the warm wall will continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the timelag effect thus a wellplanned adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling inside temperature through the wide daily fluctuations typical of desert climates a factor which has contributed to its longevity as a building material thermodynamic material properties have significant variation in the literature some experiments suggest that the standard consideration of conductivity is not adequate for this material as its main thermodynamic property is inertia and conclude that experimental tests should be performed over a longer period of time than usual  preferably with changing thermal jumps there is an effective rvalue for a north facing 10in wall of r010 hr ft2 fbtu which corresponds to thermal conductivity k10 in x 1 ft12 in r0033 btuhr ft f or 057 wm k in agreement with the thermal conductivity reported from another source to determine the total rvalue of a wall scale r0 by the thickness of the wall in inches the thermal resistance of

making individual dried bricks or using a form puddle is a general term for a clay or clay and sandbased material worked into a dense plastic state these are the oldest methods of building with adobe in the americas until holes in the ground were used as forms and later wooden forms used to make individual bricks were introduced by the spanish adobe bricks bricks made from adobe are usually made by pressing the mud mixture into an open timber frame in north america the brick is typically about 25 in size the mixture is molded into the frame which is removed after initial setting after drying for a few hours the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying slow drying in shade reduces cracking the same mixture without straw is used to make mortar and often plaster on interior and exterior walls some cultures used limebased cement for the plaster to protect against rain damageoctober 2008 depending on the form into which the mixture is pressed adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks reinforcement can include manure straw cement rebar or wooden posts straw cement or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can produce a stronger more crackresistant brick a test is done on the soil content first to do so a sample of the soil is mixed into a clear container with some water creating an almost completely saturated liquid the container is shaken vigorously for one minute it is then allowed to settle for a day until the soil has settled into layers heavier particles settle out first sand above silt above that and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days after the water has cleared percentages of the various particles can be determined fifty to 60 percent sand and 35 to 40 percent clay will yield strong bricks the cooperative state research education and extension service at new mexico state university recommends a mix of not more than 1 clay not less than 1 sand and never more than 1 silt during the great depression designer and builder hugh w comstock used cheaper materials and made a specialized adobe brick called bitudobe his first adobe house was built in 1936 in 1948 he published the book postadobe simplified adobe construction combining a rugged timber frame and modern stabilized adobe which described his method of construction including how to make bitudobe in 1938 he served as an adviser to the architects franklin  kump associates who built the carmel high school which used his postadobe system adobe wall construction the ground supporting an adobe structure should be compressed as the weight of adobe wall is significant and foundation settling may cause cracking of the wall footing depth is to be below the ground frost level the footing and stem wall are commonly 24 and 14 inches thick respectively modern construction codes call for the use of reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall adobe bricks are laid by course adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength when creating window and door openings a lintel is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above atop the last courses of brick bond beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces to protect the interior and exterior adobe walls finishes such as mud plaster whitewash or stucco can be applied these protect the adobe wall from water damage but need to be reapplied periodically alternatively the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters adobe roof the traditional adobe roof has been constructed using a mixture of soilclay water sand and organic materials the mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across a support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe depending on the materials available a roof may be assembled using wood or metal beams to create a framework to begin layering adobe bricks depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks the framework has been preformed using a steel framing and a layering of a metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly this method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent cracking the more traditional flat adobe roofs are functional only in dry climates that are not exposed to snow loads the heaviest wooden beams called vigas lie atop the wall across the vigas lie smaller members called latillas and upon those brush is then laid finally the adobe layer is applied to construct a flat adobe roof beams of wood were laid to span the building the ends of which were attached to the tops of the walls once the vigas latillas and brush are laid adobe bricks are placed an adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a greater expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the roof following each individual brick should be a layer of adobe mortar recommended to be at least 1 thick to make certain there is ample strength between the bricks edges and also to provide a relative moisture barrier during rain roof design evolved around 1850 in the american southwest three inches of adobe mud was applied on top of the latillas then 18 inches of dry adobe dirt applied to the roof the dirt was contoured into a low slope to a downspout aka a canal when moisture was applied to the roof the clay particles expanded to create a waterproof membrane once a year it was necessary to pull the weeds from the roof and reslope the dirt as neededmay 2018 depending on the materials adobe roofs can be inherently fireproof the construction of a chimney can greatly influence the construction of the roof supports creating an extra need for care in choosing the materials the builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in a similar fashion as the surrounding walls in 1927 the uniform building code ubc was adopted in the united states local ordinances referencing the ubc added requirements to building with adobe these included restriction of building height of adobe structures to 1story requirements for adobe mix compressive and shear strength and new requirements which stated that every building shall be designed to withstand seismic activity specifically lateral forces by the 1980s however seismic related changes in the california building code effectively ended solid wall adobe construction in california however postandbeam adobe and veneers are still being used adobe around the world the largest structure ever made from adobe is the argé bam built by the achaemenid empire other large adobe structures are the huaca del sol in peru with 100 million signed bricks and the ciudellas of chan chan and tambo colorado both in peru see also references external links adventure categories adventure an adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold sometimes risky adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling exploring skydiving mountain climbing scuba diving river rafting or other extreme sports adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities motivation adventurous experiences create psychological arousal which can be interpreted as negative eg fear or positive eg flow for some people adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself according to adventurer andré malraux in his mans fate 1933 if a man is not ready to risk his life where is his dignity similarly helen keller stated that life is either a daring adventure or nothing outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneerssndthe british adventurer jason lewis for example uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning author jon levy suggests that an experience should meet several criteria to be considered an adventure mythology and fiction some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as homers odyssey the knight errant was the form the adventure seeker character took in the late middle ages adventure fiction exhibits these protagonist on adventurous journey characteristics as do many popular feature films such as star wars and raiders of the lost ark outdoors adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the wilderness or mother nature examples include books such as hatchet or my side of the mountain these books are less about questing such as in mythology or other adventure novels but more about surviving on their own living off the land gaining new experiences and becoming closer to the natural world questing many adventures are based on the idea of a quest the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward whether it be a skill prize treasure or perhaps the safety of a person on the way the hero must overcome various obstacles to obtain their reward video games in video game culture an adventure game is a video game in which the player assumes the role of a protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzle solving the genres focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrativebased media literature and film encompassing a wide variety of literary genres many adventure games text and graphic are designed for a single player since this emphasis on story and character makes multiplayer design difficult nonfiction works from ancient times travelers and explorers have written about their adventures journals which became bestsellers in their day were written such as marco polos journal the travels of marco polo or mark twains roughing it others were personal journals only later published such as the journals of meriwether lewis and william clark or captain james cooks journals there are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question such as the right stuff by tom wolfe or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal such as conquistadors of the useless by lionel terray documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well adventure sports there are many sports classified as adventure sports due to their inherent danger and excitement some of these include mountain climbing skydiving or other extreme sports see also references external links asia categories asia continents asia ˈ ay ukalso ay is the largest continentasia is normally considered its own continent in the english speaking world which uses the seven continent model other models consider asia as part of a eurasian or afroeurasian continent see continentnumber for more information in the world by both land area and population it covers an area of more than 44 million square kilometers44579000 square kilometres 17212000 square miles about 30 of earths total land area and 8 of earths total surface area the continent which has long been home to the majority of the human population was the site of many of the first civilizations its 47 billion people constitute roughly 60 of the worlds population asia shares the landmass of eurasia with europe and of afroeurasia with both europe and africa in general terms it is bounded on the east by the pacific ocean on the south by the indian ocean and on the north by the arctic ocean the border of asia with europe is a historical and cultural construct as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them it is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity the division of eurasia into two continents reflects eastwest cultural linguistic and ethnic differences some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line a commonly accepted division places asia to the east of the suez canal separating it from africa and to the east of the turkish straits the ural mountains and ural river and to the south of the caucasus mountains and the caspian and black seas separating it from europe china and india traded places as the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1800 ce china was a major economic power for much of recorded history with the highest gdp per capita until 1500 the silk road became the main eastwest trading route in the asian hinterlands while the straits of malacca stood as a major sea route asia has exhibited economic dynamism as well as robust population growth during the 20th century but overall population growth has since fallen asia was the birthplace of most of the worlds mainstream religions including hinduism zoroastrianism judaism jainism buddhism confucianism taoism christianity islam sikhism as well as many other religions asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups cultures environments economics historical ties and government systems it also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot deserts in west asia temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in siberia definition and boundaries asiaafrica boundary the boundary between asia and africa is the suez canal the gulf of suez the red sea and the babelmandeb this makes egypt a transcontinental country with the sinai peninsula in asia and the remainder of the country in africa asiaeurope boundary the threefold division of the old world into africa asia and europe has been in use since the 6th century bce due to greek geographers such as anaximander and hecataeusjune 2020 anaximander placed the boundary between asia and europe along the phasis river the modern rioni river in georgia of caucasus from its mouth by poti on the black sea coast through the surami pass and along the kura river to the caspian sea a convention still followed by herodotus in the 5th century bce during the hellenistic period this convention was revised and the boundary between europe and asia was now considered to be the tanais the modern don river this is the convention used by roman era authors such as posidonius strabo and ptolemy the border between asia and europe was historically defined by european academics the don river became unsatisfactory to northern europeans when peter the great king of the tsardom of russia defeating rival claims of sweden and the ottoman empire to the eastern lands and armed resistance by the tribes of siberia synthesized a new russian empire extending to the ural mountains and beyond founded in 1721october 2011 in sweden five years after peters death in 1730 philip johan von strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the ural mountains as the border of asia tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von strahlenberg the latter had suggested the emba river as the lower boundary over the next century various proposals were made until the ural river prevailed in the mid19th century the border had been moved perforce from the black sea to the caspian sea into which the ural river projects the border between the black sea and the caspian is usually placed along the crest of the caucasus mountains although it is sometimes placed further north asiaoceania boundary the border between asia and the region of oceania is usually placed somewhere in the indonesia archipelago the maluku islands are often considered to lie on the border of southeast asia with indonesian new guinea to the east of the islands being wholly part of oceania the terms southeast asia and oceania devised in the 19th century have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception the chief factor in determining which islands of the indonesian archipelago are asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there not all european lewis and wigen assert the narrowing of southeast asia to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process asianorth america boundary the bering strait and bering sea separate the landmasses of asia and north america as well as forming the international boundary between russia and the united states this national and continental boundary separates the diomede islands in the bering strait with big diomede in russia and little diomede in the united states the aleutian islands are an island chain extending westward from the alaskan peninsula toward russias komandorski islands and kamchatka peninsula most of them are always associated with north america except for the westernmost near islands group which is on asias continental shelf beyond the north aleutians basin and on rare occasions could be associated with asia which could then allow the us state of alaska as well as the united states itself to be considered a transcontinental state the aleutian islands are sometimes associated with oceania owing to their status as remote pacific islands and their proximity to the pacific plate this is extremely rare however due to their nontropical biogeography as well as their inhabitants who have historically been related to indigenous americans st lawrence island in the northern bering sea belongs to alaska and may be associated with either continent but is almost always considered part of north america as with the rat islands in the aleutian chain at their nearest points alaska and russia are separated by only 25 ongoing definition geographical asia is a cultural artifact of european conceptions of the world beginning with the ancient greeks being imposed onto other cultures an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means asia does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents from the time of herodotus a minority of geographers have rejected the threecontinent system europe africa asia on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them for example sir barry cunliffe the emeritus professor of european archeology at oxford argues that europe has been geographically and culturally merely the western excrescence of the continent of asia geographically asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of eurasia with europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass asia europe and africa make up a single continuous landmassafroeurasia except for the suez canaland share a common continental shelf almost all of europe and a major part of asia sit atop the eurasian plate adjoined on the south by the arabian and indian plate and with the easternmost part of siberia east of the chersky range on the north american plate etymology the term asia is believed to originate in the bronze age placename assuwa aššuwa which originally referred only to a portion of northwestern anatolia the term appears in hittite records recounting how a confederation of assuwan states including troy unsuccessfully rebelled against the hittite king tudhaliya i around 1400 bce roughly contemporary linear b documents contain the term asiwia asiwija seemingly in reference to captives from the same area herodotus used the term ἀσία in reference to anatolia and the territory of the persian empire in contrast to greece and egypt he reports that greeks assumed that asia was named after the wife of prometheus but that lydians say it was named after asies son of cotys who passed the name on to a tribe at sardis in greek mythology asia ἀσία or asie ἀσίη was the name of a nymph or titan goddess of lydia the iliad attributed by the ancient greeks to homer mentions two phrygians in the trojan war named asios an adjective meaning asian and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in lydia as ασιος the term was later adopted by the romans who used it in reference to the province of asia located in western anatolia one of the first writers to use asia as a name of the whole continent was pliny history the history of asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions east asia south asia southeast asia central asia and west asia the coastal periphery was home to some of the worlds earliest known civilizations each of them developing around fertile river valleys the civilizations in mesopotamia the indus valley and the yellow river shared many similarities these civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel other innovations such as writing seem to have been developed individually in each area cities states and empires developed in these lowlands the central steppe region had long been inhabited by horsemounted nomads who could reach all areas of asia from the steppes the earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the indoeuropeans who spread their languages into the middle east south asia and the borders of china where the tocharians resided the northernmost part of asia including much of siberia was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads owing to the dense forests climate and tundra these areas remained very sparsely populated the center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts the caucasus and himalaya mountains and the karakum and gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty while the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe however the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force for this and other reasons the nomads who conquered states in china india and the middle east often found themselves adapting to the local more affluent societies the islamic caliphates defeats of the byzantine and persian empires led to west asia and southern parts of central asia and western parts of south asia under its control during its conquests of the 7th century the mongol empire conquered a large part of asia in the 13th century an area extending from china to europe before the mongol invasion song dynasty reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people the black death one of the most devastating pandemics in human history is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central asia where it then travelled along the silk road the russian empire began to expand into asia from the 17th century and would eventually take control of all of siberia and most of central asia by the end of the 19th century the ottoman empire controlled anatolia most of the middle east north africa and the balkans from the mid 16th century onwards in the 17th century the manchu conquered china and established the qing dynasty the islamic mughal empire and the hindu maratha empire controlled much of india in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively western european colonisation of asia coincided with the industrial revolution in the west and the dethroning of india and china as the worlds foremost economies the british empire became dominant in south asia with large parts of the region first being conquered by british traders before falling under direct british rule extreme poverty doubled to over 50 during this era the middle east was contested and partitioned by the british and french while southeast asia was carved up between the british dutch and french various western powers dominated china in what later became known as the century of humiliation with the britishsupported opium trade and later opium wars resulting in china being forced into an unprecedented situation of importing more than it exported foreign domination of china was furthered by the empire of japan which controlled most of east asia and much of southeast asia new guinea and the pacific islands during this era japans domination was enabled by its rapid rise that had taken place during the meiji era of the late 19th century in which it applied industrial knowledge learned from the west and thus overtook the rest of asia with the end of world war ii in 1945 and the wartime ruination of europe and imperial japan many countries in asia were able to rapidly free themselves of colonial rule the independence of india came along with the carving out of a separate nation for the majority of indian muslims which today has become the countries pakistan and bangladesh some arab countries took economic advantage of massive oil deposits that were discovered in their territory becoming globally influential east asian nations along with singapore in southeast asia became economically prosperous with highgrowth tiger economies with china regaining its place among the top two economies of the world by the 21st century india has grown significantly because of economic liberalisation that started in the 1990s with extreme poverty now below 20 geography asia is the largest continent on earth it covers 9 of the earths total surface area or 30 of its land area and has the longest coastline at 62800 asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern fourfifths of eurasia it is located to the east of the suez canal and the ural mountains and south of the caucasus mountains or the kumamanych depression and the caspian and black seas it is bounded on the east by the pacific ocean on the south by the indian ocean and on the north by the arctic ocean asia is subdivided into 49 countries five of them georgia azerbaijan russia kazakhstan and turkey are transcontinental countries lying partly in europe geographically russia is partly in asia but is considered a european nation both culturally and politically the gobi desert is in mongolia and the arabian desert stretches across much of the middle east the yangtze river in china is the longest river in the continent the himalayas between nepal and china is the tallest mountain range in the world tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north main regions there are various approaches to the regional division of asia the following subdivision into regions is used among others by the un statistics agency unsd this division of asia into regions by the united nations is done solely for statistical reasons and does not imply any assumption about political or other affiliations of countries and territories climate asia has extremely diverse climate features climates range from arctic and subarctic in siberia to tropical in southern india and southeast asia it is moist across southeast sections and dry across much of the interior some of the largest daily temperature ranges on earth occur in western sections of asia the monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections due to the presence of the himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer southwestern sections of the continent are hot siberia is one of the coldest places in the northern hemisphere and can act as a source of arctic air masses for north america the most active place on earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the philippines and south of japan climate change climate change is having major impacts on many countries in the continent a survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm maplecroft identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change each nations vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio economic and environmental indicators which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years the asian countries of bangladesh india the philippines vietnam thailand pakistan china and sri lanka were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change some shifts are already occurring for example in tropical parts of india with a semiarid climate the temperature increased by 04 c between 1901 and 2003 a 2013 study by the international crops research institute for the semiarid tropics icrisat aimed to find sciencebased propoor approaches and techniques that would enable asias agricultural systems to cope with climate change while benefiting poor and vulnerable farmers the studys recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weatherbased agroadvisory services to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover replenish groundwater and use renewable energy the ten countries of the association of southeast asian nations asean  brunei cambodia indonesia laos malaysia myanmar the philippines singapore thailand and vietnam  are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change in the world however aseans climate mitigation efforts are not commensurate with the climate threats and risks it faces economy asia has the largest continental economy in the world by both gdp nominal and ppp values and is the fastest growing economic region 2023 china is by far the largest economy on the continent making up nearly half of the continents economy by gdp nominal it is followed by japan india south korea indonesia saudi arabia and turkey which are all ranked amongst the top 20 largest economies both by nominal and ppp values based on global office locations 2011 asia dominated the office locations with 4 of the top 5 being in asia hong kong singapore tokyo and seoul around 68 percent of international firms have an office in hong kong in the late 1990s and early 2000s the economy of china had an average annual growth rate of more than 8 according to economic historian angus maddison india had the worlds largest economy during 1000 bce and 1 ce india was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until 19th century contributing 25 of the worlds industrial output china was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history and shared the mantle with india for several decades in the late twentieth century japan was the largest economy in asia and secondlargest of any single nation in the world after surpassing the soviet union measured in net material product in 1990 and germany in 1968 nb a number of supernational economies are larger such as the european union eu the north american free trade agreement nafta or apec this ended in 2010 when china overtook japan to become the worlds second largest economy it is forecasted that india will overtake japan in terms of nominal gdp by 2027 in the late 1980s and early 1990s japans gdp by currency exchange rates was almost as large as that of the rest of asia combined in 1995 japans economy nearly equaled that of the us as the largest economy in the world for a day after the japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yenus economic growth in asia since world war ii to the 1990s had been concentrated in japan as well as the four regions of south korea taiwan hong kong and singapore located in the pacific rim known as the asian tigers which are now all considered developed economies having amongst the highest gdp per capita in asia asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin and it is rich in natural resources such as petroleum forests fish water rice copper and silver manufacturing in asia has traditionally been strongest in east and southeast asia particularly in china taiwan south korea japan india the philippines and singapore japan and south korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations but increasingly the prc and india are making significant inroads many companies from europe north america south korea and japan have operations in asias developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructuremay 2023 according to citigroup in 2011 9 of 11 global growth generators countries came from asia driven by population and income growth they are bangladesh china india indonesia iraq mongolia the philippines sri lanka and vietnam asia has three main financial centers hong kong tokyo and singapore call centers and business process outsourcing bpos are becoming major employers in india and the philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled englishspeaking workers the increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of india and the china as financial centers due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry india has become a major hub for outsourcingmay 2023 trade between asian countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for asia individual main routes have emerged from this the main route leads from the chinese coast south via hanoi to jakarta singapore and kuala lumpur through the strait of malacca via the sri lankan colombo to the southern tip of india via malé to east africa mombasa from there to djibouti then through the red sea over the suez canal into mediterranean there via haifa istanbul and athens to the upper adriatic to the northern italian hub of trieste with its rail connections to central and eastern europe or further to barcelona and around spain and france to the european northern ports a far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via south africa to europe a particularly significant part of the asian goods traffic is carried out across the pacific towards los angeles and long beach in contrast to the sea routes the silk road via the land route to europe is on the one hand still under construction and on the other hand is much smaller in terms of scope intraasian trade including sea trade is growing rapidly in 2010 asia had 33 million millionaires people with net worth over us1 million excluding their homes slightly below north america with 34 million millionaires in 2011 asia topped europe in number of millionaires citigroup in the wealth report 2012 stated that asian centamillionaire overtook north americas wealth for the first time as the worlds economic center of gravity continued moving east at the end of 2011 there were 18000 asian people mainly in southeast asia china and japan who have at least 100 million in disposable assets while north america with 17000 people and western europe with 14000 people tourism with growing regional tourism with domination of chinese visitors mastercard has released global destination cities index 2013 with 10 of 20 are dominated by asia and pacific region cities and also for the first time a city of a country from asia bangkok set in the topranked with 1598 million international visitors demographics east asia had by far the strongest overall human development index hdi improvement of any region in the world nearly doubling average hdi attainment over the past 40 years according to the reports analysis of health education and income data china the second highest achiever in the world in terms of hdi improvement since 1970 is the only country on the top 10 movers list due to income rather than health or education achievements its per capita income increased a stunning 21fold over the last four decades also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty yet it was not among the regions top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy nepal a south asian country emerges as one of the worlds fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements its present life expectancy is 25 years longer than in the 1970s more than four of every five children of school age in nepal now attend primary school compared to just one in five 40 years ago languages asia is home to several language families and many language isolates most asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken for

around one million about 45 to 50 live in syria 35 to 40 live in lebanon and less than 10 live in israel recently there has been a growing druze diaspora the baháʼí faith originated in asia in iran persia and spread from there to the ottoman empire central asia india and burma during the lifetime of baháulláh since the middle of the 20th century growth has particularly occurred in other asian countries because baháʼí activities in many muslim countries has been severely suppressed by authorities lotus temple is a big baháʼí temple in india indian and east asian religions almost all asian religions have philosophical character and asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings indian philosophy includes hindu philosophy and buddhist philosophy they include elements of nonmaterial pursuits whereas another school of thought from india cārvāka preached the enjoyment of the material world the religions of hinduism buddhism jainism and sikhism originated in india south asia in east asia particularly in china and japan confucianism taoism and zen buddhism took shape 2012 hinduism has around 11 billion adherents the faith represents around 25 of asias population and is the largest religion in asia however it is mostly concentrated in south asia over 80 of the populations of both india and nepal adhere to hinduism alongside significant communities in bangladesh pakistan bhutan sri lanka and bali indonesia many overseas indians in countries such as burma singapore and malaysia also adhere to hinduism buddhism has a great following in mainland southeast asia and east asia buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of cambodia 96 thailand 95 burma 8089 japan 3696 bhutan 7584 sri lanka 70

of china vietnam and north korea are officially atheist thus the number of buddhists and other religious adherents may be underreported jainism is found mainly in india and in overseas indian communities such as the united states and malaysia sikhism is found in northern india and amongst overseas indian communities in other parts of asia especially southeast asia confucianism is found predominantly in mainland china south korea taiwan and in overseas chinese populations taoism is found mainly in mainland china taiwan malaysia and singapore in many chinese communities taoism is

traditions that have been practiced by the various ethnic groups of the continent for centuries the continent is divided into six geographic subregions central asia east asia north asia south asia southeast asia and west asia these regions are defined by their cultural similarities including common religions languages and ethnicities west asia also known as southwest asia or the middle east has cultural roots in the ancient civilizations of the fertile crescent and mesopotamia which gave rise to the persian arab ottoman empires as well as the abrahamic religions of judaism christianity and islam these civilizations which are located in the hilly flanks are among the oldest in the world with evidence of farming dating back to around 9000 bce despite the challenges posed by the vast size of the continent and the presence of natural barriers such as deserts and mountain ranges trade and commerce have helped to create a panasian culture that is shared across the region nobel prizes the

established in 1986 dependent territories in the caribbean aruba ə ə nl or nl pap officially known as the country of aruba land aruba pais aruba is a constituent country within the kingdom of the netherlands situated in the south of the caribbean sea aruba is located approximately 29 north of the venezuelan peninsula of paraguaná and 80 northwest of curaçao aruba measures 32 in length from its northwestern to its southeastern end and is 10 across at its widest point alongside bonaire and curaçao aruba forms a group referred to as the abc islands the dutch caribbean encompasses the abc islands along with the other three dutch substantial islands in the caribbean the sss islands aruba contributes to about onethird of the population of the dutch caribbean in 1986 it became a constituent country within the kingdom of the netherlands and acquired the formal name the country of aruba as one of the four countries in the kingdom of the netherlands alongside the netherlands curaçao and sint maarten aruba shares dutch nationality with its citizens aruba lacks administrative subdivisions but is divided into eight regions for census purposes with oranjestad as its capital in contrast to much of the caribbean which experiences humid tropical climates aruba has a dry climate with an arid xeric landscape the relatively warm and sunny weather persists throughout the year aruba has an area of 179 and a dense population of 108166 as per the 2020 census etymology the name aruba most likely came from the caquetío oruba which means well situated island seeing as it was the caquetío who were present on the island when it was first set foot upon by alonso de ojeda between 1529 and the signing of the treaty of westphalia 1648 the name isla de oruba was used for the island by the spanish after the signing the island was ceded to the dutch and gradually its name changed to aruba there were many different names for aruba used by other amerindian groups all of which could have contributed to the presentday name aruba another caquetío name for the island was oibubia which means guided island the taino name for the island was arubeira the kalinago also had two names for the island ora oubao which means shell island and oirubae which means companion of curaçao a common misconception is that the name aruba came from oro hubo spanish for there was gold once however the spanish declared these islands islas inútiles meaning useless islands due to their lack of mineral wealth it was not until a century later in 1824 that gold was discovered on aruba by a twelveyearold herder named willem rasmijn leading to the aruban gold rush history preceramic age in arubas prehistoric era there were distinct periods the archaic or preceramic and the neoindian or ceramic dabajuroïd period the archaic occupation of aruba continued well into the first millennium ad which is relatively late in compared to other parts of the insular caribbean the archaic lifestyle revolved around a food economy based on fishing hunting and gathering with a strong emphasis on marine resources ceramics were absent as was horticulture and agriculture these people not only chipped stones but also polished and sharpened them weapons and tools were predominantly crafted from stone sharpedged ax blades chisels and knives were commonly used with the knives distinguishable by their elongated shape and flat blades one notable site sero muskita yielded a tool that is older than other archaic age sites on the island the finishing techniques and shape of this tool resembles one found at arikok suggesting a date before approximately 2000 bc the presence of these tools on the island may be due to occasional visits from the mainland in total 33 archaic age sites have been identified on aruba early human migration and cultural exchange during this period the leeward islands maintained connections and engaged in trade with mainland south america particularly with partners in the presentday falcónzulia state in venezuela and possibly the la guajira peninsula venezuelacolombia the specific language group to which they belonged remains uncertain this theory is supported by the discovery of 60 to 70 amerindian cemetery burial grounds in malmok and canashito aruba among these burial sites five are found smaller canashito burial ground and are dated between 100 bc to 100 ad interestingly isotopic research revealed that one of the individuals buried there was not from aruba and had a different diet compared to the other four individuals of aruban origin this finding suggests that early human migration and cultural exchange were already part of the cultural pattern of these archaic indians at an early stage moving forward to a later period the burial site in malmok dates back to the period between 450 and 1000 ad the arubans of that time had a short and stocky physique with adult men averaging 157 in height and women averaging 149 the burial customs offer insight into the social dynamics of the archaic island inhabitants based on the burial patterns it was deduced that they traveled in clans of fifteen to thirty people these groups were led by an adult man who was buried at the center of the cluster his elevated status was emphasized by the presence of several stones marking his grave the rest of the family group was buried around him neoindian period the caquetío the archaic population disappeared from aruba from the archeological record around 950 ad shortly after the arrival of the neoindiancaquetío it is clear that the caquetíos had a superior culture in socioeconomic and technological terms it is possible that the new caquetío indians lived alongside the archaic indians on aruba for a time and that they were ultimately displaced or assimilated arrival of the caquetío in the year 1500 the caquetío people lived on aruba they belonged to the arawak people the origin of arawak civilization a name based on a linguistic classification is located in the central amazon region between 1500 and 500 bc the influence of the arawaks had expanded to the caribbean basin and the guianas between 850 and 1000 ad caquetío indians migrated from western venezuela probably from the paraguaná and guajire peninsulas to the leeward antilles they belonged to the arawakmaipure language family the name caquetío refers to how this group referred to themselves during their first contact with europeans they had longer and narrower skulls than the archaic population and their height was up to 160 the newcomers brought pottery and agriculture to the islands and are therefore classified as part of the neoindian period caquetío chiefdom the area over which the legendary cacique manaure exercised his authority was the coastal region of the current state falcónzulia at venezuela including the paraguaná peninsula as well as aruba curaçao and bonaire the caquetío people had a highly developed process of state formation they had a chiefdom which in human evolution is often a precursor to a kingdom where central leadersparamount chiefscontrolled multiple subordinate politicaladministrative units the emphasis was more on the political and religious alliances between indigenous communities than on the military control or subjugate vast territories at the head of the caquetío chiefdom was a spiritual leader called diao who had both secular and religious authority in modern terms he was endowed with powers that could influence nature a shaman the diao position was hereditary by being allowed to marry multiple wives the diao was able to establish and maintain political alliances with other groups tribes or villages the chiefdom was centralized in its design but not based on authoritarian or violencebased subjugation the spanish conquistador interrupted this process of expansion at the time of the european contact ad 14991535 political units and governance the caquetío territory consisted of several and therefore smaller political units that were under the authority of lower secondtier chiefs who were subordinate to the highest authority how the central authority was exercised over the units is not clear however there are reports from the contact period that suggest the diao did not exert his power over the lower units in arbitrary manner likely there was a form of consultation between the diao and lower leaders in the 16th century two subunits the guaranos and amuayes lived on the paraguaná peninsula aruba which is less than 30 kilometers away from paraguaná was previously connected to one of these units after the diao and the regional subunits such as the mentioned guaranaos an amuayes in paraguaná the village formed the third level of governance in the hierarchy of the chiefdom aruba had not simultaneously five villages three larger ones ceri noca santa cruz tanki flip noord and savaneta and two smaller ones near tanki leendert and parkietenbos which have not yet been systematically studied the location of aruban villages varied they were situated in places where beneficial agriculture land was available and where the most favorable hydrological conditions prevailed such as where several rooi gullies came together and where relatively much water was available agriculture trade and network the caquetío people probably used a shifting cultivation farming method also known as slashandburn the yields from agriculture and fishing were supplemented by engaging in trade of raw materials and artifacts that were not locally available or producible sixteenth century sources indicate that the caquetíos traded in among other things salt canoes tobacco and beads the leeward caquetíos certainly did not live in isolation but formed outlying regions of a dynamic chiefdom with regional trading networks burial practices in 1882 a french explorer named alphonse l pinart documented an account provided by an old aruba indian according to the indians account witnessed at the former indian encampment at saboneta savaneta a native female was inhumed in one of the large conical ollas her body was doubled up inside the vase with the head protruding through the orifice subsequently a smaller urn was placed upside down on the head and the entire burial was covered with earth the caquetío people were buried in clusters both within and potentially outside village boundaries at times there was a secondary burial possibly reserved for exceptional individuals in the primary burial the deceased were buried in a large pot covered with a smaller pot placed on top in a secondary burial the body was initially buried without a pot and after a few months or years the bones were exhumed and reburied in smaller pots for a second time some pots contained grave offerings such as axes shells and pottery remarkably the secondary burial method was practiced until recently in south america the striking similarity between the neoindian burial practices in aruba and the postcolumbian variant in guajira justifies the assumption that the similar beliefs about life after death existed in both societies last indigenous aruban nicolaas pyclas was regarded as the last known indigenous aruban pyclas spoke and understood the extinct language of the original inhabitants of aruba adhering to their way of life and customs he resided in a hut in savonet savaneta his diet included sea snails such as cocolishi cerun uva and carco aliger gigas as well as wild herbs pyclas rejected any involvement in religious practices around 1840 he was found dead hanging from a tree branch not far from his hut estimated to be approximately 50 years old he was buried in situ and was not properly buried due to the hard rocky surface he was only covered with a layer of earth and stones pyclas skull was gifted to the former rijks ethnographisch museum presently national museum of ethnology in leiden with the mediation of aj van koolwijk spanish period new route to india it is known that christopher columbus was not searching for a new continent but for the shortest route to india india had been the spearhead of european trade expansion and the foreign policy of the spanish crown since the travels of marco polo a century earlier india china and japan formed the focal point of medieval ideas about boundless riches cities with houses covered in gold and islands with inexhaustible amounts of spices pearls and silk the suspicion arose that india could be reached via the relatively short route to the west across the ocean of atlantis during his third voyage to the new world columbus was searching for the southern route to india and explored the paria peninsula eastern venezuela and the orinoco region where he discovered the fresh river water of the orinoco delta the suspicion arose that he had not found islands off the coast of india but a much more extensive land mass an extension of asia columbus did not realize that this was an unknown continent characteristic of his christian medieval attitude columbus solved the puzzle by assuming that he had discovered the earthly paradise the earthly paradise was inaccessible to humans without gods permission columbus experienced the geographical discovery of the new world in christian terms and assigned himself a special role assigned by a divine power with the discovery of the americas the myths of the golden age atlantis and the earthly paradise moved from asia to the new world he died on may 20 1506 believing that he had found new islands of the coast of or possibly a peninsula of indiapreislands antilha these antilhas were inhabited by peoples whom he called indians early explorations in 1500 juan de la cosa drew the first map of the new world which depicted the two leeward antilles known at the time this was followed by the more accurate cantino map created anonymously in 1502 which also showed an extensive landmass and mentioned the isla do gigante island of giants and isla do brasil island of brasil the location of the isla do gigante southwest of the isla do brasil suggest that it refers to bonaire and curaçao since aruba is located more to the northwest in 1493 the year in which the west indian islands became known in europe the division between the secular civil and religious authorities in the new world had to be arranged the newly appointed spanish pope alexander vi issued the inter caetera bull granting the spanish crown sovereignty over the newly discovered territories and the responsibility of the holy task to send good godfearing men who are earned and capable to those islands and continents to teach the natives living there about the catholic faith and instill in them good habits in exchange for the papal approval of the treaty spain promised to vigorously carry out missionary work in the discovered territories this gave spain the right to evangelize the americas and appoint and dismiss priests blurring the separation between church and state in the region in other words the spanish crown was granted significant religious authority in the americas which was not strictly separate from the state and weakened the distinction between the religious and secular spheresa key aspect of separation between church and state the conquistador humanity experienced a devastating genocide as the conquistadors were fascinated by legends of inexhaustible gold reserves of el dorado and violently imposed the authority culture and values of the old world europeans over the new world indigenous societies the conquest was characterized by bloodshed destruction and forced assimilation of the native peoples into european society such as the initiation of indian slavery by columbus in 1492 europeans had an advantage because they had superior weapons such as firearms steel swords armor ships horses and targeted military strategies while expedition leaders mostly came from the higher echelons of late medieval society their foot soldiers were usually from the lower middle class of southern europe these soldiers formed the basis of the future group of encomenderos the encomienda system granted spanish colonizers right by the spanish crown to extract tribute and labor from indigenous peoples for example indigenous communities had to give up a portion of the yields from their agricultural or farm land known as conucos in taino as a form of taxation and to provide for the food supply of the colonists the defeated were often kidnapped and forced to participate in expeditions elsewhere in the new world as slave laborers the caquetío population of the leeward antilles was incorporated into the spanish colonial empire 1500 on june 8 and 10 1501 alonso de ojeda acquired the exclusive right to exploit the current venezuelan coastal area known as coquibacoa and the islands of the coast curaçao aruba and bonaire and probably also the mongues and aves islands de ojeda had to form an administration as far west as possible on the tierra firme to secure the spanish presence it is believed that de ojeda and amerigo vespucci visited bonaire and curaçao but neither vespucci nor de ojeda are thought to have set foot on aruban soil he was explicitly forbidden to enslave natives however de ojeda lacked administrative skills and intentions and he became a controversial figure de ojeda established a base named santa cruz at the tip of guajira from where he conducted trade and probably even more importantly carried out his raids including slave hunts during his third voyage to the new world in 1502 de ojeda visited curaçao but his attempt to exploit the region failed instead bartolomé de las casas documented de ojedas raids slave hunts and atrocities in the rural areas of presentday cartagena in his book historia general de las indias these raids were disastrous even for the spaniards and marked the end of the first attempt to control the region upon returning to spain in 1504 de ojeda was brought to trial to account for his failed venture and the atrocities he had committed de ojeda lost his case and the court stripped him of his earthly possessions and the rights to exploit the region de ojeda died in 1515 or 1516 impoverished in a franciscan monastery in hispaniola as a sign of his forced simplicity he was buried in the entrance of the monastery between 1513 and 1515 the leeward antilles including curaçao aruba and bonaire were depopulated captain diego salazar led this effort which affected an estimated 2000 indigenous inhabitants from these islands and likely more from tierra firme most of the caquetío were taken to hispaniola as forced laborers many of them likely died on the way or later in the gold mines by the spanish colonizers or during the devastating smallpox epidemic of 1518 later on new indians migrated from the mainland to aruba while indians were brought to curaçao by juan de ampiés the indigenous population was under encomienda which ended the autonomy of caquetío community in the islands their relatives on the mainland did not fare any better after an unsuccessful attempt by bartolomé de las casas to convert the local population to christianity the coastal region of the mainland was leased to the banking firm of the welsers in 1528 this led to the violent conquest of the caquetío kingdom before 1634 curaçao along with its neighboring islands bonaire and aruba were considered part of the province of venezuela they had been separated from venezuela only during the during the period of the welser grant the appropriation of the caribbean region turned out to be a failure for the spaniards the exploitation of the west indian islands proved unprofitable and gold mining on hispaniola and puerto rico declined spanish settlers moved elsewhere and in 1569 the spanish crown banned settlement on the caribbean islands by royal decree this measure that did not apply to the leased islands of curaçao aruba and bonaire the colonization of the large caribbean islands such as cuba was encouraged while the small islands were abandoned most of the islands remained largely uncontrolled and undefended making them a potential opportunity for northwestern european countries that wanted to break spains monopoly on colonizing the new world england france the netherlands and denmark explored the possibilities of piracy and trade on the caribbean islands on the continent the great empires declined but indigenous societies continued to exist and were exposed to a long process of miscegenation in the falcónzulia province among other places caquetío societies survived on tierra firme although their cultures and social structures were largely destroyed by the spaniards on the former caquetío coastal islands of aruba curaçao and trinidad indigenous people lived well into the colonial period the indigenous history of the guajira peninsula extends to the present day the wayú are increasingly being recognized on the leeward antilles as possible contemporary ancestors or lost relatives from prehistoric times spanish ranch the conquistadors brought not only people but also european cattle to aruba over time they also introduced goats sheep dogs donkeys cows pigs and possibly even cats its believed that rabbits brought by the dutch later became wild on the island aruba essentially became a spanish ranch with cattle roaming freely in search of food despite more trees in the past the overall vegetation was similar to today the horses introduced here were lighter than dutch ones and their hooves became so hard from roaming freely that they didnt need horseshoes to avoid stallions injuring each other during mating battles horseshoes were impractical after three weeks of service particularly in the dry season the horses were released to recover occasionally a small group of spaniards would disembark on the island but typically aruba was left to fend for itself according to de laet in 1630 there were few indians and some spaniards on aruba early dutch period dutch conquest salt the dutch were compelled to venture into forbidden waters of the caribbean known as spains mare clausum due to their need for salt in open defiance of phillip ii  since the mid15th century the prosperous dutch herring industry had been steadily expanding the west frisian towns of hoorn enkhuizen and medemblik were particularly active in the salt trade thanks to their thriving fishing industries herring was a crucial commodity for dutch commerce requiring salt for preservation salt also played a vital role in the butter and cheese industry as well as in preserving food during long voyages the curing or pickling process for herring was wellestablished during the middle ages after catching the herring the packers would remove the internal organs mix them with salt to create a brine and pack them in barrels along with additional salt while zeeland was not heavily involved in fishing they were renowned for their salt whitening process which was highly sought after throughout europe during the 1400s shipbuilders in the low countries created a new type of fishing vessel called the herring buss specifically designed for deepsea fishing these busses proved to be significantly more effective than the smaller flatbottom commonly used for coastal fishing as time went on and the early 16th century approached the buss underwent modifications evolving into threemasted ship with distinctively curved bows salt importation began in the 15th century when the dutch discovered highquality salt in setúbal the iberian coast this sea salt was perfect for preserving herring because of its magnesium sulfate and magnesium chloride content it was also more affordable than domestic salt which was produced by burning peat from coastal bogs infused with sea salt over the centuries the dutch obtained salt from setúbal by trading goods from the baltic sea region however the eighty years war which started in 1585 prompted phillip ii to halt this trade with the salt supply cut off the dutch were forced to seek new trade routes their quest for salt led them as far south as the isla de mayo and isla de sal the cape verde islands until 1598 eventually expanding to the west indies shortages of salt in cape verde combined with unsafe conditions under the spanish rule compelled the dutch to venture across the atlantic seeking alternative sources they initially explored brazil but abandoned it due to inadequate saltpans they then turned their attention to punta de araya in tierra firme before the 17th century the salt reserves in punta de araya had been largely untouched by the spaniards with numerous accessible pans spread along the coast and islands while the iberians were primarily attracted to the area for its pearls the salt in punta de araya was abundant and of high quality surpassing that of the iberian peninsula rather than being a rock salt deposit it was a gem salt derived from the clay of the surrounding hills however following the truce of twelve years the dutch discovered that the spaniards had fortified the saltpans forcing them to give up their stake in araya salt after hostilities resumed the dutch established the west india company wic with the main objective of engaging in strategic military actions and privateering organization against spain this was the raison dêtre or reason for the existence of the wic their secondary objective was focused on commerce and colonization a choice that ultimately led to the downfall of the wic in 1674 the wic also gathered information on spanish treasure fleets in 1623 the first official fleet of the new wic a small squadron of only three ships commanded by pieter schouten set sail for the caribbean to engage in looting and plundering in the lesser antilles and the yucátan peninsula it was during this voyage that the dutch first encountered aruba the dutch herring production reached its peak in the seventeenth century earning it the nickname gold mine of the republic by the dutch government in 1624 around 1628 or 1629 the dutch started obtaining salt regularly on tortuga governor francisco núñez melián of venezuela destroyed the saltpans and took some dutch prisoners forced them to cut brazilwood in curaçao one of these dutchmen jan janszoon otzen carefully assessed the islands excellent harbor and profitable saltpans which he later communicated to the wic recognizing their struggle for salt the dutch realized the need to establish a base in these waters to secure curaçao johannes van walbeeck a renowned company agent with a commendable record in brazil was appointed as the expeditions commander and future governor of curaçao bonaire and aruba curaçao was captured and acquired by the wic in june 1634 primarily by their desire to obtain salt in van walbeecks report of 1634 aruba is mentioned only in relation to curaçao where he refers to bonaire and aruba collectively as the islands of curaçao spain had another reason to regret its past neglect of the islas inútiles usless islands as they came under control of foreign invaders disputing spains arrogant claims however the dutch were dissatisfied with the available salt supply the natural salt pans were inadequate and their attempts to create an artificial one at the entrance of sint ann bay were a complete failure although the salt pans in bonaire showed more potential they never developed into a major salt trading center in 1816 aruba possessed seven salt pans all of which yielded salt of subpar quality the salt production was just sufficient to meet the local demand aruban laborers often assisted by donkeys were tasked with gathering the salt which was subsequently distributed among the islands inhabitants around 1924 salt extraction at rancho had limited benefits primarily being used in the preservation of fish during shipping paardenbaai horses bay contained salt pans up until 1949 when it was dredged and disappeared beneath the sand 16481687 between the peace of westphalia in 1648 and the peace of nijmegen in 1678 there were 30 years of crisis in the dutch antilles and the entire caribbean region by 1648 curaçao had lost its importance as a military outpost governor peter stuyvesant had a plan to strengthen the connections between the islands and new netherland he believed that the two colonies could support each other new netherland would provide food in exchange for slaves from curaçao horses from aruba and salt from bonaire but stuyvesant didnt anticipate the rivalry between the two colonies which prevented them from working together effectively the dutch in curaçao preferred to sell their goods to other caribbean islands where they could get a better price rather than trading with their fellow countrymen in new netherland additionally the islands were involved in illegal trade with the spanish mainland and didnt want to switch to legal trade with new netherland governor stuyvesant needed slaves to strengthen new amsterdams defenses but he mostly received old or sick slaves called mancarrons in response to his requests the better slaves were sold elsewhere to the highest bidder however the people in new netherland werent motivated by unselfish reasons or a strong sense of patriotism they continued to trade with their french english and swedish neighbors across the border only in extreme situations did their shared heritage become more important than making money for example when the islands faced famine due to a series of dry seasons stuyvesant came to the rescue by sending a ship with food just in time the troubled relationship between the curaçao islands and new netherland came to a sudden end in 1664 at that time even though a war between england and the united provinces hadnt been officially declared yet an english fleet led by richard nicolls demanded that new amsterdam surrender while the dutch briefly regained control of the colony in 1673 it was once again used as leverage in 1674 to show the english the dangers of their alliance with france during the 17th century the dutch considered england their main adversary as evidenced by the three wars they fought against the english unlike the first anglodutch war 16521654 the second anglodutch war 16651667 had a longlasting impact in the caribbean in the end the second anglodutch war and the subsequent peace treaty in 1667 marked a pivotal moment in caribbean colonial possessions dutch supremacy waned and the enforcement of english navigation acts left a lasting impact on regional trade nevertheless the caribbean islands eventually regained stability and prosperity experiencing fewer changes in colonial holdings for centuries to come slavery in the 16th century spaniards engaged in coercive labor practices deporting arawak indians to hispaniola in 1515 colonists exerted control over indians on the useless islands mirroring the hardships of these faced by subsequent african slaves marked by a denial of freedom and forced labor after 1775 is when the names of african slaves began appearing in records with examples such as cecilia and apolinar tied to families like silvester and alvarez from alto vista near the coast the dutch colonizer recognized red slavery particularly of indians captured in wars in the guyanas indians taken as prisoners in conflicts were traded even following peace treaties though indians on aruba werent officially classified as slaves during the west india companys rule oral tradition in aruba mentioned amerindian slaves in the early 20th century father paul brenneker noted their presence in curaçao as pseudoslaves in 1827 commander simon plats found 51 amerindians treated as pseudoslaves by aruban families some were brought by shipowners involved in the slave trade plats had masters sign a declaration recognizing the freedom of the amerindians ensuring proper upbringing education and accommodation contrary to common belief aruba had a history of slavery challenging the notion that conditions were considerably better than in other caribbean regions records are limited with mentions primarily concerning curaçao in 1750 and 1795 arubas circumstances surrounding slavery were comparatively less severe leading to misconceptions that indigenous people were not enslaved however by 1862 15 percent of arubas population were slaves with 27 percent in bonaire a population report from 1820 indicates 331 slaves in aruba157 indigenous people and 174 of african descent in 1840 the number increased to 497 slaves with 269 being indigenous people and 228 of african descent approximately half of arubas slaves were of indigenous origin and the other half were of african descent although dutch law generally prohibited the enslavement of indigenous people the actual practice varied english interregnum and economic development the british empire took control of the island during the napoleonic wars holding it from 1806 to 1816 after which it was returned to dutch authority in accordance with the anglodutch treaty of 1814 aruba was then integrated into the colony of curaçao and dependencies along with bonaire throughout the 19th century the islands economy evolved centered around gold phosphate aruba phosphate company and the aloe vera industry royal aruba aloe however despite these economic activities aruba continued to be a relatively underdeveloped and economically disadvantaged region during this period 20th and 21st centuries the first oil refinery lago oil and transport company in san nicolas was built in 1924 and a subsidiary of standard oil esso the refinery on aruba grew to become one of the largest in the world in 1927 the arend petroleum company was established to the west of the capital city of oranjestad and was commonly called the eagle the refineries processed crude oil from the vast venezuelan oil fields bringing greater prosperity to the island during world war ii the netherlands was occupied by nazi germany in 1940 the oil facilities in aruba came under the administration of the dutch governmentinexile in london causing them to be attacked by the german navy in 1942 in august 1947 aruba formulated its first staatsreglement constitution for arubas status aparte as an autonomous state within the kingdom of the netherlands prompted by the efforts of henny eman a noted aruban politician by 1954 the charter of the kingdom of the netherlands was established providing a framework for relations between aruba and the rest of the kingdom that created the netherlands antilles which united all of the dutch colonies in the caribbean into one administrative structure many arubans were unhappy with the arrangement however as the new policy was perceived as being dominated by curaçao in 1972 at a conference in suriname betico croes a politician from aruba proposed the creation of a dutch commonwealth of four states aruba the netherlands suriname and the netherlands antilles each to have its own nationality backed by his newly created party the movimiento electoral di pueblo croes sought greater autonomy for aruba with the longterm goal of independence adopting the trappings of an independent state in 1976 with the creation of a flag and national anthem in march 1977 a referendum was held with the support of the united nations 82 of the participants voted for complete independence from the netherlands tensions mounted as croes stepped up the pressure on the dutch government by organising a general strike in 1977 croes later met with dutch prime minister joop den uyl with the two sides agreeing to assign the institute of social studies in the hague to prepare a study for independence entitled aruba en onafhankelijkheid achtergronden modaliteiten en mogelijkheden een rapport in eerste aanleg aruba and independence backgrounds modalities and opportunities a preliminary report 1978 autonomy in march 1983 aruba reached an official agreement within the kingdom for its independence to be developed in a series of steps as the crown granted increasing autonomy in august 1985 aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved on 1 january 1986 after elections were held for its first parliament aruba seceded from the netherlands antilles officially becoming a country of the kingdom of the netherlands with full independence planned for 1996 however croes was seriously injured in a traffic accident in 1985 slipping into a coma he died in 1986 never seeing the enacting of status aparte for aruba for which he had worked over many years after his death croes was proclaimed libertador di aruba croes successor henny eman of the aruban peoples party avp became the first prime minister of aruba in 1985 arubas oil refinery had closed it had provided aruba with 30 percent of its real income and 50 percent of government revenue the significant blow to the economy led to a push for a dramatic increase in tourism and that sector has expanded to become the islands largest industry at a convention in the hague in 1990 at the request of arubas prime minister nelson oduber the governments of aruba the netherlands and the netherlands antilles postponed indefinitely arubas transition to full independence the article scheduling arubas complete independence was rescinded in 1995 although it was decided that the process could be revived after another referendum geography geography of aruba aruba is located 77 km 48 mi west of curaçao and 29 km 18 mi north of paraguaná peninsula of venezuela aruba showcases three distinct landscapes the northwestern region is primarily characterized by flat batholith landscapes notable landmarks here include the conical hooiberg hill and rock formations like ayo and casibari moreover the northeastern part of the island features the oldest formations known as the aruba lava formation alf this region is marked by rolling hills including jamanota and is home to arikok national park and lastly the limestone terraces surround these two landscapes the lowlying limestone terrace regions are defined by their white sandy beaches and the high plateaus on the north side of the island in contrast are constantly battered by the rough waters of the ocean featuring caves and small natural bridge formations the arid landscape in aruba is not solely a product of its climate but is also a consequence of extensive deforestation and exploitation during the spanish colonization of the island consequently certain crops such as aloe vera thrive in this environment due to the high calciumrich soil known as liming as of 2022 aruba only has 23 of forestcovered land area and only 05 of protected natural area additionally arubas geography includes naturally formed rooi or gullies that channel rainwater towards dams and ultimately the ocean other than arikok national park bubaliplas also known as the bubali bird sanctuary is the only significant body of water on the island that holds the status of protected nature reserve and serves as a brackish water lagoon located in the bubali district of noord regions aruba is divided into eight regions for census purposes with no administrative function some correspond to parishes and include several community facilities flora and fauna arubas flora distinguishes itself from the typical tropical island vegetation the landscape is characterized by common xeric scrublands featuring various cacti thorny shrubs and evergreen plants notably aloe vera is also found on the island and its economic significance has led to its inclusion on the coat of arms of aruba cacti such as melocactus and opuntia are part of arubas landscape with species like opuntia stricta being prominent additionally droughttolerant trees like caesalpinia coriaria and vachellia tortuosa are present the isolation of aruba from the south america mainland contributed to the evolution of multiple endemic species the island provides a habitat for unique wildlife including the endemic aruban whiptail aruba rattlesnake as well as subspecies of aruban burrowing owl and brownthroated parakeet climate and natural hazards according the köppen climate classification aruba is characterized by a hot semiarid climate köppen bsh characterized by limited rainfall totaling just 500 annually notably aruba remains drier even during its supposed rainy season the arid landscape is a direct result of the limited rainfall shaping the islands predominantly arid environment in oranjestad mean monthly temperatures remain consistently moderate with little variation low diurnal temperature variation ranging from 270 to 296 this temperature stability is moderated by the constant trade winds originating from the northeast sweeping in from the atlantic ocean oranjestad experiences an annual rainfall barely exceeding 450 its important to note the high variability in arubas rainfall ranging from as little as 150 during strong el niño years eg 19111912 19301931 19821983 19971998 to over 1000 in la niña years such as 19331934 19701971 or 19881989 an exception to the general aridity is observed during the short rainy season from september to january during this period the southward retreat of the intertropical convergence zone leads to more frequent moist northeasterly winds aruba is positioned south of the typical latitudes of hurricanes and generally avoids the direct impact of these storms however in late 2020 the island was affected by two hurricanes in their early stages 2020 atlantic hurricane season demographics in terms of country of birth the population is estimated to be 66 aruban 91 colombian 43 dutch 51 dominican 32 venezuelan 22 curaçaoan 15 haitian 12 surinamese 11 peruvian 11 chinese 62 from other backgrounds in terms of cultural and ethnic background the population is estimated to be 787 dutch 66 colombian 55 venezuelan 28 dominican 13 haitian and 51 from other backgrounds 2020 aruba has a strong arawak heritage compared to most caribbean islands although there are no fullblooded aboriginals remaining the islanders features clearly reflect their genetic arawak heritage the majority of the population is descended from caquetío african slaves and dutch settlers and to a lesser extent various other groups that have settled on the island over time including the spanish portuguese english french and sephardic jews the population of aruba has experienced fluctuations between 1972 and 2022 primarily influenced by net migration while there have been periods of growth there have also been declines especially during economic challenges notably between 1988 and 2016 the population nearly doubled however in 2017 a decline occurred breaking almost three decades of continuous growth the pandemic years 20202022 also contributed to a population decrease mainly due to reduced births and immigration as of the first quarter in 2023 arubas population stood at 107354 people marking a modest 02 growth compared to the previous year this increase was driven by a significant rise in immigration which saw a 204 percent uptick language roman catholicism is the dominant religion followed by approximately 75 of the population in addition to catholicism there is a diverse range of religions practiced in aruba including protestantism islam hinduism judaism and spiritual beliefs of the indigenous people eg african diaspora reigions santería or brua shrine the lourdes grotto named after the famous french religious pilgrimage site was constructed in 1958 by a priest named erkamp and his parishioners this shrine is nestled into the rocks of seroe preto just off the main road to san nicolas inside the cave there is a 700 statue of the virgin mary easily visible from the main road each year on february 11 the feast of lady lourdes a procession departs from st theresita church in san nicolas and heads to the grotto where a mass is held government along with the netherlands curaçao and sint maarten aruba is a constituent country of the kingdom of the netherlands with internal autonomy matters such as foreign affairs and defense are handled by the netherlands arubas politics take place within a framework of a 21member staten parliament and an eightmember cabinet the statens 21 members are elected by direct popular vote to serve a fouryear term the governor of aruba is appointed for a sixyear term by the monarch and the prime minister and deputy prime minister are indirectly elected by the staten for fouryear terms aruba was formerly a part of the nowdissolved netherlands antilles however it separated from that entity in 1986 gaining its own constitutionaruba is designated as a member of the overseas countries and territories oct and is thus officially not a part of the european union though aruba can and does receive support from the european development fund politics the aruban legal system is based on the dutch model in aruba legal jurisdiction lies with the gerecht in eerste aanleg court of first instance on aruba the gemeenschappelijk hof van justitie van aruba curaçao sint maarten en van bonaire sint eustatius en saba joint court of justice of aruba curaçao sint maarten and of bonaire sint eustatius and saba and the hoge raad der nederlanden supreme court of justice of the netherlands the korps politie aruba aruba police force is the islands law enforcement agency and operates district precincts in oranjestad noord san nicolaas and santa cruz where it is headquartered divergent legal protections from the rest of the kingdom of the netherlands include not being part of the law enforcement council raad van de rechtshandhaving which is a legal entity based on the kingdom act of the july 7 2010 the kingdom act on the law enforcement council being the only country in the kingdom of the netherlands that does not have an ombudsman deficit spending has been a staple in arubas history and modestly high inflation has been present as well by 2006 the governments debt had grown to 1883 billion aruban florins in 2006 the aruban government changed several tax laws to reduce the deficit direct taxes have been converted to indirect taxes as proposed by the imf foreign relations aruba is one of the overseas countries and territories oct of the european union and maintains economic and cultural relations with the european union and the united states aruba is also a member of several international organizations such as the international monetary fund and interpol military defence on aruba is the responsibility of the kingdom of the netherlands the dutch armed forces that protect the island include the navy marine corps and the coastguard including a platoon sized national guard all forces are stationed at marines base in savaneta furthermore in 1999 the us department of defense established a forward operating location fol at the airport education historically dutch was not widely spoken on the island except within colonial administration and its usage increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries students in curaçao aruba and bonaire were predominantly taught in spanish until the late 18th century in aruba dutch serves as the primary language of instruction with papiamento taught as a subject in the lower grades of secondary education arubas educational system mirrors the dutch education structure with public national education financed by the government of aruba the education landscape includes a mix of public and private institutions such as the international school of aruba the schakel college and primarily the colegio arubano in addition to the national education system aruba hosts three medical schools american university school of medicine aruba ausoma aureus university school of medicine and xavier university school of medicine the island also has its own national university the university of aruba economy the islands economy is dominated by four main industries tourism aloe export petroleum refining and offshore banking aruba has one of the highest standards of living in the caribbean region the gdp per capita ppp for aruba was estimated to be 37500 in 2017 its main trading partners are colombia the united states venezuela and the netherlands the agriculture and manufacturing sectors are fairly minimal gold mining was important in the 19th century aloe was introduced to aruba in 1840 but did not become a big export until 1890 cornelius eman founded aruba aloe balm and over time the industry became very important to the economy at one point twothirds of the island was covered in aloe vera fields and aruba became the largest exporter of aloe in the world the industry continues today though on a smaller scale access to biocapacity in aruba is much lower than world average in 2016 aruba had 057 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory much less than the world average of 16 global hectares per person in 2016 aruba used 65 global hectares of biocapacity per person  their ecological footprint of consumption this means they use almost 12 times the biocapacity that aruba contains this is the extent of arubas biocapacity deficit the official exchange rate of the aruban florin is pegged to the us dollar at afl 180 to us100 this fact and the majority of tourists being us means businesses of hotel and resort districts prefer to bank and trade with the consumer in us dollars aruba is a prosperous country unemployment is low although the government has not published statistics since 2013 and per capita income is one of the highest in the caribbean approximately 24087 at the end of 2018 the labor force participation rate was 566 for women until the mid1980s arubas main industry was oil refining then the refinery was shut down and the islands economy shifted towards tourism currently aruba receives about 1235673 2007 guests per year of which threequarters are americans tourism is mainly focused on the beaches and the sea the refinery has been closed and restarted repeatedly during the last decades in recent years a letter of intent was signed with citgo the us subsidiary of the venezuelan state oil company pdvsa to explore the possibility of reopening the refinery again until 2009 the netherlands granted development aid to aruba this aid was mainly for law enforcement education administrative development health care and sustainable economic development this aid was discontinued at arubas request in 2009 since 2015 however a form of financial supervision has been reintroduced because arubas debt has risen sharply to over 80 of gdp aruba also has two free trade zones barcadera and bushiri where import and export and the movement of services are taxfree tourism aruba has a large and welldeveloped tourism industry receiving 1082000 tourists who stayed overnight in its territory in 2018 about 3 of the aruban gross national product is earned through tourism and related activities most tourists are from north america with a marketshare of 733 followed by latin america with 152 and europe with 83 in 2018 there were 40231 visitors from the netherlands for private aircraft passengers bound for the united states the united states department of homeland security dhs us customs and border protection cbp has a full preclearance facility since 1 february 2001 when queen beatrix airport expanded since 2008 aruba has been the only island to have this service for private flights culture aruba boasts a diverse culture according to the bureau burgelijke stand en bevolkingsregister bbsb civil registry and population register in 2005 the island was home to people from ninetytwo different nationalities dutch influence is still evident in traditions like the celebration of sinterklaas saint nicholas on december 5 and 6 as well as national holidays like april 27 when aruba along with the rest of the kingdom of the netherlands celebrates koningsdag kings day or dia di rey in papiamento is celebrated on 18 march aruba celebrates its national anthem and flag day christmas and new years eve are celebrated with the typical music and songs of gaitas for christmas and the dande aruba for new year traditional food and drinks like ayaca ponche crema ham and more are also parts of the festive season january 25 is dedicated to celebrating betico croes day while june 24 is the day for dia di san juan in addition to christmas religious holidays such as the feast of the ascension and good friday are also observed on the island arubas carnaval is a significant cultural event akin to celebrations in other caribbean and latin american countries it began in the 1950s influenced by residents from venezuela and nearby islands curaçao st vincent trinidad barbados st maarten and anguilla who worked at the oil refinery the carnaval celebrations now spans from early january until the tuesday before ash wednesday featuring a grand parade on the final sunday of the festivities aruba has seen an increased influence of american culture due to rising tourism from the united states this is evident in the adoption of american celebrations like halloween in october and thanksgiving day in november architecture from the beginning of the colonization of the netherlands until the beginning of the 20th century the architecture in the most inhabited areas of aruba was influenced by the dutch colonial style and also some spanish elements from the catholic missionaries present in aruba who later settled in venezuela as well after the boom of the oil industry and the tourist sector in the 20th century the architectural style of the island incorporated a more american and international influence in addition elements of the art deco style can still be seen in several buildings in san nicolas therefore it can be said that the islands architecture is a mixture of spanish dutch american and caribbean influences infrastructure arubas queen beatrix international airport is near oranjestad aruba has four ports barcadera the main cargo port paardenbaai the cruise ship

continental congress philadelphia in the american revolution political charters united states documents york pennsylvania the articles of confederation and perpetual union was an agreement among the 13 states of the united states formerly the thirteen colonies that served as the nations first frame of government it was debated by the second continental congress at independence hall in philadelphia between july 1776 and november 1777 and finalized by the congress on november 15 1777 it came into force on march 1 1781 after being ratified by all 13 colonial states a guiding principle of the articles was the establishment and preservation of the independence and sovereignty of the states the articles consciously established a weak central government affording it only those powers the former colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament the document provided clearly written rules for how the states league of friendship known as the perpetual union would be organized while waiting for all states to ratify the congress observed the articles as it conducted business directing the war effort conducting diplomacy with foreign states addressing territorial issues and dealing with native american relations little changed procedurally once the articles of confederation went into effect as ratification did little more than constitutionalize what the continental congress had been doing that body was renamed the congress of the confederation but most americans continued to call it the continental congress since its organization remained the same as the confederation congress attempted to govern the continually growing us states its delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government such as in assembling delegates raising funds and regulating commerce rendered it ineffective at doing so as the governments weaknesses became apparent especially after shays rebellion some prominent political thinkers in the fledgling union began asking for changes to the articles their hope was to create a stronger government initially in september 1786 some states met to address interstate protectionist trade barriers between them shortly thereafter as more states became interested in meeting to revise the articles a meeting was set in philadelphia on may 25 1787 this became the constitutional convention delegates quickly agreed that the defects of the frame of government could not be remedied by altering the articles and so went beyond their mandate by replacing it with a new constitution on march 4 1789 the government under the articles was replaced with the federal government under the constitution the new constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive the president courts and taxing powers background and context the political push to increase cooperation among the thenloyal colonies began with the albany congress in 1754 and benjamin franklins proposed albany plan an intercolonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems over the next two decades some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen others would weaken especially in the degree of loyalty or lack thereof owed the crown civil disobedience resulted in coercive and quelling measures such as the passage of what the colonials referred to as the intolerable acts in the british parliament and armed skirmishes which resulted in dissidents being proclaimed rebels these actions eroded the number of crown loyalists tories among the colonials and together with the highly effective propaganda campaign of the patriot leaders caused an increasing number of colonists to begin agitating for independence from the mother country in 1775 with events outpacing communications the second continental congress began acting as the provisional government for the united colonies it was an era of constitution writingmost states were busy at the taskand leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution a rulebook for how the new nation should function during the war congress exercised an unprecedented level of political diplomatic military and economic authority it adopted trade restrictions established and maintained an army issued fiat money created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments to transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it in early 1776 thomas paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of common sense that the custom of nations demanded a formal declaration of american independence if any european power were to mediate a peace between the americans and great britain the monarchies of france and spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch foreign courts needed to have american grievances laid before them persuasively in a manifesto which could also reassure them that the americans would be reliable trading partners without such a declaration paine concluded the custom of all courts is against us and will be so until by an independence we take rank with other nations beyond improving their existing association the records of the second continental congress show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations on june 7 1776 richard henry lee introduced a resolution before the continental congress declaring the colonies independent at the same time he also urged congress to resolve to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign alliances and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the declaration a model treaty and the articles of confederation the declaration announced the states entry into the international system the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states and the articles of confederation which established a firm league among the thirteen free and independent states constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs drafting on june 12 1776 a day after appointing the committee of five to prepare a draft of the declaration of independence the second continental congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 with one representative from each colony to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states the committee was made up of the following individuals the committee met frequently and chairman john dickinson presented their results to the congress on july 12 1776 afterward there were long debates on such issues as state sovereignty the exact powers to be given to congress whether to have a judiciary western land claims and voting procedures to further complicate work on the constitution congress was forced to leave philadelphia twice for baltimore maryland in the winter of 1776 and later for lancaster then york pennsylvania in the fall of 1777 to evade advancing british troops even so the committee continued with its work the final draft of the articles of confederation and perpetual union was completed on november 15 1777 consensus was achieved by including language guaranteeing that each state retained its sovereignty leaving the matter of western land claims in the hands of the individual states including language stating that votes in congress would be en bloc by state and establishing a unicameral legislature with limited and clearly delineated powers ratification the articles of confederation was submitted to the states for ratification in late november 1777 the first state to ratify was virginia on december 16 1777 12 states had ratified the articles by february 1779 14 months into the process the lone holdout maryland refused to go along until the landed states especially virginia had indicated they were prepared to cede their claims west of the ohio river to the union it would be two years before the maryland general assembly became satisfied that the various states would follow through and voted to ratify during this time congress observed the articles as its de facto frame of government maryland finally ratified the articles on february 2 1781 congress was informed of marylands assent on march 1 and officially proclaimed the articles of confederation to be the law of the land the several states ratified the articles of confederation on the following dates article summaries the articles of confederation contain a preamble thirteen articles a conclusion and a signatory section the individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the confederations central government under the articles the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national congress which was empowered to make war and peace negotiate diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries and to resolve disputes between the states the document also stipulates that its provisions shall be inviolably observed by every state and that the union shall be perpetual summary of the purpose and content of each of the 13 articles congress under the articles army under the articles congress had the authority to regulate and fund the continental army but it lacked the power to compel the states to comply with requests for either troops or funding this left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding supplies and even food further although the articles enabled the states to present a unified front when dealing with the european powers as a tool to build a centralized warmaking government they were largely a failure historian bruce chadwick wrote phelps wrote the continental congress before the articles were approved had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life however congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation and as the war wound down after the victory at yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor no progress was made in congress during the winter of 178384 general henry knox who would later become the first secretary of war under the constitution blamed the weaknesses of the articles for the inability of the government to fund the army the army had long been supportive of a strong union knox wrote as congress failed to act on the petitions knox wrote to gouverneur morris four years before the philadelphia convention was convened as the present constitution is so defective why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so that is to have a convention of the states to form a better constitution once the war had been won the continental army was largely disbanded a very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against native american attacks meanwhile each of the states had an army or militia and 11 of them had navies the wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met in 1783 george washington defused the newburgh conspiracy but riots by unpaid pennsylvania veterans forced congress to leave philadelphia temporarily the congress from time to time during the revolutionary war requisitioned troops from the states any contributions were voluntary and in the debates of 1788 the federalists who supported the proposed new constitution claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally and contributed when the continental army protected their states interests the antifederalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the union and contributed to advance its needs dougherty 2009 concludes that generally the states behavior validated the federalist analysis this helps explain why the articles of confederation needed reforms foreign policy the 1783 treaty of paris which ended hostilities with great britain languished in congress for several months because too few delegates were present at any one time to constitute a quorum so that it could be ratified afterward the problem only got worse as congress had no power to enforce attendance rarely did more than half of the roughly sixty delegates attend a session of congress at the time causing difficulties in raising a quorum the resulting paralysis embarrassed and frustrated many american nationalists including george washington many of the most prominent national leaders such as washington john adams john hancock and benjamin franklin retired from public life served as foreign delegates or held office in state governments and for the general public local government and selfrule seemed quite satisfactory this served to exacerbate congresss impotence inherent weaknesses in the confederations frame of government also frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy in 1786 thomas jefferson concerned over the failure of congress to fund an american naval force to confront the barbary pirates wrote in a diplomatic correspondence to james monroe that it will be said there is no money in the treasury there never will be money in the treasury till the confederacy shows its teeth furthermore the 1786 jaygardoqui treaty with spain also showed weakness in foreign policy in this treaty which was never ratified the united states was to give up rights to use the mississippi river for 25 years which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the appalachian mountains finally due to the confederations military weakness it could not compel the british army to leave frontier forts which were on american soil  forts which in 1783 the british promised to leave but which they delayed leaving pending us implementation of other provisions such as ending action against loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation this incomplete british implementation of the treaty of paris would later be resolved by the implementation of jays treaty in 1795 after the federal constitution came into force taxation and commerce under the articles of confederation the central governments power was kept quite limited the confederation congress could make decisions but lacked enforcement powers implementation of most decisions including modifications to the articles required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures congress was denied any powers of taxation it could only request money from the states the states often failed to meet these requests in full leaving both congress and the continental army chronically short of money as more money was printed by congress the continental dollars depreciated in 1779 george washington wrote to john jay who was serving as the president of the continental congress that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions mr jay and the congress responded in may by requesting 45 million from the states in an appeal to the states to comply jay wrote that the taxes were the price of liberty the peace and the safety of yourselves and posterity he argued that americans should avoid having it said that america had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent or that her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith the states did not respond with any of the money requested from them congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or interstate commercemarch 2022 and as a result all of the states maintained control over their own trade policies the states and the confederation congress both incurred large debts during the revolutionary war and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the war some states paid off their war debts and others did not federal assumption of the states war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the constitutional convention accomplishments nevertheless the confederation congress did take two actions with longlasting impact the land ordinance of 1785 and northwest ordinance created territorial government set up protocols for the admission of new states and the division of land into useful units and set aside land in each township for public use this system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization as in europe and it established the precedent by which the national later federal government would be sovereign and expand westwardas opposed to the existing states doing so under their sovereignty the land ordinance of 1785 established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the mississippi river frontier lands were surveyed into the nowfamiliar squares of land called the township 36 square miles the section one square mile and the quarter section 160 acres this system was carried forward to most of the states west of the mississippi excluding areas of texas and california that had already been surveyed and divided up by the spanish empire then when the homestead act was enacted in 1867 the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settlerfarmers the northwest ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims organized the northwest territory and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states although it did not happen under the articles the land north of the ohio river and west of the present western border of pennsylvania ceded by massachusetts connecticut new york pennsylvania and virginia eventually became the states of ohio indiana illinois michigan and wisconsin and the part of minnesota that is east of the mississippi river the northwest ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery new states admitted to the union in this territory would never be slave states no new states were admitted to the union under the articles of confederation the articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the province of quebec referred to as canada in the articles into the united states if it chose to do so it did not and the subsequent constitution carried no such special provision of admission additionally ordinances to admit frankland later modified to franklin kentucky and vermont to the union were considered but none were approved presidents of congress under the articles of confederation the presiding officer of congressreferred to in many official records as president of the united states in congress assembledchaired the committee of the states when congress was in recess and performed other administrative functions he was not however an executive in the way the later president of the united states is a chief executive since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of congress there were 10 presidents of congress under the articles the first samuel huntington had been serving as president of the continental congress since september 28 1779 us under the articles the peace treaty left the united states independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure the articles envisioned a permanent confederation but granted to the congressthe only federal institutionlittle power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced there was no president no executive agencies no judiciary and no tax base the absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states which seldom arrived although historians generally agree that the articles were too weak to hold the fastgrowing nation together they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control by 1783 with the end of the british blockade the new nation was regaining its prosperity however trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the british and french empires the ports of the british west indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in british ships france and spain established similar policies simultaneously new manufacturers faced sharp competition from british products which were suddenly available again political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the revolution the apparent inability of the congress to redeem the public obligations debts incurred during the war or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development only aggravated a gloomy situation in 178687 shays rebellion an uprising of dissidents in western massachusetts against the state court system threatened the stability of state government the continental congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency spawning the expression not worth a continental congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the states less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784 although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone when john adams went to london in 1785 as the first representative of the united states he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty adams stated it was necessary for the states to confer the power of passing navigation laws to congress or that the states themselves pass retaliatory acts against great britain congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws meanwhile each state acted individually against great britain to little effect when other new england states closed their ports to british shipping connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports by 1787 congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping state legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population the idea of a convention to revise the articles of confederation grew in favor alexander hamilton realized while serving as washingtons top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual congress hamilton led a group of likeminded nationalists won washingtons endorsement and convened the annapolis convention in 1786 to petition congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in philadelphia to remedy the longterm crisis signatures the second continental congress approved the articles for distribution to the states on november 15 1777 a copy was made for each state and one was kept by the congress on november 28 the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned and the cover letter dated november 17 had only the signatures of henry laurens and charles thomson who were the president and secretary to the congress the articles however were unsigned and the date was blank congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the articles on june 27 1778 they ordered a final copy prepared the one in the national archives and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification on july 9 1778 the prepared copy was ready they dated it and began to sign they also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed on that date delegates present from new hampshire massachusetts rhode island connecticut new york pennsylvania virginia and south carolina signed the articles to indicate that their states had ratified new jersey delaware and maryland could not since their states had not ratified north carolina and georgia also were unable to sign that day since their delegations were absent after the first signing some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended for example john wentworth of new hampshire added his name on august 8 john penn was the first of north carolinas delegates to arrive on july 10 and the delegation signed the articles on july 21 1778 the other states had to wait until they ratified the articles and notified their congressional delegation georgia signed on july 24 new jersey on november 26 and delaware on february 12 1779 maryland refused to ratify the articles until every state had ceded its western land claims chevalier de la luzerne french minister to the united states felt that the articles would help strengthen the american government in 1780 when maryland requested france provide naval forces in the chesapeake bay for protection from the british who were conducting raids in the lower part of the bay he indicated that french admiral destouches would do what he could but la luzerne also sharply pressed maryland to ratify the articles thus suggesting the two issues were related on february 2 1781 the muchawaited decision was taken by the maryland general assembly in annapolis as the last piece of business during the afternoon session among engrossed bills was signed and sealed by governor thomas sim lee in the senate chamber in the presence of the members of both houses an act to empower the delegates of this state in congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation and perpetual union among the states the senate then adjourned to the first monday in august next the decision of maryland to ratify the articles was reported to the continental congress on february 12 the confirmation signing of the articles by the two maryland delegates took place in philadelphia at noon time on march 1 1781 and was celebrated in the afternoon with these events the articles were entered into force and the united states of america came into being as a sovereign federal state congress had debated the articles for over a year and a half and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates and some of the signers had only recently arrived the articles of confederation and perpetual union were signed by a group of men who were never present in the congress at the same time signers the signers and the states they represented were roger sherman connecticut was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the united states the continental association the united states declaration of independence the articles of confederation and the united states constitution robert morris pennsylvania signed three of the great state papers of the united states the united states declaration of independence the articles of confederation and the united states constitution john dickinson delaware daniel carroll maryland and gouverneur morris new york along with sherman and robert morris were the only five people to sign both the articles of confederation and the united states constitution gouverneur morris represented pennsylvania when signing the constitution parchment pages original parchment pages of the articles of confederation national archives and records administration revision and replacement in september 1786 delegates from five states met at what became known as the annapolis convention to discuss the need for reversing the protectionist interstate trade barriers that each state had erected at its conclusion delegates voted to invite all states to a larger convention to be held in philadelphia in 1787 the confederation congress later endorsed this convention for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of confederation although the states representatives to the constitutional convention in philadelphia were only authorized to amend the articles delegates held secret closeddoor sessions and wrote a new constitution the new frame of government gave much more power to the central government but characterization of the result is disputed the general goal of the authors was to get close to a republic as defined by the philosophers of the age of enlightenment while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships historian forrest mcdonald using the ideas of james madison from federalist 39 described the change this way in may 1786 charles pinckney of south carolina proposed that congress revise the articles of confederation recommended changes included granting congress power over foreign and domestic commerce and providing means for congress to collect money from state treasuries unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations however and congress failed to reach a consensus the weakness of the articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states especially after shays rebellion threatened to topple the state government of massachusetts historian ralph ketcham commented on the opinions of patrick henry george mason and other antifederalists who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787 jillson and wilson 1994 point to the financial weakness as well as the norms rules and institutional structures of the congress and the propensity to divide along sectional lines rakove identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the confederation the lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power it could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by rhode island rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes mustering men and gathering supplies from a warweary populace the second group of factors rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the continental congress confronted after 1783 especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy finally the confederations lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power when the war ended in 1783 certain special interests had incentives to create a new merchant state much like the british state people had rebelled against in particular holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims also manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods but competition among states made this impossible without a central government legitimacy of closing down two prominent political leaders in the confederation john jay of new york and thomas burke of north carolina believed that the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states to which the states gave their voluntary consent and until those obligations were fulfilled neither nullification of the authority of congress exercising its due powers nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges according to article xiii of the confederation any alteration had to be approved unanimously on the other hand article vii of the proposed constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states without unanimity the apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time and remains a topic of scholarly discussion in 1788 james madison remarked in federalist no 40 that the issue had become moot as this objection has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention i dismiss it without further observation nevertheless it is a historical and legal question whether opponents of the constitution could have plausibly attacked the constitution on that ground at the time there were state legislators who argued that the constitution was not an alteration of the articles of confederation but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply moreover the confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding modern scholars such as francisco forrest martin agree that the articles of confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it and thus other statesparties did not have to comply with the articles unanimous consent rule in contrast law professor akhil amar suggests that there may not have really been any conflict between the articles of confederation and the constitution on this point article vi of the confederation specifically allowed side deals among states and the constitution could be viewed as a side deal until all states ratified it final months on july 3 1788 the congress received new hampshires allimportant ninth ratification of the proposed constitution thus according to its terms establishing it as the new framework of governance for the ratifying states the following day delegates considered a bill to admit kentucky into the union as a sovereign state the discussion ended with congress making the determination that in light of this development it would be unadvisable to admit kentucky into the union as it could do so under the articles of confederation only but not under the constitution by the end of july 1788 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new constitution congress continued to convene under the articles with a quorum until october on saturday september 13 1788 the confederation congress voted the resolve to implement the new constitution and on monday september 15 published an announcement that the new constitution had been ratified by the necessary nine states set the first wednesday in january 1789 for appointing electors set the first wednesday in february 1789 for the presidential electors to meet and vote for a new president and set the first wednesday of march 1789 as the day for commencing proceedings under the new constitution on that same september 13 it determined that new york would remain the national capital see also citations general and cited references

columbus in 1492 that proved to be the most consequential columbus expedition ushered in an age of exploration and colonization of the americas by european powers most notably portugal spain france and the united kingdom from the 16th to 19th centuries the atlantic ocean was the center of both an eponymous slave trade and the columbian exchange while occasionally hosting naval battles such naval battles as well as growing trade from regional american powers like the united states and brazil both increased in degree during the early 20th century and while no major military conflicts took place in the atlantic in the present day the ocean remains a core component of trade around the world the atlantic ocean occupies an elongated sshaped basin extending longitudinally between europe and

known as oceanus the gigantic river that encircled the world in contrast to the enclosed seas well known to the greeks the mediterranean and the black sea in contrast the term atlantic originally referred specifically to the atlas mountains in morocco and the sea off the strait of gibraltar and the west african coast the term aethiopian ocean derived from ancient ethiopia was applied to the southern atlantic as late as the mid19th century during the age of discovery the atlantic was also known to english cartographers as the great western ocean the pond is a term often used by british and american speakers in reference to the northern atlantic ocean as a form of meiosis or ironic understatement it is used mostly when referring to events or circumstances on this side of the pond or on the other side of the pond or across the pond rather than to discuss the ocean itself the term dates to 1640 first appearing in print in pamphlet released during the reign of charles i and reproduced in 1869 in nehemiah wallingtons historical notices of events occurring chiefly in the reign of charles i where great pond is used in reference to the atlantic ocean by francis windebank

office conduct research on the ocean midatlantic ridge the mar divides the atlantic longitudinally into two halves in each of which a series of basins are delimited by secondary transverse ridges the mar reaches above 2000 along most of its length but is interrupted by larger transform faults at two places the romanche trench near the equator and the gibbs fracture zone at 53n the mar is a barrier for bottom water but at these two transform faults deep water currents can pass from one side to the other the mar rises 2 above the surrounding ocean floor and its rift valley is the divergent boundary between the north american and eurasian plates in the north atlantic and the south american and african plates in the south atlantic the mar produces basaltic volcanoes in eyjafjallajökull

worlds the remainder of the ridge was discovered in the 1920s by the german meteor expedition using echosounding equipment the exploration of the mar in the 1950s led to the general acceptance of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics most of the mar runs under water but where it reaches the surfaces it has produced volcanic islands while nine of these have collectively been nominated a world

and farther into the abyssal plains as deepsea channels in 1922 a historic moment in cartography and oceanography occurred the uss stewart used a navy sonic depth finder to draw a continuous map

the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the labrador sea denmark strait and baltic seaapril 2023 the coriolis effect circulates north atlantic water in a clockwise direction whereas south atlantic water circulates counterclockwise the south tides in the atlantic ocean are semidiurnal that is two high tides occur every 24 lunar hours in latitudes above 40 north some eastwest oscillation known as the north atlantic oscillation occurs salinity on average the atlantic is the saltiest major ocean surface water salinity in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand 3337 by mass and varies with latitude and season evaporation precipitation river inflow and sea ice melting influence surface salinity values although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator because of heavy tropical rainfall in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter maximum salinity values occur at about 25 north and south in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation the high surface salinity in the atlantic on which the atlantic thermohaline circulation is dependent is maintained by two processes the agulhas leakagerings which brings salty indian ocean waters into the south atlantic and the atmospheric bridge which evaporates subtropical atlantic waters and exports it to the pacific water masses the atlantic ocean consists of four major upper water masses with distinct temperature and salinity the atlantic subarctic upper water in the northernmost north atlantic is the source for subarctic intermediate water and north atlantic intermediate water north atlantic central water can be divided into the eastern and western north atlantic central water since the western part is strongly affected by the gulf stream and therefore the upper layer is closer to underlying fresher subpolar intermediate water the eastern water is saltier because of its proximity to mediterranean water north atlantic central water flows into south atlantic central water at 15n there are five intermediate waters four lowsalinity waters formed at subpolar latitudes and one highsalinity formed through evaporation arctic intermediate water flows from the north to become the source for north atlantic deep water south of the greenlandscotland sill these two intermediate waters have different salinity in the western and eastern basins the wide range of salinities in the north atlantic is caused by the asymmetry of the northern subtropical gyre and the large number of contributions from a wide range of sources labrador sea norwegiangreenland sea mediterranean and south atlantic intermediate water the north atlantic deep water nadw is a complex of four water masses two that form by deep convection in the open oceansndclassical and upper labrador sea watersndand two that form from the inflow of dense water across the greenlandicelandscotland sillsnddenmark strait and icelandscotland overflow water along its path across earth the composition of the nadw is affected by other water masses especially antarctic bottom water and mediterranean overflow water the nadw is fed by a flow of warm shallow water into the northern north atlantic which is responsible for the anomalous warm climate in europe changes in the formation of nadw have been linked to global climate changes in the past since humanmade substances were introduced into the environment the path of the nadw can be traced throughout its course by measuring tritium and radiocarbon from nuclear weapon tests in the 1960s and

stream which flows northward from the grand banks and the subpolar front an extension of the north atlantic current a wide vaguely defined region separating the subtropical gyre from the subpolar gyre this system of currents transport warm water into the north atlantic without which temperatures in the north atlantic and europe would plunge dramatically north of the north atlantic gyre the cyclonic north atlantic subpolar gyre plays a key role in climate variability it is governed by ocean currents from marginal seas and regional topography rather than being steered by wind both in the deep ocean and at sea level the subpolar gyre forms an important part of the global thermohaline circulation its eastern portion includes eddying branches of the north atlantic current which transport warm saline waters from the subtropics to the northeastern atlantic there this water is cooled during winter and forms return currents that merge along the eastern continental slope of greenland where they form an intense 4050 sv current which flows around the continental margins of the labrador sea a third of this water becomes part of the deep portion of the north atlantic deep water nadw the nadw in its turn feeds the meridional overturning circulation moc the northward heat transport of which is threatened by anthropogenic climate change large variations in the subpolar gyre on a decadecentury scale associated with the north atlantic oscillation are especially pronounced in labrador sea water the upper layers of the moc the south atlantic is dominated by the anticyclonic southern subtropical gyre the south atlantic central water originates in this gyre while antarctic intermediate water originates in the upper layers of the circumpolar region near the drake passage and the falkland islands both these currents receive some contribution from the indian ocean on the african east coast the small cyclonic angola gyre lies embedded in the large subtropical gyre the southern subtropical gyre is partly masked by a windinduced ekman layer the residence time of the gyre is 4485 years north atlantic deep water flows southward below the thermocline of the subtropical gyre sargasso sea the sargasso sea in the western north atlantic can be defined as the area where two species of sargassum s fluitans and natans float an area 4000 wide and encircled by the gulf stream north atlantic drift and north equatorial current this population of seaweed probably originated from tertiary ancestors on the european shores of the former tethys ocean and has if so maintained itself by vegetative growth floating in the ocean for millions of years other species endemic to the sargasso sea include the sargassum fish a predator with algaelike appendages which hovers motionless among the sargassum fossils of similar fishes have been found in fossil bays of the former tethys ocean in what is now the carpathian region that were similar to the sargasso sea it is possible that the population in the sargasso sea migrated to the atlantic as the tethys closed at the end of the miocene around 17 ma the origin of the sargasso fauna and flora remained enigmatic for centuries the fossils found in the carpathians in the mid20th century often called the quasisargasso assemblage finally showed that this assemblage originated in the carpathian basin from where it migrated over sicily to the central atlantic where it evolved into modern species of the sargasso sea the location of the spawning ground for european eels remained unknown for decades in the early 19th century it was discovered that the southern sargasso sea is the spawning ground for both the european and american eel and that the former migrate more than 5000 and the latter 2000 ocean currents such as the gulf stream transport eel larvae from the sargasso sea to foraging areas in north america europe and northern africa recent but disputed research suggests that eels possibly use earths magnetic field to navigate through the ocean both as larvae and as adults climate climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds because of the oceans great capacity to store and release heat maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures the oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation climatic zones vary with latitude the warmest zones stretch across the atlantic north of the equator the coldest zones are in high latitudes with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice ocean currents influence the climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas the gulf stream and its northern extension towards europe the north atlantic drift is thought to have at least some influence on climate for example the gulf stream helps moderate winter temperatures along the coastline of southeastern north america keeping it warmer in winter along the coast than inland areas the gulf stream also keeps extreme temperatures from occurring on the florida peninsula in the higher latitudes the north atlantic drift warms the atmosphere over the oceans keeping the british isles and northwestern europe mild and cloudy and not severely cold in winter like other locations at the same high latitude the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern canada the grand banks of newfoundland area and africas northwestern coast in general winds transport moisture and air over land areas natural hazards every winter the icelandic low produces frequent storms icebergs are common from early february to the end of july across the shipping lanes near the grand banks of newfoundland the ice season is longer in the polar regions but there is little shipping in those areas hurricanes are a hazard in the western parts of the north atlantic during the summer and autumn due to a consistently strong wind shear and a weak intertropical convergence zone south atlantic tropical cyclones are rare geology and plate tectonics the atlantic ocean is underlain mostly by dense mafic oceanic crust made up of basalt and gabbro and overlain by fine clay silt and siliceous ooze on the abyssal plain the continental margins and continental shelf mark lower density but greater thickness felsic continental rock that is often much older than that of the seafloor the oldest oceanic crust in the atlantic is up to 145 million years and situated off the west coast of africa and east coast of north america or on either side of the south atlantic in many places the continental shelf and continental slope are covered in thick sedimentary layers for instance on the north american side of the ocean large carbonate deposits formed in warm shallow waters such as florida and the bahamas while coarse river outwash sands and silt are common in shallow shelf areas like the georges bank coarse sand boulders and rocks were transported into some areas such as off the coast of nova scotia or the gulf of maine during the pleistocene ice ages central atlantic the breakup of pangaea began in the central atlantic between north america and northwest africa where rift basins opened during the late triassic and early jurassic this period also saw the first stages of the uplift of the atlas mountains the exact timing is controversial with estimates ranging from 200 to 170 ma the opening of the atlantic ocean coincided with the initial breakup of the supercontinent pangaea both of which were initiated by the eruption of the central atlantic magmatic province camp one of the most extensive and voluminous large igneous provinces in earths history associated with the triassicjurassic extinction event one of earths major extinction events theoliitic dikes sills and lava flows from the camp eruption at 200 ma have been found in west africa eastern north america and northern south america the extent of the volcanism has been estimated to 45e6 of which 25e6 covered what is now northern and central brazil the formation of the central american isthmus closed the central american seaway at the end of the pliocene 28 ma ago the formation of the isthmus resulted in the migration and extinction of many landliving animals known as the great american interchange but the closure of the seaway resulted in a great american schism as it affected ocean currents salinity and temperatures in both the atlantic and pacific marine organisms on both sides of the isthmus became isolated and either diverged or went extinct north atlantic geologically the northern atlantic is the area delimited to the south by two conjugate margins newfoundland and iberia and to the north by the arctic eurasian basin the opening of the northern atlantic closely followed the margins of its predecessor the iapetus ocean and spread from the central atlantic in six stages iberianewfoundland porcupinenorth america eurasiagreenland eurasianorth america active and inactive spreading systems in this area are marked by the interaction with the iceland hotspot seafloor spreading led to the extension of the crust and formations of troughs and sedimentary basins the rockall trough opened between 105 and 84 million years ago although along the rift failed along with one leading into the bay of biscay spreading began opening the labrador sea around 61 million years ago continuing until 36 million years ago geologists distinguish two magmatic phases one from 62 to 58 million years ago predates the separation of greenland from northern europe while the second from 56 to 52 million years ago happened as the separation occurred iceland began to form 62 million years ago due to a particularly concentrated mantle plume large quantities of basalt erupted at this time period are found on baffin island greenland the faroe islands and scotland with ash falls in western europe acting as a stratigraphic marker the opening of the north atlantic caused significant uplift of continental crust along the coast for instance in spite of 7 km thick basalt gunnbjorn field in east greenland is the highest point on the island elevated enough that it exposes older mesozoic sedimentary rocks at its base similar to old lava fields above sedimentary rocks in the uplifted hebrides of western scotland the north atlantic ocean contains about 810 seamounts most of them situated along the midatlantic ridge the ospar database convention for the protection of the marine environment of the northeast atlantic mentions 104 seamounts 74 within the national exclusive economic zone of these seamounts 46 are located close to the iberian peninsula south atlantic west gondwana south america and africa broke up in the early cretaceous to form the south atlantic the apparent fit between the coastlines of the two continents was noted on the first maps that included the south atlantic and it was also the subject of the first computerassisted plate tectonic reconstructions in 1965 this magnificent fit however has since then proven problematic and later reconstructions have introduced various deformation zones along the shorelines to accommodate the northwardpropagating breakup intracontinental rifts and deformations have also been introduced to subdivide both continental plates into subplates geologically the south atlantic can be divided into four segments equatorial segment from 10n to the romanche fracture zone rfz central segment from rfz to florianopolis fracture zone ffz north of walvis ridge and rio grande rise southern segment from ffz to the agulhasfalkland fracture zone affz and falkland segment south of affz in the southern segment the early cretaceous 133130 ma intensive magmatism of the paranáetendeka large igneous province produced by the tristan hotspot resulted in an estimated volume of 15e6 it covered an area of 12e6 in brazil paraguay and uruguay and 08e5 in africa dyke swarms in brazil angola eastern paraguay and namibia however suggest the lip originally covered a much larger area and also indicate failed rifts in all these areas associated offshore basaltic flows reach as far south as the falkland islands and south africa traces of magmatism in both offshore and onshore basins in the central and southern segments have been dated to 14749 ma with two peaks between 143 and 121 ma and 9060 ma in the falkland segment rifting began with dextral movements between the patagonia and colorado subplates between the early jurassic 190 ma and the early cretaceous 1267 ma around 150 ma seafloor spreading propagated northward into the southern segment no later than 130 ma rifting had reached the walvis ridgerio grande rise in the central segment rifting started to break africa in two by opening the benue trough around 118 ma rifting in the central segment however coincided with the cretaceous normal superchron also known as the cretaceous quiet period a 40 ma period without magnetic reversals which makes it difficult to date seafloor spreading in this segment the equatorial segment is the last phase of the breakup but because it is located on the equator magnetic anomalies cannot be used for dating various estimates date the propagation of seafloor spreading in this segment and consequent opening of the equatorial atlantic gateway eag to the period 12096 ma this final stage nevertheless coincided with or resulted in the end of continental extension in africa about 50 ma the opening of the drake passage resulted from a change in the motions and separation rate of the south american and antarctic plates first small ocean basins opened and a shallow gateway appeared during the middle eocene 3430 ma a deeper seaway developed followed by an eoceneoligocene climatic deterioration and the growth of the antarctic ice sheet closure of the atlantic an embryonic subduction margin is potentially developing west of gibraltar the gibraltar arc in the western mediterranean is migrating westward into the central atlantic where it joins the converging african and eurasian plates together these three tectonic forces are slowly developing into a new subduction system in the eastern atlantic basin meanwhile the scotia arc and caribbean plate in the western atlantic basin are eastwardpropagating subduction systems that might together with the gibraltar system represent the beginning of the closure of the atlantic ocean and the final stage of the atlantic wilson cycle history human origin humans evolved in africa around 7 mya then developing stone tools around 26 mya to finally evolve as modern humans around 200 kya the earliest evidence for the complex behavior associated with this behavioral modernity has been found in the greater cape floristic region gcfr along the coast of south africa during the latest glacial stages the nowsubmerged plains of the agulhas bank were exposed above sea level extending the south african coastline farther south by hundreds of kilometers a small population of modern humanssndprobably fewer than a thousand reproducing individualssndsurvived glacial maxima by exploring the high diversity offered by these palaeoagulhas plains the gcfr is delimited to the north by the cape fold belt and the limited space south of it resulted in the development of social networks out of which complex stone age technologies emerged human history thus begins on the coasts of south africa where the atlantic benguela upwelling and indian ocean agulhas current meet to produce an intertidal zone on which shellfish fur seal fish and sea birds provided the necessary protein sources the african origin of this modern behaviour is evidenced by 70000 yearsold engravings from blombos cave south africa old world mitochondrial dna mtdna studies indicate that 8060000 years ago a major demographic expansion within africa derived from a single small population coincided with the emergence of behavioral complexity and the rapid mis 54 environmental changes this group of people not only expanded over the whole of africa but also started to disperse out of africa into asia europe and australasia around 65000 years ago and quickly replaced the archaic humans in these regions during the last glacial maximum lgm 20000 years ago humans had to abandon their initial settlements along the european north atlantic coast and retreat to the mediterranean following rapid climate changes at the end of the lgm this region was repopulated by magdalenian culture other huntergatherers followed in waves interrupted by largescale hazards such as the laacher see volcanic eruption the inundation of doggerland now the north sea and the formation of the baltic sea the european coasts of the north atlantic were permanently populated about 985 thousand years ago this human dispersal left abundant traces along the coasts of the atlantic ocean 50 kyaold deeply stratified shell middens found in ysterfontein on the western coast of south africa are associated with the middle stone age msa the msa population was small and dispersed and the rate of their reproduction and exploitation was less intense than those of later generations while their middens resemble 1211 kyaold late stone age lsa middens found on every inhabited continent the 5045 kyaold enkapune ya muto in kenya probably represents the oldest traces of the first modern humans to disperse out of africa the same development can be seen in europe in la riera cave 2313 kya in asturias spain only some 26600 molluscs were deposited over 10 kya in contrast 87 kyaold shell middens in portugal denmark and brazil generated thousands of tons of debris and artefacts the ertebølle middens in denmark for example accumulated 2000 of shell deposits representing some 50 million molluscs over only a thousand years this intensification in the exploitation of marine resources has been described as accompanied by new technologiessndsuch as boats harpoons and fishhookssndbecause many caves found in the mediterranean and on the european atlantic coast have increased quantities of marine shells in their upper levels and reduced quantities in their lower the earliest exploitation however took place on the now submerged shelves and most settlements now excavated were then located several kilometers from these shelves the reduced quantities of shells in the lower levels can represent the few shells that were exported inland new world during the lgm the laurentide ice sheet covered most of northern north america while beringia connected siberia to alaska in 1973 late american geoscientist paul s martin proposed a blitzkrieg colonization of the americas by which clovis hunters migrated into north america around 13000 years ago in a single wave through an icefree corridor in the ice sheet and spread southward explosively briefly attaining a density sufficiently large to overkill much of their prey others later proposed a threewave migration over the bering land bridge these hypotheses remained the longheld view regarding the settlement of the americas a view challenged by more recent archaeological discoveries the oldest archaeological sites in the americas have been found in south america sites in northeast siberia report virtually no human presence there during the lgm and most clovis artefacts have been found in eastern north america along the atlantic coast furthermore colonisation models based on mtdna ydna and atdna data respectively support neither the blitzkrieg nor the threewave hypotheses but they also deliver mutually ambiguous results contradictory data from archaeology and genetics will most likely deliver future hypotheses that will eventually confirm each other a proposed route across the pacific to south america could explain early south american finds and another hypothesis proposes a northern path through the canadian arctic and down the north american atlantic coast early settlements across the atlantic have been suggested by alternative theories ranging from purely hypothetical to mostly disputed including the solutrean hypothesis and some of the precolumbian transoceanic contact theories the norse settlement of the faroe islands and iceland began during the 9th and 10th centuries a settlement on greenland was established before 1000 ce but contact with it was lost in 1409 and it was finally abandoned during the early little ice age this setback was caused by a range of factors an unsustainable economy resulted in erosion and denudation while conflicts with the local inuit resulted in the failure to adapt their arctic technologies a colder climate resulted in starvation and the colony got economically marginalized as the great plague harvested its victims on iceland in the 15th century iceland was initially settled 865930 ce following a warm period when winter temperatures hovered around 2 which made farming favorable at high latitudes this did not last however and temperatures quickly dropped at 1080 ce summer temperatures had reached a maximum of 5

reached india under the portuguese flag by navigating south around the cape of good hope thus proving that the atlantic and indian oceans are connected in 1500 in his voyage to india following vasco da gama pedro alvares cabral reached brazil taken by the currents of the south atlantic gyre following these explorations spain and portugal quickly conquered and colonized large territories in the new world and forced the amerindian population into slavery in order to exploit the vast quantities of silver and gold they found spain and portugal monopolized this trade in order to keep other european nations out but conflicting interests nevertheless led to a series of spanishportuguese wars a peace treaty mediated by the pope divided the conquered territories into spanish and portuguese sectors while keeping other colonial powers away england france and the dutch republic enviously watched the spanish and portuguese wealth grow and allied themselves with pirates such as henry mainwaring and alexandre exquemelin they could explore the convoys leaving the americas because prevailing winds and currents made the transport of heavy metals slow and predictable in the colonies of the americas depredation smallpox and others diseases and slavery quickly reduced the indigenous population of the americas to the extent that the atlantic slave trade had to be introduced to replace themsnda trade that became the norm and an integral part of the colonization between the 15th century and 1888 when brazil became the last part of the americas to end the slave trade an estimated ten million africans were exported as slaves most of them destined for agricultural labour the slave trade was officially abolished in the british empire and the united states in 1808 and slavery itself was abolished in the british empire in 1838 and in the united states in 1865 after the civil war from columbus to the industrial revolution transatlantic trade including colonialism and slavery became crucial for western europe for european countries with direct access to the atlantic including britain france the netherlands portugal and spain 15001800 was a period of sustained growth during which these countries grew richer than those in eastern europe and asia colonialism evolved as part of the transatlantic trade but this trade also strengthened the position of merchant groups at the expense of monarchs growth was more rapid in nonabsolutist countries such as britain and the netherlands and more limited in absolutist monarchies such as portugal spain and france where profit mostly or exclusively benefited the monarchy and its allies transatlantic trade also resulted in increasing urbanization in european countries facing the atlantic urbanization grew from 8 in 1300 101 in 1500 to 245 in 1850 in other european countries from 10 in 1300 114 in 1500 to 17 in 1850 likewise gdp doubled in atlantic countries but rose by only 30 in the rest of europe by end of the 17th century the volume of the transatlantic trade had surpassed that of the mediterranean trade economy the atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes the atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves the atlantic harbors petroleum and gas fields fish marine mammals seals and whales sand and gravel aggregates placer deposits polymetallic nodules and precious stones gold deposits are a mile or two under water on the ocean floor however the deposits are also encased in rock that must be mined through currently there is no costeffective way to mine or extract gold from the ocean to make a profit various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills marine debris and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea fisheries the shelves of the atlantic hosts one of the worlds richest fishing resources the most productive areas include the grand banks of newfoundland the scotian shelf georges bank off cape cod the bahama banks the waters around iceland the irish sea the bay of fundy the dogger bank of the north sea and the falkland banks fisheries have however undergone significant changes since the 1950s and global catches can now be divided into three groups of which only two are observed in the atlantic fisheries in the easterncentral and southwest atlantic oscillate around a globally stable value the rest of the atlantic is in overall decline following historical peaks the third group continuously increasing trend since 1950 is only found in the indian ocean and western pacific un fao partitioned atlantic in major fishing areas northeast atlantic is schematically limited to the 4000 west longitude except around greenland south to the 3600 north latitude and to the 6830 east longitude with both the west and east longitude limits reaching to the north pole the atlantics subareas include barents sea norwegian sea spitzbergen and bear island skagerrak kattegat sound belt sea and baltic sea north sea iceland and faroes grounds rockall northwest coast of scotland and north ireland irish sea west of ireland porcupine bank and eastern and western english channel bay of biscay portuguese waters azores grounds and northeast atlantic south north of azores and east greenland there are also two defunct subareas in 1497 john cabot became the first western european since the vikings to explore mainland north america and one of his major discoveries was the abundant resources of atlantic cod off newfoundland referred to as newfoundland currency this discovery yielded some 200 million tons of fish over five centuries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries new fisheries started to exploit haddock mackerel and lobster from the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of european and asian distantwater fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and the number of exploited species it also expanded the exploited areas from nearshore to the open sea and to great depths to include deepwater species such as redfish greenland halibut witch flounder and grenadiers overfishing in the area was recognised as early as the 1960s but because this was occurring on international waters it took until the late 1970s before any attempts to regulate was made in the early 1990s this finally resulted in the collapse of the atlantic northwest cod fishery the population of a number of deepsea fishes also collapsed in the process including american plaice redfish and greenland halibut together with flounder and grenadier environmental issues endangered species endangered marine species include the manatee seals sea lions turtles and whales drift net fishing can kill dolphins albatrosses and other seabirds petrels auks hastening the fish stock decline and contributing to international disputes waste and pollution marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles the biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste the excess of oxygendepleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone marine debris which is also known as marine litter describes humancreated waste floating in a body of water oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter the north atlantic garbage patch is estimated to be hundreds of kilometers across in size other pollution concerns include agricultural and municipal waste municipal pollution comes from the eastern united states southern brazil and eastern argentina oil pollution in the caribbean sea gulf of mexico lake maracaibo mediterranean sea and north sea and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the baltic sea north sea and mediterranean sea a usaf c124 aircraft from dover air force base delaware was carrying three nuclear bombs over the atlantic ocean when it experienced a loss of power for their own safety the crew jettisoned two nuclear bombs which were never recovered climate change north atlantic hurricane activity has increased over past decades because of increased sea surface temperature sst at tropical latitudes changes that can be attributed to either the natural atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo or to anthropogenic climate change a 2005 report indicated that the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc slowed down by 30 between 1957 and 2004 if the amo were responsible for sst variability the amoc would have increased in strength which is apparently not the case furthermore it is clear from statistical analyses of annual tropical cyclones that these changes do not display multidecadal cyclicity therefore these changes in sst must be caused by human activities the ocean mixed layer plays an important role in heat storage over seasonal and decadal timescales whereas deeper layers are affected over millennia and have a heat capacity about 50 times that of the mixed layer this heat uptake provides a timelag for climate change but it also results in thermal expansion of the oceans which contributes to sea level rise 21stcentury global warming will probably result in an equilibrium sealevel rise five times greater than today whilst melting of glaciers including that of the greenland icesheet expected to have virtually no effect during the 21st century will likely

philosophers theorists on western civilization university of göttingen alumni writers from gdańsk arthur schopenhauer ˈ shoh ˈaʁtuːɐ ˈʃoːpnhaʊɐ 22 february 1788  21 september 1860 was a german philosopher he is known for his 1818 work the world as will and representation expanded in 1844 which characterizes the phenomenal world as the manifestation of a blind and irrational noumenal will building on the transcendental idealism of immanuel kant 17241804 schopenhauer developed an atheistic metaphysical and ethical system that rejected the contemporaneous ideas of german idealism schopenhauer was among the first thinkers in western philosophy to share and affirm significant tenets of indian philosophy such as asceticism denial of the self and the notion of the worldasappearance his work has been described as an exemplary manifestation of philosophical pessimism though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his lifetime he had a posthumous impact across various disciplines including philosophy literature and science his writing on aesthetics morality and psychology have influenced many thinkers and artists life early life arthur schopenhauer was born on 22 february 1788 in danzig then part of the polishlithuanian commonwealth presentday gdańsk poland on heiliggeistgasse present day św ducha 47 the son of johanna schopenhauer née trosiener 17661838 and heinrich floris schopenhauer 17471805 both descendants of wealthy german patrician families while they came from a protestant background neither of them was very religious both supported the french revolution were republicans cosmopolitans and anglophiles when danzig became part of prussia in 1793 heinrich moved to hamburga free city with a republican constitution his firm continued trading in danzig where most of their extended families remained adele arthurs only sibling was born on 12 july 1797 in 1797 arthur was sent to le havre to live with the family of his fathers business associate grégoire de blésimaire he seemed to enjoy his twoyear stay there learning to speak french and fostering a lifelong friendship with jean anthime grégoire de blésimaire as early as 1799 arthur started playing the flute in 1803 he accompanied his parents on a european tour of holland britain france switzerland austria and prussia viewed as primarily a pleasure tour heinrich used the opportunity to visit some of his business associates abroad heinrich offered arthur a choice he could stay at home and start preparations for university or he could travel with them and continue his merchant education arthur chose to travel with them he deeply regretted his choice later because the merchant training was very tedious he spent twelve weeks of the tour attending school in wimbledon where he was confused by strict and intellectual anglicans who hed described as shallow he continued to sharply criticize anglican religiosity later in life despite his general anglophilia he was also under pressure from his father who became very critical of his educational results in 1805 heinrich drowned in a canal near their home in hamburg although it was possible that his death was accidental his wife and son believed that it was suicide he was prone to anxiety and depression each becoming more pronounced later in his life heinrich had become so fussy even his wife started to doubt his mental health there was in the fathers life some dark and vague source of fear which later made him hurl himself to his death from the attic of his house in hamburg arthur showed similar moodiness during his youth and often acknowledged that he inherited it from his father there were other instances of serious mental health problems on his fathers side of the family despite his hardship schopenhauer liked his father and later referred to him in a positive light heinrich schopenhauer left the family with a significant inheritance that was split in three among johanna and the children arthur schopenhauer was entitled to control of his part when he reached the age of majority he invested it conservatively in government bonds and earned annual interest that was more than double the salary of a university professor after quitting his merchant apprenticeship with some encouragement from his mother he dedicated himself to studies at the ernestine gymnasium gotha in saxegothaaltenburg while there he also enjoyed social life among the local nobility spending large amounts of money which deeply concerned his frugal mother he left the gymnasium after writing a satirical poem about one of the schoolmasters although arthur claimed that he left voluntarily his mothers letter indicates that he may have been expelled arthur spent two years as a merchant in honor of his dead father during this time he had doubts about being able to start a new life as a scholar most of his prior education was as a practical merchant and he had trouble learning latin a prerequisite for an academic career his mother moved away with her daughter adele to weimarthen the centre of german literatureto enjoy social life among writers and artists arthur and his mother did not part on good terms in one letter she wrote you are unbearable and burdensome and very hard to live with all your good qualities are overshadowed by your conceit and made useless to the world simply because you cannot restrain your propensity to pick holes in other people his mother johanna was generally described as vivacious and sociable she died 24 years later some of arthurs negative opinions about women may be rooted in his troubled relationship with his mother arthur moved to hamburg to live with his friend jean anthime who was also studying to become a merchant education he moved to weimar but did not live with his mother who even tried to discourage him from coming by explaining that they would not get along very well their relationship deteriorated even further due to their temperamental differences he accused his mother of being financially irresponsible flirtatious and seeking to remarry which he considered an insult to his fathers memory his mother while professing her love to him criticized him sharply for being moody tactless and argumentative and urged him to improve his behavior so that he would not alienate people arthur concentrated on his studies which were now going very well and he also enjoyed the usual social life such as balls parties and theater by that time johannas famous salon was well established among local intellectuals and dignitaries the most celebrated of them being goethe arthur attended her parties usually when he knew that goethe would be therealthough the famous writer and statesman seemed not even to notice the young and unknown student it is possible that goethe kept a distance because johanna warned him about her sons depressive and combative nature or because goethe was then on bad terms with arthurs language instructor and roommate franz passow schopenhauer was also captivated by the beautiful karoline jagemann mistress of karl august grand duke of saxeweimareisenach and he wrote to her his only known love poem despite his later celebration of asceticism and negative views of sexuality schopenhauer occasionally had sexual affairsusually with women of lower social status such as servants actresses and sometimes even paid prostitutes in a letter to his friend anthime he claims that such affairs continued even in his mature age and admits that he had two outofwedlock daughters born in 1819 and 1836 both of whom died in infancy in their youthful correspondence arthur and anthime were somewhat boastful and competitive about their sexual exploitsbut schopenhauer seemed aware that women usually did not find him very charming or physically attractive and his desires often remained unfulfilled he left weimar to become a student at the university of göttingen in 1809 there are no written reasons about why schopenhauer chose that university instead of the then more famous university of jena but göttingen was known as more modern and scientifically oriented with less attention given to theology law or medicine were usual choices for young men of schopenhauers status who also needed career and income he chose medicine due to his scientific interests among his notable professors were bernhard friedrich thibaut arnold hermann ludwig heeren johann friedrich blumenbach friedrich stromeyer heinrich adolf schrader johann tobias mayer and konrad johann martin langenbeck he studied metaphysics psychology and logic under gottlob ernst schulze the author of aenesidemus who made a strong impression and advised him to concentrate on plato and immanuel kant he decided to switch from medicine to philosophy around 181011 and he left göttingen which did not have a strong philosophy program besides schulze the only other philosophy professor was friedrich bouterwek whom schopenhauer disliked he did not regret his medicinal and scientific studies he claimed that they were necessary for a philosopher and even in berlin he attended more lectures in sciences than in philosophy during his days at göttingen he spent considerable time studying but also continued his flute playing and social life his friends included friedrich gotthilf osann karl witte christian charles josias von bunsen and william backhouse astor sr he arrived at the newly founded university of berlin for the winter semester of 181112 at the same time his mother had just begun her literary career she published her first book in 1810 a biography of her friend karl ludwig fernow which was a critical success arthur attended lectures by the prominent postkantian philosopher johann gottlieb fichte but quickly found many points of disagreement with his wissenschaftslehre he also found fichtes lectures tedious and hard to understand he later mentioned fichte only in critical negative termsseeing his philosophy as a lowerquality version of kants and considering it useful only because fichtes poor arguments unintentionally highlighted some failings of kantianism he also attended the lectures of the famous protestant theologian friedrich schleiermacher whom he also quickly came to dislike his notes and comments on schleiermachers lectures show that schopenhauer was becoming very critical of religion and moving towards atheism he learned by selfdirected reading besides plato kant and fichte he also read the works of schelling fries jacobi bacon locke and much current scientific literature he attended philological courses by august böckh and friedrich august wolf and continued his naturalistic interests with courses by martin heinrich klaproth paul erman johann elert bode ernst gottfried fischer johann horkel friedrich christian rosenthal and hinrich lichtenstein lichtenstein was also a friend whom he met at one of his mothers parties in weimar early work schopenhauer left berlin in a rush in 1813 fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as prussia had just joined the war against france he returned to weimar but left after less than a month disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover georg friedrich konrad ludwig müller von gerstenbergk 17781838 a civil servant twelve years younger than her he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his fathers memory he settled for a while in rudolstadt hoping that no army would pass through the small town he spent his time in solitude hiking in the mountains and the thuringian forest and writing his dissertation on the fourfold root of the principle of sufficient reason he completed his dissertation at about the same time as the french army was defeated at the battle of leipzig he became irritated by the arrival of soldiers in the town and accepted his mothers invitation to visit her in weimar she tried to convince him that her relationship with gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intention of remarrying but schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented pretentious and nationalistic his mother had just published her second book reminiscences of a journey in the years 1803 1804 and 1805 a description of their family tour of europe which quickly became a hit she found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy in a fit of temper arthur told her that people would read his work long after the rubbish she wrote was totally forgotten in fact although they considered her novels of dubious quality the brockhaus publishing firm held her in high esteem because they consistently sold well hans brockhaus 18881965 later claimed that his predecessors saw nothing in this manuscript but wanted to please one of our bestselling authors by publishing her sons work we published more and more of her son arthurs work and today nobody remembers johanna but her sons works are in steady demand and contribute to brockhaus reputation he kept large portraits of the pair in his office in leipzig for the edification of his new editors also contrary to his mothers prediction schopenhauers dissertation made an impression on goethe to whom he sent it as a gift although it is doubtful that goethe agreed with schopenhauers philosophical positions he was impressed by his intellect and extensive scientific education their subsequent meetings and correspondence were a great honor to a young philosopher who was finally acknowledged by his intellectual hero they mostly discussed goethes newly published and somewhat lukewarmly received work on color theory schopenhauer soon started writing his own treatise on the subject on vision and colors which in many points differed from his teachers although they remained polite towards each other their growing theoretical disagreementsand especially schopenhauers extreme selfconfidence and tactless criticismssoon made goethe become distant again and after 1816 their correspondence became less frequent schopenhauer later admitted that he was greatly hurt by this rejection but he continued to praise goethe and considered his color theory a great introduction to his own another important experience during his stay in weimar was his acquaintance with friedrich majera historian of religion orientalist and disciple of herderwho introduced him to eastern philosophy see also indology schopenhauer was immediately impressed by the upanishads he called them the production of the highest human wisdom and believed that they contained superhuman concepts and the buddha and put them on a par with plato and kant he continued his studies by reading the bhagavad gita an amateurish german journal asiatisches magazin and asiatick researches by the asiatic society schopenhauer held a profound respect for indian philosophy although he loved hindu texts he never revered a buddhist text but regarded buddhism as the most distinguished religion his studies on hindu and buddhist texts were constrained by the lack of adequate literature and the latter were mostly restricted to theravada buddhism he also claimed that he formulated most of his ideas independently and only later realized the similarities with buddhism schopenhauer read the latin translation and praised the upanishads in his main work the world as will and representation 1819 as well as in his parerga and paralipomena 1851 and commented as the relationship with his mother fell to a new low in may 1814 he left weimar and moved to dresden he continued his philosophical studies enjoyed the cultural life socialized with intellectuals and engaged in sexual affairs his friends in dresden were johann gottlob von quandt friedrich laun karl christian friedrich krause and ludwig sigismund ruhl a young painter who made a romanticized portrait of him in which he improved some of schopenhauers unattractive physical features his criticisms of local artists occasionally caused public quarrels when he ran into them in public schopenhauers main occupation during his stay in dresden was his seminal philosophical work the world as will and representation which he started writing in 1814 and finished in 1818 he was recommended to the publisher friedrich arnold brockhaus by baron ferdinand von biedenfeld an acquaintance of his mother although brockhaus accepted his manuscript schopenhauer made a poor impression because of his quarrelsome and fussy attitude as well as very poor sales of the book after it was published in december 1818 in september 1818 while waiting for his book to be published and conveniently escaping an affair with a maid that caused an unwanted pregnancy schopenhauer left dresden for a yearlong vacation in italy he visited venice bologna florence naples and milan travelling alone or accompanied by mostly english tourists he met he spent the winter months in rome where he accidentally met his acquaintance karl witte and engaged in numerous quarrels with german tourists in the caffè greco among them johann friedrich böhmer who also mentioned his insulting remarks and unpleasant character he enjoyed art architecture and ancient ruins attended plays and operas and continued his philosophical contemplation and love affairs one of his affairs supposedly became serious and for a while he contemplated marriage to a rich italian noblewomanbut despite his mentioning this several times no details are known and it may have been schopenhauer exaggerating he corresponded regularly with his sister adele and became close to her as her relationship with johanna and gerstenbergk also deteriorated she informed him about their financial troubles as the banking house of a l muhl in danzigin which her mother invested their whole savings and arthur a third of hiswas near bankruptcy arthur offered to share his assets but his mother refused and became further enraged by his insulting comments the women managed to receive only thirty percent of their savings while arthur using his business knowledge took a suspicious and aggressive stance towards the banker and eventually received his part in full the affair additionally worsened the relationships among all three members of the schopenhauer family he shortened his stay in italy because of the trouble with muhl and returned to dresden disturbed by the financial risk and the lack of responses to his book he decided to take an academic position since it provided him with both income and an opportunity to promote his views he contacted his friends at universities in heidelberg göttingen and berlin and found berlin most attractive he scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher g w f hegel whom schopenhauer described as a clumsy charlatan he was especially appalled by hegels supposedly poor knowledge of natural sciences and tried to engage him in a quarrel about it already at his test lecture in march 1820 hegel was also facing political suspicions at the time when many progressive professors were fired while schopenhauer carefully mentioned in his application that he had no interest in politics despite their differences and the arrogant request to schedule lectures at the same time as his own hegel still voted to accept schopenhauer to the university only five students turned up to schopenhauers lectures and he dropped out of academia a late essay on university philosophy expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies later life after his trying in academia he continued to travel extensively visiting leipzig nuremberg stuttgart schaffhausen vevey milan and spending eight months in florence before he left for his threeyear travel schopenhauer had an incident with his berlin neighbor 47yearold seamstress caroline louise marquet the details of the august 1821 incident are unknown he claimed that he had just pushed her from his entrance after she had rudely refused to leave and that she had purposely fallen to the ground so that she could sue him she claimed that he had attacked her so violently that she had become paralyzed on her right side and unable to work she immediately sued him and the process lasted until may 1827 when a court found schopenhauer guilty and forced him to pay her an annual pension until her death in 1842 schopenhauer enjoyed italy where he studied art and socialized with italian and english nobles it was his last visit to the country he left for munich and stayed there for a year mostly recuperating from various health issues some of them possibly caused by venereal diseases the treatment his doctor used suggests syphilis he contacted publishers offering to translate hume into german and kant into english but his proposals were declined returning to berlin he began to study spanish so he could read some of his favorite authors in their original language he liked pedro calderón de la barca lope de vega miguel de cervantes and especially baltasar gracián he also made failed attempts to publish his translations of their works a few attempts to revive his lecturesagain scheduled at the same time as hegelsalso failed as did his inquiries about relocating to other universities during his berlin years schopenhauer occasionally mentioned his desire to marry and have a family for a while he was unsuccessfully courting 17yearold flora weiss who was 22 years younger than himself his unpublished writings from that time show that he was already very critical of monogamy but still not advocating polygynyinstead musing about a polyamorous relationship that he called tetragamy he had an onandoff relationship with a young dancer caroline richter she also used the surname medon after one of her exlovers they met when he was 33 and she was 19 and working at the berlin opera she had already had numerous lovers and a son out of wedlock and later gave birth to another son this time to an unnamed foreign diplomat she soon had another pregnancy but the child was stillborn as schopenhauer was preparing to escape from berlin in 1831 due to a cholera epidemic he offered to take her with him on the condition that she left her young son behind she refused and he went alone in his will he left her a significant sum of money but insisted that it should not be spent in any way on her second son schopenhauer claimed that in his last year in berlin he had a prophetic dream that urged him to escape from the city as he arrived in his new home in frankfurt he supposedly had another supernatural experience an apparition of his dead father and his mother who was still alive this experience led him to spend some time investigating paranormal phenomena and magic he was quite critical of the available studies and claimed that they were mostly ignorant or fraudulent but he did believe that there are authentic cases of such phenomena and tried to explain them through his metaphysics as manifestations of the will upon his arrival in frankfurt he experienced a period of depression and declining health he renewed his correspondence with his mother and she seemed concerned that he might commit suicide like his father by now johanna and adele were living very modestly johannas writing did not bring her much income and her popularity was waning their correspondence remained reserved and arthur seemed undisturbed by her death in 1838 his relationship with his sister grew closer and he corresponded with her until she died in 1849 in july 1832 schopenhauer left frankfurt for mannheim but returned in july 1833 to remain there for the rest of his life except for a few short journeys he lived alone except for a succession of pet poodles named atman and butz in 1836 he published on the will in nature in 1836 he sent his essay on the freedom of the will to the contest of the royal norwegian society of sciences and won the prize for the following year he sent another essay on the basis of morality to the royal danish society for scientific studies but did not win the prize despite being the only contestant the society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a very offensive manner and claimed that the essay missed the point of the set topic and that the arguments were inadequate schopenhauer who had been very confident that he would win was enraged by this rejection he published both essays as the two basic problems of ethics the first edition published in 1841 again failed to draw attention to his philosophy in the preface to the second edition in 1860 he was still pouring insults on the royal danish society two years later after some negotiations he managed to convince his publisher brockhaus to print the second updated edition of the world as will and representation that book was again mostly ignored and the few reviews were mixed or negative schopenhauer began to attract some followers mostly outside academia among practical professionals several of them were lawyers who pursued private philosophical studies he jokingly referred to them as evangelists and apostles one of the most active early followers was julius frauenstädt who wrote numerous articles promoting schopenhauers philosophy he was also instrumental in finding another publisher after brockhaus declined to publish parerga and paralipomena believing that it would be another failure though schopenhauer later stopped corresponding with him claiming that he did not adhere closely enough to his ideas frauenstädt continued to promote schopenhauers work they renewed their communication in 1859 and schopenhauer named him heir for his literary estate frauenstädt also became the editor of the first collected works of schopenhauer in 1848 schopenhauer witnessed violent upheaval in frankfurt after general hans adolf erdmann von auerswald and prince felix lichnowsky were murdered he became worried for his own safety and property even earlier in life he had had such worries and kept a sword and loaded pistols near his bed to defend himself from thieves he gave a friendly welcome to austrian soldiers who wanted to shoot revolutionaries from his window and as they were leaving he gave one of the officers his opera glasses to help him monitor rebels the rebellion passed without any loss to schopenhauer and he later praised alfred i prince of windischgrätz for restoring order he even modified his will leaving a large part of his property to a prussian fund that helped soldiers who became invalids while fighting rebellion in 1848 or the families of soldiers who died in battle as young hegelians were advocating change and progress schopenhauer claimed that misery is natural for humans and that even if some utopian society were established people would still fight each other out of boredom or would starve due to overpopulation in 1851 schopenhauer published parerga and paralipomena which contains essays that are supplementary to his main work it was his first successful widely read book partly due to the work of his disciples who wrote praising reviews the essays that proved most popular were the ones that actually did not contain the basic philosophical ideas of his system many academic philosophers considered him a great stylist and cultural critic but did not take his philosophy seriously his early critics liked to point out similarities of his ideas to those of fichte and schelling or to claim that there were numerous contradictions in his philosophy both criticisms enraged schopenhauer he was becoming less interested in intellectual fights but encouraged his disciples to do so his private notes and correspondence show that he acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding contradictions inconsistencies and vagueness in his philosophy but claimed that he was not concerned about harmony and agreement in his propositions and that some of his ideas should not be taken literally but instead as metaphors academic philosophers were also starting to notice his work in 1856 the university of leipzig sponsored an essay contest about schopenhauers philosophy which was won by rudolf seydels very critical essay schopenhauers friend jules lunteschütz made the first of his four portraits of himwhich schopenhauer did not particularly likewhich was soon sold to a wealthy landowner carl ferdinand wiesike who built a house to display it schopenhauer seemed flattered and amused by this and would claim that it was his first chapel as his fame increased copies of paintings and photographs of him were being sold and admirers were visiting the places where he had lived and written his works people visited frankfurts englischer hof to observe him dining admirers gave him gifts and asked for autographs he complained that he still felt isolated due to his not very social nature and the fact that many of his good friends had already died from old age he remained healthy in his own old age which he attributed to regular walks no matter the weather and always getting enough sleep he had a great appetite and could read without glasses but his hearing had been declining since his youth and he developed problems with rheumatism he remained active and lucid continued his reading writing and correspondence until his death the numerous notes that he made during these years amongst others on aging were published posthumously under the title senilia in the spring of 1860 his health began to decline and he experienced shortness of breath and heart palpitations in september he suffered inflammation of the lungs and although he was starting to recover he remained very weak the last friend to visit him was wilhelm gwinner according to him schopenhauer was concerned that he would not be able to finish his planned additions to parerga and paralipomena but was at peace with dying he died of pulmonaryrespiratory failure on 21 september 1860 while sitting at home on his couch he died at the age of 72 and had a funeral conducted by a lutheran minister philosophy theory of perception in november 1813 goethe invited schopenhauer to help him on his theory of colours although schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter he accepted the invitation out of admiration for goethe nevertheless these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality kant openly admitted that it was humes skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations in critique of pure reason and gave an elaborate proof to show that causality is a priori after g e schulze had made it plausible that kant had not disproven humes skepticism it was up to those loyal to kants project to prove this important matter the difference between the approaches of kant and schopenhauer was this kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is given to us from outside an expression with which schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction he on the other hand was occupied with the questions how do we get this empirical content of perception how is it possible to comprehend subjective sensations limited to my skin as the objective perception of things that lie outside of me causality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions as hume had maintained instead as kant had said objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality by this intellectual operation comprehending every effect in our sensory organs as having an external cause the external world arises with vision finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines we are seldom conscious of the process that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object that inverts the impressions on the retinas and that uses the change in the apparent position of an object relative to more distant objects provided by binocular vision to perceive depth and distance schopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation he set out his theory of perception for the first time in on vision and colors and in the subsequent editions of fourfold root an extensive exposition is given in  21 the world as representation schopenhauer saw his philosophy as an extension of kants and used the results of kantian epistemological investigation transcendental idealism as starting point for his own kant had argued that the empirical world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our mental representations schopenhauer did not deny that the external world existed empirically but followed kant in claiming that our knowledge and experience of the world is always indirect schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work the world is my representation die welt ist meine vorstellung everything that there is for cognition the entire world exists simply as an object in relation to a subjecta representation to a subject everything that belongs to the world is therefore subjectdependent in book one of the world as will and representation schopenhauer considers the world from this anglethat is insofar as it is representation kant had previously argued that we perceive reality as something spatial and temporal not because reality is inherently spatial and temporal but because that is how our minds operate in perceiving an object therefore understanding objects in space and time represents our contribution to an experience for schopenhauer kants greatest service lay in the differentiation between phenomena and the thinginitself noumena based on the proof that between everything and us there is always a perceiving mind in other words kants primary achievement is to demonstrate that instead of being a blank slate where reality merely reveals its character the mind with sensory support actively participates in constructing reality thus schopenhauer believed that kant had shown that the everyday world of experience and indeed the entire material world related to space and time is merely appearance or phenomena entirely distinct from the thinginitself the world as will in book two of the world as will and representation schopenhauer considers what the world is beyond the aspect of it that appears to usthat is the aspect of the world beyond representation the world considered initself or noumena its inner essence the very being initself of all things schopenhauer argues is will wille the empirical world that appears to us as representation has plurality and is ordered in a spatiotemporal framework the world as thing initself must exist outside the subjective forms of space and time although the world manifests itself to our experience as a multiplicity of objects the objectivation of the will each element of this multiplicity has the same blind essence striving towards existence and life human rationality is merely a secondary phenomenon that does not distinguish humanity from the rest of nature at the fundamental essential level the advanced cognitive abilities of human beings schopenhauer argues serve the ends of willingan illogical directionless ceaseless striving that condemns the human individual to a life of suffering unredeemed by any final purpose schopenhauers philosophy of the will as the essential reality behind the world as representation is often called metaphysical voluntarism for schopenhauer understanding the world as will leads to ethical concerns see the ethics section below for further detail which he explores in the fourth book of the world as will and representation and again in his two prize essays on ethics on the freedom of the will and on the basis of morality no individual human actions are free schopenhauer argues because they are events in the world of appearance and thus are subject to the principle of sufficient reason a persons actions are a necessary consequence of motives and the given character of the individual human necessity extends to the actions of human beings just as it does to every other appearance and thus we cannot speak of freedom of individual willing albert einstein quoted the schopenhauerian idea that a man can do as he will but not will as he will yet the will as thing initself is free as it exists beyond the realm of representation and thus is not constrained by any of the forms of necessity that are part of the principle of sufficient reason according to schopenhauer salvation from our miserable existence can come through the wills being tranquillized by the metaphysical insight that reveals individuality to be merely an illusion the saint or great soul intuitively recognizes the whole comprehends its essence and finds that it is constantly passing away caught up in vain strivings inner conflict and perpetual suffering the negation of the will in other words stems from the insight that the world initself free from the forms of space and time is one ascetic practices schopenhauer remarks are used to aid the wills selfabolition which brings about a blissful redemptive willless state of emptiness that is free from striving or suffering art and aesthetics for schopenhauer human willingdesiring craving etcis at the root of suffering a temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation here one moves away from ordinary cognizance of individual things to cognizance of eternal platonic ideasin other words cognizance that is free from the service of will in aesthetic contemplation one no longer perceives an object of perception as something from which one is separated rather it is as if the object alone existed without anyone perceiving it and one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception but the two have become one the entirety of consciousness entirely filled and occupied by a single perceptual image subject and object are no longer distinguishable and the idea comes to the fore from this aesthetic immersion one is no longer an individual who suffers as a result of servitude to ones individual will but rather becomes a pure willless painless timeless subject of cognition the pure willless subject of cognition is cognizant only of ideas not individual things this is a kind of cognition that is unconcerned with relations between objects according to the principle of sufficient reason time space cause and effect and instead involves complete absorption in the object art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation since it attempts to depict the essencepure ideas of the world music for schopenhauer is the purest form of art because it is the one that depicts the will itself without it appearing as subject to the principle of sufficient reason therefore as an individual object according to daniel albright schopenhauer thought that music was the only art that did not merely copy ideas but actually embodied the will itself he deemed music a timeless universal language comprehended everywhere that can imbue global enthusiasm if in possession of a significant melody mathematics schopenhauers realist views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of contemporaneous attempts to prove the parallel postulate in euclidean geometry writing shortly before the discovery of hyperbolic geometry demonstrated the logical independence of the axiomand long before the general theory of relativity revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical spaceschopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect concepts to prove what he held was directly evident from intuitive perception throughout his writings schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts instead of from intuitive perceptions although schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove euclids parallel postulate he did see a reason for examining another of euclids axioms this follows kants reasoning ethics schopenhauer asserts that the task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done but to investigate moral actions as such he states that philosophy is always theoretical its task to explain what is given according to kants transcendental idealism space and time are forms of our sensibility in which phenomena appear in multiplicity reality in itself is free from multiplicity not in the sense that an object is one but that it is outside the possibility of multiplicity two individuals though they appear distinct are inthemselves not distinct appearances are entirely subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason the egoistic individual who focuses his aims on his own interests has to deal with empirical laws as well as he can what is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own selfinterest if we take a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support their needs instead of his own pleasures then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes less distinction between himself and others than is usually made regarding how things appear to us the egoist asserts a gap between two individuals but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own in the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals though they appear as distinct from himself what motivates the altruist is compassion the suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent but he feels connectiveness to all beings compassion is thus the basis of morality eternal justice schopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the principium individuationis when we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of othersthe will as the only thing that exists has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure this is a fundamental characteristic of the will and cannot be circumvented unlike temporal or human justice which requires time to repay an evil deed and has its seat in the state as requiting and punishing eternal justice rules not the state but the world is not dependent upon human institutions is not subject to chance and deception is not uncertain wavering and erring but infallible fixed and sure eternal justice is not retributive because retribution requires time there are no delays or reprieves instead punishment is tied to the offence to the point where the two become one  tormenter and tormented are one the tormenter errs in that he believes he is not a partaker in the suffering the tormented in that he believes he is not a partaker in the guilt suffering is the moral outcome of our attachment to pleasure schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by the christian dogma of original sin and in eastern religions by the dogma of rebirth quietism he who sees through the principium individuationis and comprehends suffering in general as his own will see suffering everywhere and instead of fighting for the happiness of his individual manifestation will abhor life itself since he knows that it is inseparably connected with suffering for him a happy individual life in a world of suffering is like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king those who have experienced this intuitive knowledge cannot affirm life but exhibit asceticism and quietism meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives are not concerned about their individual welfare and accept without resistance the evil that others inflict on them they welcome poverty and neither seek nor flee death schopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live human life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction and instead of continuing their struggle ascetics break it it does not matter if these ascetics adhere to the dogmata of christianity or to dharmic religions since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge psychology philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the necessity of sex but schopenhauer addressed sex and related concepts forthrightly he named a force within man that he felt took invariable precedence over reason the will to live or will to life wille zum leben defined as an inherent drive within human beings and all creatures to stay alive a force that inveigles us into reproducing schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental but rather understood it as an immensely powerful force that lay unseen within mans psyche guaranteeing the quality of the human race it has often been argued that schopenhauers thoughts on sexuality foreshadowed the theory of evolution a claim met with satisfaction by darwin as he included a quotation from schopenhauer in his descent of man this has also been noted about freuds concepts of the libido and the unconscious mind and evolutionary psychology in general political and social thought politics schopenhauers politics were an echo of his system of ethics which he elucidated in detail in his die beiden grundprobleme der ethik the two essays on the freedom of the will and on the basis of morality in occasional political comments in his parerga and paralipomena and manuscript remains schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of limited government schopenhauer shared the view of thomas hobbes on the necessity of the state and state action to check the innate destructive tendencies of our species he also defended the independence of the legislative judicial and executive branches of power and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice in a practical and everyday sense not a cosmological one he declared that monarchy is natural to man in almost the same way as it is to bees and ants to cranes in flight to wandering elephants to wolves in a pack in search of prey and to other animals intellect in monarchies he writes always has much better chances against stupidity its implacable and everpresent foe than it has in republics but this is a great advantage on the other hand schopenhauer disparaged republicanism as being as unnatural to man as it is unfavorable to higher intellectual life and thus to the arts and sciences by his own admission schopenhauer did not give much thought to politics and several times he wrote proudly of how little attention he paid to political affairs of his day in a life that spanned several revolutions in french and german government and a few continentshaking wars he maintained his position of minding not the times but the eternities he wrote many disparaging remarks about germany and the germans a typical example is for a german it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth for he thinks slowly and they give him time to reflect punishment the state schopenhauer claimed punishes criminals to prevent future crimes it places beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone in the inescapable punishment accordingly the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of countermotives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined  he claimed that this doctrine was not original to him but had appeared in the writings of plato seneca hobbes pufendorf and anselm feuerbach races and religions schopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern white races due to their sensitivity and creativity except for the ancient egyptians and hindus whom he saw as equal schopenhauer was fervently opposed to slavery speaking of the treatment of slaves in the slaveholding states of the united states he condemned those devils in human form those bigoted churchgoing strict sabbathobserving scoundrels especially the anglican parsons among them for how they treat their innocent black brothers who through violence and injustice have fallen into their devils claws the slaveholding states of north america schopenhauer writes are a disgrace to the whole of humanity schopenhauer also maintained a marked metaphysical and political antijudaism he argued that christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of judaism exhibiting an indianinfluenced ethics reflecting the aryanvedic theme of spiritual selfconquest he saw this as opposed to the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly jewish spirit women in his 1851 essay on women schopenhauer expressed opposition to what he called teutonicochristian stupidity of reflexive unexamined reverence for the female abgeschmackten weiberveneration he wrote women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish frivolous and shortsighted he opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice and expressed his opposition to monogamy he claimed that woman is by nature meant to obey the essay does give some compliments women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than men are and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others schopenhauers writings influenced many from friedrich nietzsche to nineteenthcentury feminists his biological analysis of the difference between the sexes and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists when the elderly schopenhauer sat for a sculpture portrait by the prussian sculptor elisabet ney in 1859 he was much impressed by the young womans wit and independence as well as by her skill as a visual artist after his time with ney he told richard wagners friend malwida von meysenbug i have not yet spoken my last word about women i believe that if a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass or rather raising herself above the mass she grows ceaselessly and more than a man pederasty in the third expanded edition of the world as will and representation 1859 schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the metaphysics of sexual love he wrote that pederasty has the benefit of preventing illbegotten children concerning this he stated that the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims although only indirectly as a means for preventing greater evils schopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that by expounding these paradoxical ideas i wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour i have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that i defend and commend pederasty heredity and eugenics schopenhauer viewed personality and intellect as inherited he quotes horaces saying from the brave and good are the brave descended odes iv 4 29 and shakespeares line from cymbeline cowards father cowards and base things sire base iv 2 to reinforce his hereditarian argument mechanistically schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his intellect through his mother and personal character through the father this belief in heritability of traits informed schopenhauers view of loveplacing it at the highest level of importance for schopenhauer the final aim of all love intrigues be they comic or tragic is really of more importance than all other ends in human life what it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation  it is not the weal or woe of any one individual but that of the human race to come which is here at stake this view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on eugenics or good breeding here schopenhauer wrote in another context schopenhauer reiterated his eugenic thesis if you want utopian plans i would say the only solution to the problem is the despotism of the wise and noble members of a genuine aristocracy a genuine nobility achieved by mating the most magnanimous men with the cleverest and most gifted women this proposal constitutes my utopia and my platonic republic analysts eg keith ansellpearson have suggested that schopenhauers antiegalitarianist sentiment and his support for eugenics influenced the neoaristocratic philosophy of friedrich nietzsche who initially considered schopenhauer his mentor animal rights as a consequence of his monistic philosophy schopenhauer was very concerned about animal welfare and rights for him all individual animals including humans are essentially phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying will for him the word will designates force power impulse energy and desire it is the closest word we have that can signify both the essence of all external things and our own direct inner experience since every living thing possesses will humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other for this reason he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals who are our fellow sufferers in 1841 he praised the establishment in london of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and in philadelphia of the animals friends society schopenhauer went so far as to protest using the pronoun it in reference to animals because that led to treatment of them as though they were inanimate things to reinforce his points schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter schopenhauer was very attached to his succession of pet poodles he criticized spinozas belief that animals are a mere means for the satisfaction of humans tim madigan wrote that despite all of his bombast schopenhauer was a sympathetic character who had concerns for the suffering of animals intellectual interests and affinities indology schopenhauer read the latin translation of the ancient hindu texts the upanishads translated by french writer anquetil du perron from the persian translation of prince dara shukoh entitled sirreakbar the great secret he was so impressed by its philosophy that he called it the production of the highest human wisdom and believed it contained superhuman concepts schopenhauer considered india as the land of the most ancient and most pristine wisdom the place from which europeans could trace their descent and the tradition by which they had been influenced in so many decisive ways and regarded the upanishads as the most profitable and elevating reading which  is possible in the world it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death schopenhauer was first introduced to anquetil du perrons translation by friedrich majer in 1814 they met during the winter of 18131814 in weimar at the home of schopenhauers mother according to the biographer safranski majer was a follower of herder and an early indologist schopenhauer did not begin serious study of the indic texts until the summer of 1814 safranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817 schopenhauer had another important crosspollination with indian thought in dresden this was through his neighbor of two years karl christian friedrich krause krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with ancient indian wisdom krause had also mastered sanskrit unlike schopenhauer and they developed a professional relationship it was from krause that schopenhauer learned meditation and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning indian thought the book oupnekhat upanishad always lay open on his table and he invariably studied it before going to bed he called the opening up of sanskrit literature the greatest gift of our century and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the upanishads would become the cherished faith of the west most noticeable in the case of schopenhauers work was the significance of the chandogya upanishad whose mahāvākya tat tvam asi is mentioned throughout the world as will and representation buddhism schopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the four noble truths of buddhism similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering that suffering is caused by desire taṇhā and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation thus three of the four truths of the buddha correspond to schopenhauers doctrine of the will in buddhism while greed and lust are always unskillful desire is ethically variable  it can be skillful unskillful or neutral for schopenhauer will had ontological primacy over the intellect desire is prior to thought schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of puruṣārtha or goals of life in vedānta hinduism in schopenhauers philosophy denial of the will is attained by buddhist nirvāṇa is not equivalent to the condition that schopenhauer described as denial of the will nirvāṇa is not the extinguishing of the person as some western scholars have thought but only the extinguishing the literal meaning of nirvana of the flames of greed hatred and delusion that assail a persons character schopenhauer made the following statement in his discussion of religions buddhist philosopher keiji nishitani sought to distance buddhism from schopenhauer while schopenhauers philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary his methodology was resolutely empirical rather than speculative or transcendental also note the argument that buddhism affected schopenhauers philosophy more than any other dharmic faith loses credence since he did not begin a serious study of buddhism until after the publication of the world as will and representation in 1818 scholars have started to revise earlier views about schopenhauers discovery of buddhism proof of early interest and influence appears in schopenhauers 181516 notes transcribed and translated by urs app about buddhism they are included in a recent case study that traces schopenhauers interest in buddhism and documents its influence other scholarly work questions how similar schopenhauers philosophy actually is to buddhism magic and occultism some traditions in western esotericism and parapsychology interested schopenhauer and influenced his philosophical theories he praised animal magnetism as evidence for the reality of magic in his on the will in nature and went so far as to accept the division of magic into lefthand and righthand magic although he doubted the existence of demons schopenhauer grounded magic in the will and claimed all forms of magical transformation depended on the human will not on ritual this theory notably parallels aleister crowleys system of magic and its emphasis on human will given the importance of the will to schopenhauers overarching system this amounts to suggesting his whole philosophical system had magical powers schopenhauer rejected the theory of disenchantment and claimed philosophy should synthesize itself with magic which he believed amount to practical metaphysics neoplatonism including the traditions of plotinus and to a lesser extent marsilio ficino has also been cited as an influence on schopenhauer interests schopenhauer had a wide range of interests from science and opera to occultism and literature in his student years schopenhauer went more often to lectures in the sciences than philosophy he kept a strong interest as his personal library contained near to 200 books of scientific literature at his death and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library many evenings were spent in the theatre opera and ballet schopenhauer especially liked the operas of mozart rossini and bellini schopenhauer considered music the highest art and played the flute during his whole life as a polyglot he knew german italian spanish french english latin and ancient greek and was an avid reader of poetry and literature he particularly revered goethe petrarch calderón and shakespeare in philosophy his most important influences were according to himself kant plato and the upanishads concerning the upanishads and vedas he writes in the world as will and representation thoughts on other philosophers giordano bruno and spinoza schopenhauer saw bruno and spinoza as philosophers not bound to their age or nation both were fulfilled by the thought that as manifold the appearances of the world may be it is still one being that appears in all of them  consequently there is no place for god as creator of the world in their philosophy but god is the world itself schopenhauer expressed regret that spinoza stuck for the presentation of his philosophy with the concepts of scholasticism and cartesian philosophy and tried to use geometrical proofs that do not hold because of vague and overly broad definitions bruno on the other hand who knew much about nature and ancient literature presented his ideas with italian vividness and is amongst philosophers the only one who comes near platos poetic and dramatic power of exposition schopenhauer noted that their philosophies do not provide any ethics and it is therefore very remarkable that spinoza called his main work ethics in fact it could be considered complete from the standpoint of lifeaffirmation if one completely ignores morality and selfdenial it is yet even more remarkable that schopenhauer mentions spinoza as an example of the denial of the will if one uses the french biography by jean maximilien lucas as the key to tractatus de intellectus emendatione immanuel kant the importance of kant for schopenhauer in philosophy as well as on a personal level cannot be overstated kants philosophy was the foundation of schopenhauers and he had high praise for the transcendental aesthetic section of kants critique of pure reason schopenhauer maintained that kant stands in the same relation to philosophers such as berkeley and plato as copernicus to hicetas philolaus and aristarchus kant succeeded in demonstrating what previous philosophers merely asserted schopenhauer writes about kants influence on his work in the preface to the second edition of the world as will and representation in his study room one bust was of buddha the other was of kant the bond which schopenhauer felt with the philosopher of königsberg is demonstrated in an unfinished poem he dedicated to kant included in volume 2 of the parerga schopenhauer dedicated one fifth of his main work the world as will and representation to a detailed criticism of the kantian philosophy schopenhauer praised kant for his distinction between appearance and the thinginitself whereas the general consensus in german idealism was that this was the weakest spot of kants theory since according to kant causality can find application on objects of experience only and consequently thingsinthemselves cannot be the cause of appearances the inadmissibility of this reasoning was also acknowledged by schopenhauer he insisted that this was a true conclusion drawn from false premises postkantian school the leading figures of postkantian philosophyjohann gottlieb fichte f w j schelling and g w f hegelwere not respected by schopenhauer he argued that they were not philosophers at all for they lacked the first requirement of a philosopher namely a seriousness and honesty of inquiry rather they were merely sophists who excelling in the art of beguiling the public pursued their own selfish interests such as professional advancement within the university system diatribes against the alleged vacuity dishonesty pomposity and selfinterest of these contemporaries are to be found throughout schopenhauers published writings the following passage is an example schopenhauer deemed schelling the most talented of the three and wrote that he would recommend his elucidatory paraphrase of the highly important doctrine of kant concerning the intelligible character if he had been honest enough to admit he was parroting kant instead of hiding this relation in a cunning manner schopenhauer reserved his most unqualified damning condemnation for hegel whom he considered less worthy than fichte or schelling whereas fichte was merely a windbag windbeutel hegel was a commonplace inane loathsome repulsive and ignorant charlatan the philosophers karl popper and mario bunge agreed with this distinction hegel schopenhauer wrote in the preface to his two fundamental problems of ethics not only performed no service to philosophy but he has had a detrimental influence on philosophy and thereby on german literature in general really a downright stupefying or we could even say a pestilential influence which it is therefore the duty of everyone capable of thinking for himself and judging for himself to counteract in the most express terms at every opportunity influence and legacy schopenhauer remained the most influential german philosopher until the first world war his philosophy was a starting point for a new generation of philosophers including julius bahnsen paul deussen lazar von hellenbach karl robert eduard von hartmann ernst otto lindner philipp mainländer friedrich nietzsche olga plümacher and agnes taubert his legacy shaped the intellectual debate and forced movements that were utterly opposed to him neokantianism and positivism to address issues they would otherwise have completely ignored and in doing so he changed them markedly the french writer maupassant commented that today even those who execrate him seem to carry in their own souls particles of his thought other philosophers of the 19th century who cited his influence include hans vaihinger volkelt solovyov and weininger schopenhauer was well read by physicists most notably einstein schrödinger wolfgang pauli and majorana einstein described schopenhauers thoughts as a continual consolation and called him a genius in his berlin study three figures hung on the wall faraday maxwell schopenhauer konrad wachsmann recalled he often sat with one of the wellworn schopenhauer volumes and as he sat there he seemed so pleased as if he were engaged with a serene and cheerful work when erwin schrödinger discovered schopenhauer the greatest savant of the west he considered switching his study of physics to philosophy he maintained the idealistic views during the rest of his life wolfgang pauli accepted the main tenet of schopenhauers metaphysics that the thinginitself is will but most of all schopenhauer is famous for his influence on artists richard wagner became one of the earliest and most famous adherents of the schopenhauerian philosophy the admiration was not mutual and schopenhauer proclaimed i remain faithful to rossini and mozart so he has been nicknamed the artists philosopher see also influence of schopenhauer on tristan und isolde under the influence of schopenhauer leo tolstoy became convinced that the truth of all religions lies in selfrenunciation when he read schopenhauers philosophy tolstoy exclaimed at present i am convinced that schopenhauer is the greatest genius among men  it is the whole world in an incomparably beautiful and clear reflection he said that what he has written in war and peace is also said by schopenhauer in the world as will and representation jorge luis borges remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular was because schopenhauer had already written it for him other figures in literature who were strongly influenced by schopenhauer were thomas mann thomas hardy afanasy fet jk huysmans and george santayana in herman melvilles final years while he wrote billy budd he read schopenhauers essays and marked them heavily scholar brian yothers notes that melville marked numerous misanthropic and even suicidal remarks suggesting an attraction to the most extreme sorts of solitude but he also made note of schopenhauers reflection on the moral ambiguities of genius schopenhauers attraction to and discussions of both eastern and western religions in conjunction with each other made an impression on melville in his final years sergei prokofiev although initially reluctant to engage with works noted for their pessimism became fascinated with schopenhauer after reading aphorisms on the wisdom of life in parerga and paralipomena with his truths schopenhauer gave me a spiritual world and an awareness of happiness friedrich nietzsche owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading the world as will and representation and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected dedicating to him his essay schopenhauer als erzieher one of his untimely meditations early in his career ludwig wittgenstein adopted schopenhauers epistemological idealism and some traits of schopenhauers influence particularly schopenhauerian transcendentalism can be observed in the tractatus logicophilosophicus later on wittgenstein rejected epistemological transcendental idealism for gottlob freges conceptual realism in later years wittgenstein became highly dismissive of schopenhauer describing him as an ultimately shallow thinker his friend bertrand russell had a low opinion on the philosopher and even came to attack him in his history of western philosophy for hypocritically praising asceticism yet not acting upon it opposite to russell on the foundations of mathematics the dutch mathematician l e j brouwer incorporated kants and schopenhauers ideas in the philosophical school of intuitionism where mathematics is considered as a purely mental activity instead of an analytic activity wherein objective properties of reality are revealed brouwer was also influenced by schopenhauers metaphysics and wrote an essay on mysticism schopenhauers philosophy has made its way into a novel the schopenhauer cure by american existential psychiatrist and emeritus professor of psychiatry irvin yalom schopenhauers philosophy and the discussions on philosophical pessimism it has engendered has been the focus of contemporary thinkers such as david benatar thomas ligotti and eugene thacker their work also served as an inspiration for the popular hbo tv series true detective as well as life is beautiful in this regard schopenhauer is sometimes considered the founding father of todays antinatalism

province the province of cabinda that borders the republic of the congo and the democratic republic of the congo the capital and most populous city is luanda angola has been inhabited since the paleolithic age its formation as a nationstate originates from the kingdom of kongo the hegemonic state of a number of other kikongospeaking kingdoms that flourished in and after the 14th century the kingdom of kongo became extremely wealthy and powerful through establishing the atlantic slave trade with the portuguese empire which first established relations with kongo in 1483 and gradually began building coastal settlements and trading posts the banning of the slave trade in the 19th century severely disrupted kongos undiversified economic system allowing european settlers to gradually begin establishing themselves in the interior the portuguese colony that became angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century owing to resistance by native groups such as the cuamato the kwanyama and the mbunda after a protracted anticolonial struggle angola achieved independence in 1975 as a oneparty republic the country descended into a devastating civil war the same year between the ruling peoples movement for the liberation of angola mpla backed by the soviet union and cuba the insurgent national union for the total independence of angola an originally maoist and later anticommunist group supported by the united states and south africa and the militant organization national liberation front of angola backed by zaire the country has been governed by mpla ever since its independence in 1975 following the end of the war in 2002 angola emerged as a relatively stable constitutional republic angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves and its economy is among the fastestgrowing in the world especially since the end of the civil war however economic growth is highly uneven with most of the nations wealth concentrated in a disproportionately small part of the population the largest investment and trade partners are china the european union and the united states the standard of living remains low for most angolans life expectancy is among the lowest in the world while infant mortality is among the highest since 2017 the government of joão lourenço has made fighting corruption its flagship so much so that many individuals of the previous government are either jailed or awaiting trial whilst this effort has been recognised by foreign diplomats to be legitimate some skeptics see the actions as being politically motivated angola is a member of the united nations african union the community of portuguese language countries and the southern african development community 2023 the angolan population is estimated at 372 million angola is multicultural and multiethnic angolan culture reflects centuries of portuguese influence namely the predominance of the portuguese language and of the catholic church intermingled with a variety of indigenous customs and traditions etymology the name angola comes from the portuguese colonial name reino de angola kingdom of angola which appeared as early as paulo dias de novaiss 1571 charter the toponym was derived by the portuguese from the title ngola held by the kings of ndongo and matamba ndongo in the highlands between the kwanza and lucala rivers was nominally a possession of the kingdom of kongo but was seeking greater independence in the 16th century history early migrations and political units modern angola was populated predominantly by nomadic khoi and san prior to the first bantu migrations the khoi and san peoples were neither pastoralists nor cultivators but rather huntergatherers they were displaced by bantu peoples arriving from the north in the first millennium bc most of whom likely originated in what is today northwestern nigeria and southern niger bantu speakers introduced the cultivation of bananas and taro as well as large cattle herds to angolas central highlands and the luanda plain due to a number of inhibiting geographic factors throughout the landscape of angola namely harshly traversable land hothumid climate and a plethora of deadly diseases intermingling of precolonial tribes in angola was raredecember 2023 a number of political entities were established the bestknown of these was the kingdom of kongo based in angola which extended northward to what is now the democratic republic of the congo the republic of the congo and gabon it established trade routes with other citystates and civilisations up and down the coast of southwestern and western africa and even with great zimbabwe and the mutapa empire although it engaged in little or no transoceanic trade to its south lay the kingdom of ndongo from which the area of the later portuguese colony was sometimes known as dongo and right next to them lay the kingdom of matambathe lesser kingdom of kakongo to the north was later a vassal of the kingdom of kongo all of these states spoke kikongo as a common language portuguese colonization portuguese explorer diogo cão reached the area in 1484 the previous year the portuguese had established relations with the kingdom of kongo which stretched at the time from modern gabon in the north to the kwanza river in the south the portuguese established their primary early trading post at soyo which is now the northernmost city in angola apart from the cabinda exclave paulo dias de novais founded são paulo de loanda luanda in 1575 with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers benguela was fortified in 1587 and became a township in 1617 an authoritarian state the kingdom of kongo was highly centralised around its monarch and controlled neighbouring states as vassals it had a strong economy based on the industries of copper ivory salt hides and to a lesser extent slaves the transition from a feudal system of slavery to a capitalist one with portugal would prove crucial to the history of the kingdom of kongo as relations between kongo and portugal grew in the early 16th century trade between the kingdoms also increased most of the trade was in palm cloth copper and ivory but also increasing numbers of slaves kongo exported few slaves and its slave market remained internal however following the development of a successful sugargrowing colony on the portuguese settlement of sao tome kongo became a major source of slaves for the islands traders and plantations correspondence by afonso also show the purchase and sale of slaves within the country and his accounts on capturing slaves in war which were given and sold to portuguese merchants afonso continued to expand the kingdom of kongo into the 1540s expanding its borders to the south and east the expansion of kongos population coupled with his earlier religious reforms allowed afonso to centralize power in his capital and increase the power of the monarchy he also established a royal monopoly on some trade to govern the growing slave trade afonso and several portuguese kings claimed a joint monopoly on the external slave trade the slave trade increasingly became kongos primary and arguably sole economic sector a major obstacle for the kingdom of kongo was that slaves were the only commodity which the european powers were willing to trade for making kongo lack an effective international currency kongolese nobles could buy slaves with the national currency of nzimbu shells which in turn could be traded for slaves and then for international currency as the slave trade was the only factor in which europeans were interested in the region during the 16th and 17th centuries the economy became unable to diversify or later industrialise outside of sectors in which slavery was involved such as the arms industry the increased production and sale of guns within the kingdom was due to the salient issue of the slave trade which had become an increasingly violent struggle there was a constant need for slaves for the kings and queens to sell in exchange foreign commodities the absence of which would prevent them from having any influence with european powers such as portugal and eventually the dutch republic kongolese kings would desperately need this influence to garner support from european powers for quelling internal rebellions the situation became increasingly complicated during the rule of garcia ii who needed the assistance of the dutch military to drive out the portuguese from luanda inspite of the fact that portugal was kongos primary slave trading partner by the early 17th century the supply of foreign slaves captured by the kongolese externally was waning it eventually became common practice for freeborn kongolese citizens to succumb to slavery through disobeying the authoritarian system and the aristocracy in any way if several villagers were deemed guilty of a crime it became relatively common for the whole village to be inslaved the resulting chaos and internal conflict from garcia iis reign would lead into that of his son and sucessor antónio i who was later killed at the battle of mbwila in 1665 alongside a substantial proportion of the aristocracy by the increasingly expansionist portuguese war broke out more widely in the kingdom of kongo after the death of antónio i much of the stability and access to iron ore and charcoal necessary for gunsmiths to maintain the arms industry was disrupted from then on in this period almost every kongolese citizen was in danger of being enslaved this was especially because many kongolese subjects were adroit in making guns and their skills became invaluable in new world settings as blacksmiths ironworkers and charcoal makers the portuguese established several other settlements forts and trading posts along the angolan coast principally trading in angolan slaves for plantations local slave dealers provided a large number of slaves for the portuguese empire usually in exchange for manufactured goods from europe this part of the atlantic slave trade continued until after brazils independence in the 1820s despite portugals territorial claims in angola its control over much of the countrys vast interior was minimal in the 16th century portugal gained control of the coast through a series of treaties and wars life for european colonists was difficult and progress was slow john iliffe notes that portuguese records of angola from the 16th century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years accompanied by epidemic disease it might kill onethird or onehalf of the population destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys during the portuguese restoration war the dutch west india company occupied the principal settlement of luanda in 1641 using alliances with local peoples to carry out attacks against portuguese holdings elsewhere a fleet under salvador de sá retook luanda in 1648 reconquest of the rest of the territory was completed by 1650 new treaties with the kongo were signed in 1649 others with njingas kingdom of matamba and ndongo followed in 1656 the conquest of pungo andongo in 1671 was the last major portuguese expansion from luanda as attempts to invade kongo in 1670 and matamba in 1681 failed colonial outposts also expanded inward from benguela but until the late 19th century the inroads from luanda and benguela were very limited hamstrung by a series of political upheavals in the early 1800s portugal was slow to mount a large scale annexation of angolan territory the slave trade was abolished in angola in 1836 and in 1854 the colonial government freed all its existing slaves four years later a more progressive administration appointed by portugal abolished slavery altogether however these decrees remained largely unenforceable and the portuguese depended on assistance from the british royal navy and what became known as the blockade of africa to enforce their ban on the slave trade this coincided with a series of renewed military expeditions into the bush by the midnineteenth century portugal had established its dominion as far north as the congo river and as far south as mossâmedes until the late 1880s portugal entertained proposals to link angola with its colony in mozambique but was blocked by british and belgian opposition in this period the portuguese came up against different forms of armed resistance from various peoples in angola the berlin conference in 18841885 set the colonys borders delineating the boundaries of portuguese claims in angola although many details were unresolved until the 1920s trade between portugal and its african territories rapidly increased as a result of protective tariffs leading to increased development and a wave of new portuguese immigrants between 1939 and 1943 the portuguese army carried out operations against the nomadic mucubal people accused of rebellion which led to the death of half their population the survivors were incarcerated in concentration camps sent to forced labor camps where the great majority of them perished due to the brutality of the work system undernourishment and executions angolan independence under colonial law black angolans were forbidden from forming political parties or labour unions the first nationalist movements did not take root until after world war ii spearheaded by a largely westernised and portuguesespeaking urban class which included many mestiços during the early 1960s they were joined by other associations stemming from ad hoc labour activism in the rural workforce portugals refusal to address increasing angolan demands for selfdetermination provoked an armed conflict which erupted in 1961 with the baixa de cassanje revolt and gradually evolved into a protracted war of independence that persisted for the next twelve years throughout the conflict three militant nationalist movements with their own partisan guerrilla wings emerged from the fighting between the portuguese government and local forces supported to varying degrees by the portuguese communist party the national front for the liberation of angola fnla recruited from bakongo refugees in zaire benefiting from particularly favourable political circumstances in léopoldville and especially from a common border with zaire angolan political exiles were able to build up a power base among a large expatriate community from related families clans and traditions people on both sides of the border spoke mutually intelligible dialects and enjoyed shared ties to the historical kingdom of kongo though as foreigners skilled angolans could not take advantage of mobutu sese sekos state employment programme some found work as middlemen for the absentee owners of various lucrative private ventures the migrants eventually formed the fnla with the intention of making a bid for political power upon their envisaged return to angola a largely ovimbundu guerrilla initiative against the portuguese in central angola from 1966 was spearheaded by jonas savimbi and the national union for the total independence of angola unita it remained handicapped by its geographic remoteness from friendly borders the ethnic fragmentation of the ovimbundu and the isolation of peasants on european plantations where they had little opportunity to mobilise during the late 1950s the rise of the marxistleninist popular movement for the liberation of angola mpla in the east and dembos hills north of luanda came to hold special significance formed as a coalition resistance movement by the angolan communist party the organisations leadership remained predominantly ambundu and courted public sector workers in luanda although both the mpla and its rivals accepted material assistance from the soviet union or the peoples republic of china the former harboured strong antiimperialist views and was openly critical of the united states and its support for portugal this allowed it to win important ground on the diplomatic front soliciting support from nonaligned governments in morocco ghana guinea mali and the united arab republic the mpla attempted to move its headquarters from conakry to léopoldville in october 1961 renewing efforts to create a common front with the fnla then known as the union of angolan peoples upa and its leader holden roberto roberto turned down the offer when the mpla first attempted to insert its own insurgents into angola the cadres were ambushed and annihilated by upa partisans on robertos orderssetting a precedent for the bitter factional strife which would later ignite the angolan civil war angolan civil war throughout the war of independence the three rival nationalist movements were severely hampered by political and military factionalism as well as their inability to unite guerrilla efforts against the portuguese between 1961 and 1975 the mpla unita and the fnla competed for influence in the angolan population and the international community the soviet union and cuba became especially sympathetic towards the mpla and supplied that party with arms ammunition funding and training they also backed unita militants until it became clear that the latter was at irreconcilable odds with the mpla the collapse of portugals estado novo government following the 1974 carnation revolution suspended all portuguese military activity in africa and the brokering of a ceasefire pending negotiations for angolan independence encouraged by the organisation of african unity holden roberto jonas savimbi and mpla chairman agostinho neto met in mombasa in early january 1975 and agreed to form a coalition government this was ratified by the alvor agreement later that month which called for general elections and set the countrys independence date for 11 november 1975 all three factions however followed up on the ceasefire by taking advantage of the gradual portuguese withdrawal to seize various strategic positions acquire more arms and enlarge their militant forces the rapid influx of weapons from numerous external sources especially the soviet union and the united states as well as the escalation of tensions between the nationalist parties fueled a new outbreak of hostilities with tacit american and zairean support the fnla began massing large numbers of troops in northern angola in an attempt to gain military superiority meanwhile the mpla began securing control of luanda a traditional ambundu stronghold sporadic violence broke out in luanda over the next few months after the fnla attacked mpla forces in march 1975august 2023 the fighting intensified with street clashes in april and may and unita became involved after over two hundred of its members were massacred by an mpla contingent that june an upswing in soviet arms shipments to the mpla influenced a decision by the central intelligence agency to likewise provide substantial covert aid to the fnla and unita in august 1975 the mpla requested direct assistance from the soviet union in the form of ground troops the soviets declined offering to send advisers but no troops however cuba was more forthcoming and in late september dispatched nearly five hundred combat personnel to angola along with sophisticated weaponry and supplies by independence there were over a thousand cuban soldiers in the country they were kept supplied by a massive airbridge carried out with soviet aircraft the persistent buildup of cuban and soviet military aid allowed the mpla to drive its opponents from luanda and blunt an abortive intervention by zairean and south african troops which had deployed in a belated attempt to assist the fnla and unita the fnla was largely annihilated after the decisive battle of quifangondo although unita managed to withdraw its civil officials and militia from luanda and seek sanctuary in the southern provinces from there savimbi continued to mount a determined insurgent campaign against the mpla between 1975 and 1991 the mpla implemented an economic and political system based on the principles of scientific socialism incorporating central planning and a marxistleninist oneparty state it embarked on an ambitious programme of nationalisation and the domestic private sector was essentially abolished privately owned enterprises were nationalised and incorporated into a single umbrella of stateowned enterprises known as unidades economicas estatais uee under the mpla angola experienced a significant degree of modern industrialisation however corruption and graft also increased and public resources were either allocated inefficiently or simply embezzled by officials for personal enrichment the ruling party survived an attempted coup détat by the maoistoriented communist organisation of angola oca in 1977 which was suppressed after a series of bloody political purges left thousands of oca supporters dead the mpla abandoned its former marxist ideology at its third party congress in 1990 and declared social democracy to be its new platform angola subsequently became a member of the international monetary fund restrictions on the market economy were also reduced in an attempt to draw foreign investment by may 1991 it reached a peace agreement with unita the bicesse accords which scheduled new general elections for september 1992 when the mpla secured a major electoral victory unita objected to the results of both the presidential and legislative vote count and returned to war following the election the halloween massacre occurred from 30 october to 1 november where mpla forces killed thousands of unita supporters 21st century on 22 february 2002 government troops killed savimbi in a skirmish in the moxico province unita and the mpla consented to the luena memorandum of understanding in april unita agreed to give up its armed wing with the elections in 2008 and 2012 an mplaruled dominantparty system emerged with unita and the fnla as opposition parties angola has a serious humanitarian crisis the result of the prolonged war of the abundance of minefields and the continued political agitation in favour of the independence of the exclave of cabinda carried out in the context of the protracted cabinda conflict by the flec while most of the internally displaced have now squatted around the capital in musseques shanty towns the general situation for angolans remains desperate a drought in 2016 caused the worst food crisis in southern africa in 25 years affecting 14 million people across seven of angolas eighteen provinces food prices rose and acute malnutrition rates doubled impacting over 95000 children josé eduardo dos santos stepped down as president of angola after 38 years in 2017 being peacefully succeeded by joão lourenço santos chosen successor some members of the dos santos family were later linked to high levels of corruption in july 2022 expresident josé eduardo dos santos died in spain in august 2022 the ruling party mpla won another majority and president lourenço won a second fiveyear term in the election however the election was the tightest in angolas history geography at 1246700 angola is the worlds twentyfourth largest country  comparable in size to mali or twice the size of france or of texas it lies mostly between latitudes 4 and 18s and longitudes 12 and 24e angola borders namibia to the south zambia to the east the democratic republic of the congo to the northeast and the south atlantic ocean to the west the coastal exclave of cabinda in the north has borders with the republic of the congo to the north and with the democratic republic of the congo to the south angola has a favorable coastline for maritime trade with four natural harbors luanda lobito moçâmedes and porto alexandre these natural indentations contrast with africas typical coastline of rocky cliffs and deep bays angolas capital luanda lies on the atlantic coast in the northwest of the country angola had a 2018 forest landscape integrity index mean score of 83510 ranking it 23rd globally out of 172 countries climate like the rest of tropical africa angola experiences distinct alternating rainy and dry seasons in the north the rainy season may last for as long as seven monthsusually from september to april with perhaps a brief slackening in january or february in the south the rainy season begins later in november and lasts until about february the dry season cacimbo is often characterized by a heavy morning mist in general precipitation is higher in the north but at any latitude it is greater in the interior than along the coast and increases with altitude temperatures fall with distance from the equator and with altitude and tend to rise closer to the atlantic ocean thus at soyo at the mouth of the congo river the average annual temperature is about 26 c but it is under 16 c at huambo on the temperate central plateau the coolest months are july and august in the middle of the dry season when frost may sometimes form at higher altitudes administrative divisions march 2016 angola is divided into eighteen provinces províncias and 162 municipalities the municipalities are further divided into 559 communes townships the provinces are exclave of cabinda with an area of approximately 7283 the northern angolan province of cabinda is unusual in being separated from the rest of the country by a strip some 60 wide of the democratic republic of congo along the lower congo river cabinda borders the congo republic to the north and northnortheast and the drc to the east and south the town of cabinda is the chief population centre according to a 1995 census cabinda had an estimated population of 600000 approximately 400000 of whom are citizens of neighboring countries population estimates are however highly unreliable consisting largely of tropical forest cabinda produces hardwoods coffee cocoa crude rubber and palm oil the product for which it is best known however is its oil which has given it the nickname the kuwait of africa cabindas petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of angolas output most of the oil along its coast was discovered under portuguese rule by the cabinda gulf oil company cabgoc from 1968 onwards ever since portugal handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of angola to the local independence groups mpla unita and fnla the territory of cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the government of angola which has employed its armed forces the faaforças armadas angolanas and cabindan separatists wildlife government and politics the angolan government is composed of three branches of government executive legislative and judicial the executive branch of the government is composed of the president the vicepresidents and the council of ministers the legislative branch comprises a 220seat unicameral legislature the national assembly of angola elected from multimember provincewide and nationwide constituencies using partylist proportional representation for decades political power has been concentrated in the presidency after 38 years of rule in 2017 president dos santos stepped down from mpla leadership the leader of the winning party at the parliamentary elections in august 2017 would become the next president of angola the mpla selected the former defense minister joão lourenço as santos chosen successor in what has been described as a political purge to cement his power and reduce the influence of the dos santos family lourenço subsequently sacked the chief of the national police ambrósio de lemos and the head of the intelligence service apolinário josé pereira both are considered allies of former president dos santos he also removed isabel dos santos daughter of the former president as head of the countrys state oil company sonangol in august 2020 josé filomeno dos santos son of angolas former president was sentenced for five years in jail for fraud and corruption constitution the constitution of 2010 establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens the legal system is based on portuguese law and customary law but is weak and fragmented and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities a supreme court serves as the appellate tribunal a constitutional court does not hold the powers of judicial review governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by the president after the end of the civil war the regime came under pressure from within as well as from the international community to become more democratic and less authoritarian its reaction was to implement a number of changes without substantially changing its character the new constitution adopted in 2010 did away with presidential elections introducing a system in which the president and the vicepresident of the political party that wins the parliamentary elections automatically become president and vicepresident directly or indirectly the president controls all other organs of the state so there is de facto no separation of powers in the classifications used in constitutional law this government falls under the category of authoritarian regime

civil war but began to recover after 2002 angolas economy has in recent years moved on from the disarray caused by a quartercentury of angolan civil war to become the fastestgrowing economy in africa and one of the fastestgrowing in the world with an average gdp growth of 20 between 2005 and 2007 in the period 200110 angola had the worlds highest annual average gdp growth at 111 in 2004 the exim bank of china approved a 2 billion line of credit to angola to be used for rebuilding angolas infrastructure and to limit the influence of the international monetary fund there china is angolas biggest trade partner and export destination as well as a significant source of imports bilateral trade reached 2767 billion in 2011 up 115 yearonyear chinas imports mainly crude oil and diamonds increased 91 to 2489 billion while chinas exports to angola including mechanical and electrical products machinery parts and construction materials surged 388 the oil glut led to a local price for unleaded gasoline of 037 a gallon as of 2021 the biggest import partners were the european union followed by china togo the united states and brazil more than half of angolas exports go to china followed by a significantly smaller amount to india the european union and the united arab emirates the angolan economy grew 18 in 2005 26 in 2006 and 176 in 2007 due to the global recession the economy contracted an estimated 03 in 2009 the security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has allowed the resettlement of 4 million displaced persons and a resulting largescale increase in agriculture production angolas economy is expected to grow by 39 per cent in 2014 said the international monetary fund imf robust growth in the nonoil economy mainly driven by a very good performance in the agricultural sector is expected to offset a temporary drop in oil production angolas financial system is maintained by the national bank of angola and managed by the governor jose de lima massano according to a study on the banking sector carried out by deloitte the monetary policy led by banco nacional de angola bna the angolan national bank allowed a decrease in the inflation rate put at 796 in december 2013 which contributed to the sectors growth trend estimates released by angolas central bank said the countrys economy should grow at an annual average rate of 5 per cent over the next four years boosted by the increasing participation of the private sector angola was ranked 132rd in the global innovation index in 2023 although the countrys economy has grown significantly since angola achieved political stability in 2002 mainly due to fastrising earnings in the oil sector angola faces huge social and economic problems these are in part a result of almost continual armed conflict from 1961 on although the highest level of destruction and socioeconomic damage took place after the 1975 independence during the long years of civil war however high poverty rates and blatant social inequality chiefly stems from persistent authoritarianism neopatrimonial practices at all levels of the political administrative military and economic structures and of a pervasive corruption the main beneficiaries are political administrative economic and military power holders who have accumulated and continue to accumulate enormous wealth secondary beneficiaries are the middle strata that are about to become social classes however almost half the population has to be considered poor with dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities where slightly more than 50 of the people residejuly 2021 a study carried out in 2008 by the angolan instituto nacional de estatística found that in rural areas roughly 58 must be classified as poor according to un norms but in the urban areas only 19 and an overall rate of 37 in cities a majority of families well beyond those officially classified as poor must adopt a variety of survival strategiesnovember 2017 in urban areas social inequality is most evident and it is extreme in luanda in the human development index angola constantly ranks in the bottom group in january 2020 a leak of government documents known as the luanda leaks showed that us consulting companies such as boston consulting group mckinsey  company and pricewaterhousecoopers had helped members of the family of former president josé eduardo dos santos especially his daughter isabel dos santos corruptly run sonangol for their own personal profit helping them use the companys revenues to fund vanity projects in france and switzerland after further revelations in the pandora papers former generals dias and do nascimento and former presidential advisers were also accused of misappropriating significant public funds for personal benefit the enormous differences between the regions pose a serious structural problem for the angolan economy illustrated by the fact that about one third of economic activities are concentrated in luanda and neighbouring bengo province while several areas of the interior suffer economic stagnation and even regression one of the economic consequences of social and regional disparities is a sharp increase in angolan private investments abroad the small fringe of angolan society where most of the asset accumulation takes place seeks to spread its assets for reasons of security and profit for the time being the biggest share of these investments is concentrated in portugal where the angolan presence including the family of the state president in banks as well as in the domains of energy telecommunications and mass media has become notable as has the acquisition of vineyards and orchards as well as of tourism enterprises angola has upgraded critical infrastructure an investment made possible by funds from the countrys development of oil resources according to a report just slightly more than ten years after the end of the civil war angolas standard of living has overall greatly improved life expectancy which was just 46 years in 2002 reached 51 in 2011 mortality rates for children fell from 25 per cent in 2001 to 19 per cent in 2010 and the number of students enrolled in primary school has tripled since 2001 however at the same time the social and economic inequality that has characterised the country for so long has not diminished but has deepened in all respects with a stock of assets corresponding to 70 billion kz us68 billion angola is now the thirdlargest financial market in subsaharan africa surpassed only by nigeria and south africa according to the angolan minister of economy abraão gourgel the financial market of the country grew modestly since 2002 and now occupies third place in subsaharan africa on 19 december 2014 the capital market in angola was launched bodiva angola stock exchange and derivatives in english was allocated the secondary public debt market and was expected to launch the corporate debt market by 2015 though the stock market itself was only expected to commence trading in 2016 natural resources the economist reported in 2008 that diamonds and oil make up 60 of angolas economy almost all of the countrys revenue and all of its dominant exports growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed 14 in late 2005 and was expected to grow to 2 by 2007 control of the oil industry is consolidated in sonangol group a conglomerate owned by the angolan government in december 2006 angola was admitted as a member of opec in 2022 the country produced an average of 1165 million barrels of oil per day according to its national oil gas and biofuels agency anpg according to the heritage foundation a conservative american think tank oil production from angola has increased so significantly that angola now is chinas biggest supplier of oil china has extended three multibillion dollar lines of credit to the angolan government two loans of 2 billion from china exim bank one in 2004 the second in 2007 as well as one loan in 2005 of 29 billion from china international fund ltd growing oil revenues also created opportunities for corruption according to a recent human rights watch report 32 billion us dollars disappeared from government accounts in 20072010 furthermore sonangol the staterun oil company controls 51 of cabindas oil due to this market control the company ends up determining the profit received by the government and the taxes it pays the council of foreign affairs states that the world bank mentioned that sonangol is a taxpayer it carries out quasifiscal activities it invests public funds and as concessionaire it is a sector regulator this multifarious work program creates conflicts of interest and characterises a complex relationship between sonangol and the government that weakens the formal budgetary process and creates uncertainty as regards the actual fiscal stance of the state in 2002 angola demanded compensation for oil spills allegedly caused by chevron corporation the first time it had fined a multinational corporation operating in its waters operations in its diamond mines include partnerships between staterun endiama and mining companies such as alrosa which operate in angola access to biocapacity in angola is higher than world average in 2016 angola had 19 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory slightly more than world average of 16 global hectares per person in 2016 angola used 101 global hectares of biocapacity per person  their ecological footprint of consumption this means they use about half as much biocapacity as angola contains as a result angola is running a biocapacity reserve agriculture agriculture and forestry is an area of potential opportunity for the country the african economic outlook organization states that angola requires 45 million tonnes a year of grain but grows only about 55 of the maize it needs 20 of the rice and just 5 of its required wheat in addition the world bank estimates that less than 3 per cent of angolas abundant fertile land is cultivated and the economic potential of the forestry sector remains largely unexploited before independence in 1975 angola was a breadbasket of southern africa and a major exporter of bananas coffee and sisal but three decades of civil war destroyed fertile countryside left it littered with landmines and drove millions into the cities the country now depends on expensive food imports mainly from south africa and portugal while more than 90 of farming is done at the family and subsistence level thousands of angolan smallscale farmers are trapped in poverty transport transport in angola consists of angola centers its port trade in five main ports namibe lobito soyo cabinda and luanda the port of luanda is the largest of the five as well as being one of the busiest on the african continent two transafrican automobile routes pass through angola the tripolicape town highway and the beiralobito highway travel on highways outside of towns and cities in angola and in some cases within isfebruary 2022 often not best advised for those without fourbyfour vehicles while reasonable road infrastructure has existed within angola time and war have taken their toll on the road surfaces leaving many severely potholed littered with broken asphalt in many areas drivers have established alternative tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road the angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the countrys roads the road between lubango and namibe for example was completed recently with funding from the european union and is comparable to many european main routes completing the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades but substantial efforts are already being madejuly 2020 telecommunications the telecommunications industry is considered one of the main strategic sectors in angola in october 2014 the building of an optic fiber underwater cable was announced this project aims to turn angola into a continental hub thus improving internet connections both nationally and internationally on 11 march 2015 the first angolan forum of telecommunications and information technology was held in luanda under the motto the challenges of telecommunications in the current context of angola to promote debate on topical issues on telecommunications in angola and worldwide a

launched from the baikonur space center in kazakhstan on board a zenit 3f rocket the satellite was built by russias rsc energia a subsidiary of the staterun space industry player roscosmos the satellite payload was supplied by airbus defence  space due to an onboard power failure during solar panel deployment on 27 december rsc energia revealed that they lost communications contact with the satellite although subsequent attempts to restore communications with the satellite were successful the satellite eventually stopped sending data and rsc energia confirmed that angosat1 was inoperable the launch of angosat1 was aimed at ensuring telecommunications throughout the country according to aristides safeca secretary of state for telecommunications the satellite was aimed at providing telecommunications services tv internet and egovernment and was expected to remain in operation at best for 18 years a replacement satellite named angosat2 was pursued and was expected to be in service by 2020 as of february 2021 angosat2 was about 60 ready the officials reported the launch was expected in about 17 months by july 2022 the launch of angosat2 occurred on 12 october 2022december 2023 technology the management of the toplevel domain ao passed from portugal to angola in 2015 following new legislation a joint decree of minister of telecommunications and information technologies josé carvalho da rocha and the minister of science and technology maria cândida pereira teixeira states that under the massification of that angolan domain conditions are created for the

independence in 1975 although since the beginning of the anticolonial fight in 1961 the portuguese colonial authorities expelled a series of protestant missionaries and closed mission stations based on the belief that the missionaries were inciting proindependence sentiments missionaries have been able to return to the country since the early 1990s although security conditions due to the civil

eight years the government reports that a percentage of pupils are not attending due to a lack of school buildings and teachers pupils are often responsible for paying additional schoolrelated expenses including fees for books and supplies in 1999 the gross primary enrollment rate was 74 per cent and in 1998 the most recent year for which data are available the net primary enrollment rate was 61 per cent gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of pupils formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance there continue to be significant disparities in enrollment between rural and urban areas in 1995 712 per cent of children ages 7 to 14 years were attending school it is reported that higher percentages of boys

teachers may reportedly demand payment or bribes directly from their pupils other factors such as the presence of landmines lack of resources and identity papers and poor health prevent children from regularly attending school although budgetary allocations for education were increased in 2004 the education system in angola continues to be extremely underfunded according to estimates by the unesco

of angolan students continued to be admitted every year at high schools polytechnical institutes and universities in portugal and brazil through bilateral agreements in general these students belong to the elites in september 2014 the angolan ministry of education announced an investment of 16 million euros in the computerisation of over 300 classrooms across the country the project also includes training teachers at a national level as a way to introduce and use new information technologies in primary schools thus reflecting an improvement in the quality of teaching in 2010 the angolan government started building the angolan media libraries network distributed throughout several provinces in the country to facilitate the peoples access to information and knowledge each site has a bibliographic archive multimedia resources and computers with internet access as well as areas for reading researching and socialising the plan envisages the establishment of one media library in each angolan province by 2017 the project also includes the implementation of several media libraries in order to provide the several contents available in the fixed media libraries to the most isolated populations in the country at this time the mobile media libraries are already operating in the provinces of luanda malanje uíge cabinda and lunda south as for rema the provinces of luanda benguela

century in this urban culture portuguese heritage has become more and more dominant african roots are evident in music and dance and is moulding the way in which portuguese is spoken this process is well reflected in contemporary angolan literature especially in the works of angolan authors in 2014 angola resumed the national festival of angolan culture after a 25year break the festival took place in all the provincial capitals and lasted for 20 days with the theme culture as a factor of peace and development media cinema in 1972 one of angolas first feature films sarah maldorors

high international oil prices and rising oil production contributed to strong economic growth although with high inequality at that time 2022 trade surplus was 30b2012 48b corruption is rife throughout the economy and the country remains heavily dependent on the oil sector which in 2017 accounted for over 90 percent of exports by value and 64 percent of government revenue with the end of the oil boom from 2015 angola entered into a period of economic contraction history the angolan economy has been dominated by the production of raw materials and the use of cheap labor since european rule began in the sixteenth century the portuguese used angola principally as a source for the thriving slave trade across the atlantic luanda became the greatest slaving port in africa after the portuguese empire abolished the slave trade in angola in 1858 it began using concessional agreements granting exclusive rights to a private company to exploit land people and all other resources within a given territory in mozambique this policy spawned a number of companies notorious for their exploitation of local labor but in angola only diamang showed even moderate success at the same time portuguese began emigrating to angola to establish farms and plantations fazendas to grow cash crops for export although these farms were only partially successful before world war ii they formed the basis for the later economic growth the principal exports of the postslave economy in the 19th century were rubber beeswax and ivory prior to the first world war exportation of coffee palm kernels and oil cattle leather and hides and salt fish joined the principal exports with small quantities of gold and cotton also being produced grains sugar and rum were also produced for local consumption the principal imports were foodstuffs cotton goods hardware and british coal legislation against foreign traders was implemented in the 1890s the territorys prosperity however continued to depend on plantations worked by labor indentured from the interior before world war ii the portuguese government was concerned primarily with keeping its colonies selfsufficient and therefore invested little capital in angolas local economy it built no roads until the mid1920s and the first railroad the benguela railway was not completed until 1929 between 1900 and 1940 only 35000 portuguese emigrants settled in angola and most worked in commerce in the cities facilitating trade with portugal in the rural areas portuguese settlers often found it difficult to make a living because of fluctuating world prices for sugarcane and sisal and the difficulties in obtaining cheap labor to farm their crops as a result they often suspended their operations until the market prices rose and instead marketed the produce of angolan farmers but in the wake of world war ii the rapid growth of industrialization worldwide and the parallel requirements for raw materials led portugal to develop closer ties with its colonies and to begin actively developing the angolan economy in the 1930s portugal started to develop closer trade ties with its colonies and by 1940 it absorbed 63 percent of angolan exports and accounted for 47 percent of angolan imports up from 39 percent and 37 percent respectively a decade earlier when the price of angolas principal cropscoffee and sisaljumped after the war the portuguese government began to reinvest some profits inside the country initiating a series of projects to develop infrastructure during the 1950s portugal built dams hydroelectric power stations and transportation systems in addition portuguese citizens were encouraged to emigrate to angola where planned settlements colonatos were established for them in the rural areas finally the portuguese initiated mining operations for iron ore manganese and copper to complement industrial activities at home and in 1955 the first successful oil wells were drilled in angola by 1960 the angolan economy had been completely transformed boasting a successful commercial agricultural sector a promising mineral and petroleum production enterprise and an incipient manufacturing industry yet by 1976 these encouraging developments had been reversed the economy was in complete disarray in the aftermath of the war of independence and the subsequent internal fighting of the liberation movements according to the ruling mplapt in august 1976 more than 80 percent of the agricultural plantations had been abandoned by their portuguese owners only 284 out of 692 factories continued to operate more than 30000 mediumlevel and highlevel managers technicians and skilled workers had left the country and 2500 enterprises had been closed 75 percent of which had been abandoned by their owners furthermore only 8000 vehicles remained out of 153000 registered dozens of bridges had been destroyed the trading network was disrupted administrative services did not exist and files and studies were missing angolas economic ills can also be traced to the legacy of portuguese colonial development many of the white settlers had come to angola after 1950 and were understandably quick to repatriate during the war of independence during their stay however these settlers had appropriated angolan lands disrupting local peasant production of cash and subsistence crops moreover angolas industries depended on trade with portugalthe colonys overwhelmingly dominant trade partnerfor both markets and machinery only the petroleum and diamond industries boasted a wider clientele for investment and markets most important the portuguese had not trained angolans to operate the larger industrial or agricultural enterprises nor had they actively educated the population upon independence angola thus found itself without markets or expertise to maintain even minimal economic growth as a result the government intervened nationalizing most businesses and farms abandoned by the portuguese it established state farms to continue producing coffee sugar and sisal and it took over the operations of all factories to maintain production these attempts usually failed primarily because of the lack of experienced managers and the continuing disruptions in rural areas caused by the unita insurgency only the petroleum sector continued to operate successfully and by 1980 this sector had helped the gross domestic product reach us36 billion its highest level up to 1988 in the face of serious economic problems and the continuing war throughout the countryside in 1987 the government announced plans to liberalize economic policies and promote private investment and involvement in the economy 1990s united nations angola verification mission iii and monua spent us15 billion overseeing

fighting actions in the black hawk war the texasindian wars the mexicanamerican war the utah war and the american civil war considered by confederate states president jefferson davis to be the finest general officer in the confederacy before the later emergence of robert e lee he was killed early in the civil war at the battle of shiloh on april 6 1862 johnston was the highestranking officer on either side killed during the entire war davis believed the loss of general johnston was the turning point of our fate johnston was unrelated to confederate general joseph e johnston early life and education johnston was born in washington kentucky the youngest son of dr john and abigail harris johnston his father was a native of salisbury connecticut although albert johnston was born in kentucky he lived much of his life in texas which he considered his home he was first educated at transylvania university in lexington kentucky where he met fellow student jefferson davis both were

a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd us infantry johnston was assigned to posts in new york and missouri in august 1827 he participated in the expedition to capture red bird the rebellious winnebago chief johnston later wrote i must confess that i consider red bird one of the noblest and most dignified men i ever saw he said i have offended i sacrifice myself to save my country johnston served in the brief black hawk war of 1832 as chief of staff to brevet brigadier general henry atkinson the commander praised johnston for talents of the first order a gallant soldier by profession and education and a gentleman of high standing and integrity marriage and family in 1829 he married henrietta preston sister of kentucky politician and future civil war general william preston they had three children of whom two survived to adulthood their son william preston johnston became a colonel in the confederate states army the senior johnston resigned his commission in 1834 to care for his dying wife in kentucky who succumbed two years later to tuberculosis after serving as secretary of war for the republic of texas in 183840 johnston resigned and went back to kentucky in 1843 he

the republic of texas army on august 5 1836 on january 31 1837 he became senior brigadier general in command of the texas army on february 5 1837 johnston fought in a duel with texas brigadier general felix huston who was angered and offended by johnstons promotion huston had been the acting commander of the army and perceived johnstons appointment as a slight from the texas government johnston was shot through the hip and severely wounded requiring him to relinquish his post during his recovery afterwards johnston said he fought huston as a public duty he had but little respect for the practice of dueling he believed that the safety of the republic depended upon the efficiency of the army and upon the good discipline and subordination of the troops which could only be secured by their obedience to their legal commander general huston embodied the lawless spirit in the army which had to be met and controlled at whatever personal peril many years later huston said that the duel was a shameful piece of business and i wouldnt do it again under any circumstances why when i reflect upon the circumstances i hate myself that one act blackened all the good ones of my life but i couldnt challenge congress and president houston although a duelist was too far above me in rank well thank god i didnt kill him on december 22 1838 mirabeau b lamar the second president of the republic of texas appointed johnston as secretary of war he defended the texas border against mexican attempts to recover the state in rebellion in 1839 he campaigned against native americans in northern texas during the cherokee war of 183839 at the battle of the neches johnston and vice president david g burnet were both cited in the commanders report for active exertions on the field and having behaved in such a manner as reflects great credit upon themselves in february 1840 he resigned and returned to kentucky united states army when the united states declared war on mexico in may 1846 johnston rode 400 miles from his home in galveston to port isabel to volunteer for service in brigadier general zachary taylors army of occupation johnston was elected as colonel of the 1st texas rifle volunteers but the enlistments of his soldiers ran out just before the armys advance on monterrey so taylor appointed him as the inspector general of brigadier general william o butlers division of volunteers johnston convinced a few volunteers of his former regiment to stay on and fight during the battle of monterrey butler was wounded and carried to the rear and johnston assumed an active leadership role in the division future us general joseph hooker was with johnston at monterrey and wrote it was through johnstons agency mainly that our division was saved from a cruel slaughter the coolness and magnificent presence he displayed on this field left an impression on my mind that i have never forgotten general taylor considered johnston the best soldier he had ever commanded johnston resigned from the army just after the battle of monterrey in october 1846 he had promised his wife eliza that he would only volunteer for six months service in addition president james k polks administrations preference for officers associated with the democratic party prevented the promotion of those such as johnston who were perceived as whigs he remained on his plantation after the war until he was appointed by later 12th president zachary taylor to the us army as a major and was made a paymaster in december 1849 for a district of texas encompassing the military posts from the upper colorado river to the upper trinity river he served in that role for more than five years making six tours and traveling more than 4000 annually on the indian frontier of texas he served on the texas frontier at fort mason and elsewhere in the western united states in 1855 14th president franklin pierce appointed him colonel of the new 2nd us cavalry the unit that preceded the modern 5th us a new regiment which he organized his lieutenant colonel being robert e lee and his majors william j hardee and george h thomas other subordinates in this unit included earl van dorn edmund kirby smith nathan g evans innis n palmer george stoneman rw johnson john b hood and charles w field all future civil war generals on 31 march 1856 johnston received a promotion to temporary command of the entire department of texas he campaigned aggressively against the comanche writing to his daughter that the indians harass our frontiers and the 2nd cavalry and other troops thrash them wherever they catch them in march 1857 brigadier general david e twiggs was appointed permanent commander of the department and johnston returned to his position as colonel of the 2nd cavalry utah war as a key figure in the utah war johnston took command of the us forces dispatched to crush the mormon rebellion in november 1857 their objective was to install alfred cumming as governor of the utah territory replacing brigham young and restore us legal authority in the region as johnston had replaced brigadier general william s harney in command he only joined the army after it had already departed for utah johnstons adjutant general and future us general in the civil war major fitz john porter wrote experienced on the plains and of established reputation for energy courage and resources johnstons presence restored confidence at all points and encouraged the weakhearted and panicstricken multitude the long chain of wagons kinked tangled and hard to move uncoiled and went forward smoothly johnston worked tirelessly over the next few months to maintain the effectiveness of his army in the harsh winter environment at fort bridger wyoming major porter wrote to an associate col johnston has done everything to add to the efficiency of the command  and put it in a condition to sustain the dignity and honor of the country  more he cannot do dont let any one come here over col johnston  it would be much against the wishes and hopes of everyone here  who would gladly see him a brigadier general even the mormons commended johnstons actions with the salt lake city deseret news reporting that it takes a cool brain and good judgment to maintain a contented army and healthy camp through a stormy winter in the wasatch mountains johnston and his troops hoped for war they had learned of the mountain meadows massacre and wanted revenge against the mormons however a peaceful resolution was reached after the army had endured the harsh winter at fort bridger in late june 1858 johnston led the army through salt lake city without incident to establish camp floyd some 50 miles distant in a report to the war department johnston reported that horrible crimes have been perpetrated in this territory crimes of a magnitude and of an apparently studied refinement in atrocity hardly to be conceived of and which have gone unwhipped of justice nevertheless johnstons army peacefully occupied the utah territory us army commanderinchief major general winfield scott was delighted with johnstons performance during the campaign and recommended his promotion to brevet brigadier general colonel johnston is more than a good officer  he is a god send to the country thro the army the senate confirmed johnstons promotion on 24 march 1858 with regard to the relations established by johnston with the native american tribes of the area major porter reported that colonel johnston took every occasion to bring the indians within knowledge and influence of the army and induced numerous chiefs to come to his camp colonel johnston was ever kind but firm and dignified to them the utes piutes bannocks and other tribes visited colonel johnston and all went away expressing themselves pleased assuring him that so long as he remained they would prove his friends which the colonel told them would be best for them thus he effectively destroyed all influence of the mormons over them and insured friendly treatment to travelers to and from california and oregon in august 1859 parts of johnstons army of utah were implicated as participants in an alleged massacre at spring valley a retaliation against an indian massacre of an emigrant train to california there are conflicting reports of the event and johnston only referenced it in a november 1859 report to scott he wrote i have ascertained that three emigrant parties were robbed and ten or twelve of their members comprising men women and children murdered the perpetrators of the robbery of the first party were severely chastised by a detachment of dragoons under the command of lieutenant gay the troops failed to discover the robbers of the last two parties that were attacked they are supposed to be vagabonds from the shoshonee sic or snake and bannack sic indians whose chiefs deny any complicity with these predatory bands there is abundant evidence to prove that these robber bands are accompanied by white men and probably instigated and led by them on that account i am inclined to believe the disclaimer of the indians referred to of having any knowledge of the robberies or any share in the plunder the only evidence of the massacre is the account of elijah nicholas wilson written in 1910 about 51 years after the incident and oral histories in late february 1860 johnston received orders from the war department recalling him to washington dc to prepare for a new assignment he spent 1860 in kentucky until december 21 when he sailed for california to take command of the department of the pacific slavery johnston was a slave owner and a strong supporter of slavery by 1846 he owned four slaves in texas in 1855 having discovered that a slave was stealing from the army payroll johnston refused to have him physically punished and instead sold him for 1000 to recoup the losses johnston explained that whipping will not restore what is lost and it will not benefit the culprit whom a lifetime of kind treatment has failed to make honest in 1856 he called abolitionism fanatical idolatrous negro worshipping in a letter to his son fearing that the abolitionists would incite a slave revolt in the southern states upon moving to california johnston sold one slave to his son and freed another randolph or ran who agreed to accompany the family on the condition of a 12month contract for five more years of servitude ran accompanied johnston throughout the american civil war until the latters death johnstons wife eliza celebrated the absence of blacks in california writing where the darky is in any numbers it should be as slaves american civil war at the outbreak of the american civil war johnston was the commander of the us army department of the pacific in california like many regular army officers from the southern united states he opposed secession nevertheless johnston resigned his commission soon after he heard of the confederate states declarations of secession the war department accepted it on may 6 1861 effective may 3 on april 28 he moved to los angeles the home of his wifes brother john griffin considering staying in california with his wife and five children johnston remained there until may a sixth child was born in the family home in los angeles his eldest son capt albert s johnston jr was later killed in an accidental explosion on a steamer ship while on liberty in los angeles in 1863 soon johnston enlisted in the los angeles mounted rifles a prosouthern militia unit as a private leaving warners ranch on may 27 he participated in their trek across the southwestern deserts to texas crossing the colorado river into the confederate territory of arizona on july 4 1861 his escort was commanded by alonzo ridley undersheriff of los angeles who remained at johnstons side until he was killed early in the civil war confederate president jefferson davis decided that the confederacy would attempt to hold as much territory as possible distributing military forces around its borders and coasts in the summer of 1861 davis appointed several generals to defend confederate lines from the mississippi river east to the allegheny mountains aged 58 when the war began johnston was old by army standards he came east to offer his service for the confederacy without having been promised anything merely hoping for an assignment the most sensitive and in many ways the most crucial areas along the mississippi river and in western tennessee along the tennessee and the cumberland rivers were placed under the command of maj gen leonidas polk and brig gen gideon j pillow the latter had initially been in command in tennessee as that states top general their impolitic occupation of columbus kentucky on september 3 1861 two days before johnston arrived in the confederacys capital of richmond virginia after his crosscountry journey drove kentucky from its stated neutrality the majority of kentuckians allied with the us camp polk and pillows action gave us brig gen ulysses s grant an excuse to take control of the strategically located town of paducah kentucky without raising the ire of most kentuckians and the prous majority in the state legislature confederate command in western theater on september 10 1861 johnston was assigned to command the huge area of the confederacy west of the allegheny mountains except for coastal areas he became commander of the confederacys western armies in the area often called the western department or western military department johnstons appointment as a full general by his friend and admirer jefferson davis had already been confirmed by the confederate senate on august 31 1861 the appointment had been backdated to rank from may 30 1861 making him the secondhighestranking general in the confederate states army only adjutant general and inspector general samuel cooper ranked ahead of him after his appointment johnston immediately headed for his new territory he was permitted to call on arkansas tennessee and mississippi governors for new troops however politics largely stifled this authority especially concerning mississippi on september 13 1861 johnston ordered brig gen felix zollicoffer with 4000 men to occupy cumberland gap in kentucky to block us troops from coming into eastern tennessee the kentucky legislature had voted to side with the united states after the occupation of columbus by polk by september 18 johnston had brig gen simon bolivar buckner with another 4000 men blocking the railroad route to tennessee at bowling green kentucky johnston had fewer than 40000 men spread throughout kentucky tennessee arkansas and missouri of these 10000 were in missouri under missouri state guard maj gen sterling price johnston did not quickly gain many recruits when he first requested them from the governors but his more serious problem was lacking sufficient arms and ammunition for the troops he already had as the confederate government concentrated efforts on the units in the east they gave johnston small numbers of reinforcements and minimal amounts of arms and material johnston maintained his defense by conducting raids and other measures to make it appear he had larger forces than he did a strategy that worked for several months johnstons tactics had so annoyed and confused us brig gen william tecumseh sherman in kentucky that he became paranoid and mentally unstable sherman overestimated johnstons forces and was relieved by brig gen don carlos buell on november 9 1861 however in his memoirs sherman strongly refutes this account battle of mill springs east tennessee a heavily prous region of the southern us during the civil war was occupied for the confederacy by two unimpressive brigadier generals appointed by jefferson davis felix zollicoffer a brave but untrained and inexperienced officer and soontobe maj gen george b crittenden a former us army officer with apparent alcohol problems while crittenden was away in richmond zollicoffer moved his forces to the north bank of the upper cumberland river near mill springs now nancy kentucky putting the river to his back and his forces into a trap zollicoffer decided it was impossible to obey orders to return to the other side of the river because of the scarcity of transport and proximity of us troops when us brig gen george h thomas moved against the confederates crittenden decided to attack one of the two parts of thomass command at logans cross roads near mill springs before the us forces could unite at the battle of mill springs on january 19 1862 the illprepared confederates after a night march in the rain attacked the us soldiers with some initial success as the battle progressed zollicoffer was killed and the confederates were turned back and routed by a us bayonet charge suffering 533 casualties from their force of 4000 while crittendens conduct in the battle was so inept that subordinates accused him of being drunk the confederate troops who escaped were assigned to other units as general crittenden faced an investigation of his conduct after the confederate defeat at mill springs davis sent johnston a brigade and a few other scattered reinforcements he also assigned him gen p g t beauregard who was supposed to attract recruits because of his victories early in the war and act as a competent subordinate for johnston the brigade was led by brig gen john b floyd considered incompetent he took command at fort donelson as the senior general present just before us brig gen ulysses s grant attacked the fort historians believe the assignment of beauregard to the west stimulated us commanders to attack the forts before beauregard could make a difference in the theater us army officers heard that he was bringing 15 regiments with him but this was an exaggeration of his forces fort henry fort donelson nashville based on the assumption that kentucky neutrality would act as a shield against a direct invasion from the north circumstances that no longer applied in september 1861 tennessee initially had sent men to virginia and concentrated defenses in the mississippi valley even before johnston arrived in tennessee construction of two forts had been started to defend the tennessee and the cumberland rivers which provided avenues into the state from the north both forts were located in tennessee to respect kentucky neutrality but these were not in ideal locations fort henry on the tennessee river was in an unfavorable lowlying location commanded by hills on the kentucky side of the river fort donelson on the cumberland river although in a better location had a vulnerable land side and did not have enough heavy artillery to defend against gunboats maj gen polk ignored the problems of the forts when he took command after johnston took command polk at first refused to comply with johnstons order to send an engineer lt joseph k dixon to inspect the forts after johnston asserted his authority polk had to allow dixon to proceed dixon recommended that the forts be maintained and strengthened although they were not in ideal locations because much work had been done on them and the confederates might not have time to build new ones johnston accepted his recommendations johnston wanted major alexander p stewart to command the forts but president davis appointed brig gen lloyd tilghman as commander to prevent polk from dissipating his forces by allowing some men to join a partisan group johnston ordered him to send brig gen gideon pillow and 5000 men to fort donelson pillow took up a position at nearby clarksville tennessee and did not move into the fort until february 7 1862 alerted by a us reconnaissance on january 14 1862 johnston ordered tilghman to fortify the high ground opposite fort henry which polk had failed to do despite johnstons orders tilghman failed to act decisively on these orders which were too late to be adequately carried out in any event gen beauregard arrived at johnstons headquarters at bowling green on february 4 1862 and was given overall command of polks force at the western end of johnstons line at columbus kentucky on february 6 1862 us gunboats quickly reduced the defenses of illsited fort henry inflicting 21 casualties on the small remaining confederate force brig gen lloyd tilghman surrendered the 94 remaining officers and men of his approximately 3000man force which had not been sent to fort donelson before grants us forces could even take up their positions johnston knew he could be trapped at bowling green if fort donelson fell so he moved his force to nashville the capital of tennessee and an increasingly important confederate industrial center beginning on february 11 1862 johnston also reinforced fort donelson with 12000 more men including those under floyd and pillow a curious decision given his thought that the us gunboats alone could take the fort he ordered the fort commanders to evacuate the troops if the fort could not be held the senior generals sent to the fort to command the enlarged garrison gideon j pillow and john b floyd squandered their chance to avoid having to surrender most of the garrison and on february 16 1862 brig gen simon buckner having been abandoned by floyd and pillow surrendered fort donelson colonel nathan bedford forrest escaped with his cavalry force of about 700 men before the surrender the confederates suffered about 1500 casualties with an estimated 12000 to 14000 taken prisoner us casualties were 500 killed 2108 wounded and 224 missing johnston who had little choice in allowing floyd and pillow to take charge at fort donelson based on seniority after he ordered them to add their forces to the garrison took the blame and suffered calls for his removal because a full explanation to the press and public would have exposed the weakness of the confederate position his passive defensive performance while positioning himself in a forward position at bowling green spreading his forces too thinly not concentrating his forces in the face of us advances and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the time and by later historians the fall of the forts exposed nashville to an imminent attack and it fell without resistance to us forces under brig gen buell on february 25 1862 two days after johnston had to pull his forces out to avoid having them captured as well concentration at corinth johnston was in a perilous situation after the fall of ft donelson and henry with barely 17000 men to face an overwhelming concentration of union force he hastily fled south into mississippi by way of nashville and then into northern alabama johnston himself retreated with the force under his personal command the army of central kentucky from the vicinity of nashville with beauregards help johnston decided to concentrate forces with those formerly under polk and now already under beauregards command at the strategically located railroad crossroads of corinth mississippi which he reached by a circuitous route johnston kept the us forces now under the overall command of maj gen henry halleck confused and hesitant to move allowing johnston to reach his objective undetected he scraped together reinforcements from louisiana as well as part of polks force at island no 10 and 10000 additional troops under braxton bragg brought up from mobile bragg at least calmed the nerves of beauregard and polk who had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior forces before johnstons arrival on march 24 1862 johnstons army of 17000 men gave the confederates a combined force of about 40000 to 44669 men at corinth on march 29 1862 johnston officially took command of this combined force which continued to use the army of the mississippi name under which beauregard had organized it on march 5 johnstons only hope was to crush grant before buell and others could reinforce him he started his army in motion on april 3 intent on surprising grants force as soon as the next day it was not an easy undertaking his army had been hastily thrown together twothirds of the soldiers had never fired a shot in battle and drill discipline and staff work were so poor that the different divisions kept stumbling into each other on the march beauregard felt that this offensive was a mistake and could not possibly succeed but johnston replied i would fight them if they were a million as he drove his army on to pittsburg landing his army was finally in position within a mile or two of grants force undetected by the evening of april 5 1862 battle of shiloh and death johnston launched a massive surprise attack with his concentrated forces against grant at the battle of shiloh on april 6 1862 as the confederate forces overran the us camps johnston personally rallied troops up and down the line on his horse one of his famous moments in the battle occurred when he witnessed some of his soldiers breaking from the ranks to pillage and loot the us camps and was outraged to see a young lieutenant among them none of that sir johnston roared at the officer we are not here for plunder then realizing he had embarrassed the man he picked up a tin cup from a table and announced let this be my share of the spoils today before directing his army onward at about 230 pm while leading one of those charges against a us camp near the peach orchard he was wounded taking a bullet behind his right knee the bullet clipped a part of his popliteal artery and his boot filled up with blood no medical personnel were on the scene since johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded confederate troops and us prisoners earlier in the battle within a few minutes johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting among his staff was isham g harris the governor of tennessee who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that abraham lincoln had appointed andrew johnson as military governor of tennessee seeing johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale harris asked general are you wounded johnston glanced down at his leg wound then faced harris and said his last words in a weak voice yes and i fear seriously harris and other staff officers removed johnston from his horse carried him to a small ravine near the hornets nest and desperately tried to aid the general who had lost consciousness harris then sent an aide to fetch johnstons surgeon but did not apply a tourniquet to johnstons wounded leg a few minutes later johnston died from blood loss before a doctor could be found it is believed that johnston may have lived for as long as one hour after receiving his fatal wound ironically it was later discovered that johnston had a tourniquet in his pocket when he diedharris and the other officers wrapped general johnstons body in a blanket to not damage the troops morale with the sight of the dead general johnston and his wounded horse fire eater were taken to his field headquarters on the corinth road where his body remained in his tent for the remainder of the battle p g t beauregard assumed command of the army he resumed leading the confederate assault which continued advancing and pushed the us forces back to a final defensive line near the tennessee river with his army exhausted and daylight almost gone beauregard called off the final confederate attack around 1900 hours figuring he could finish off the us army the following morning however grant was reinforced by 20000 fresh troops from don carlos buells army of the ohio during the night and led a successful counterattack the following day driving the confederates from the field and winning the battle as the confederate army retreated to corinth johnstons body was taken to the home of colonel william inge which had been his headquarters in corinth it was covered in the confederate flag and lay in state for several hours it is possible that a confederate soldier fired the fatal round as many confederates were firing at the us lines while johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers alonzo ridley of los angeles commanded the bodyguard the guides of gen a s johnston and was by his side when he fell johnston was the highestranking fatality of the war on either side and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the confederacy at the time davis considered him the best general in the country legacy and honors johnston was survived by his wife eliza and six children his wife and five younger children including one born after he went to war chose to live out their days at home in los angeles with elizas brother dr john strother griffin johnstons eldest son albert sidney jr born in texas had already followed him into the confederate states army in 1863 albert jr was on his way out of san pedro harbor on a ferry after taking home leave in los angeles while a steamer was taking on passengers from the ferry a wave swamped the smaller boat causing its boilers to explode albert jr was killed in the accident upon his passing general johnston received the highest praise ever given by the confederate government accounts were published on december 20 1862 and after that in the los angeles star of his familys hometown johnston street hancock street and griffin avenue each in northeast los angeles are named after the general and his family who lived in the neighborhood johnston was initially buried in new orleans in 1866 a joint resolution of the texas legislature was passed to have his body moved and reinterred at the texas state cemetery in austin the reinterment occurred in 1867 forty years later the state appointed elisabet ney to design a monument and sculpture of him to be erected at the grave site installed in 1905 the texas historical commission has erected a historical marker near the entrance of what was once johnstons plantation an adjacent marker was erected by the san jacinto chapter of the daughters of the republic of texas and the lee roberts and davis chapter of the united daughters of the confederate states of america in 1916 the university of texas at austin recognized several confederate veterans including johnston with statues on its south mall on august 21 2017 as part of the wave of confederate monument removals in america johnstons statue was taken down plans were announced to add it to the briscoe center for american history on the east side of the university campus johnston was inducted to the texas military hall of honor in 1980 in the fall of 2018 a s johnston elementary school in dallas texas was renamed cedar crest elementary johnston middle school in

the term android appears in us patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature humanlike toy automatons the term android was used in a more modern sense by the french author auguste villiers de lisleadam in his work tomorrows eve 1886 featuring an artificial humanoid robot named hadaly the term made an impact into english pulp science fiction starting from jack williamsons the cometeers 1936 and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by edmond hamiltons captain future stories 19401944 although karel čapeks robots in rur rossums universal robots 1921the play that introduced the word robot to the worldwere organic artificial humans the word robot has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans animals and other beings the term android can mean either one of these while a cyborg cybernetic organism or bionic man would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts the term droid popularized by george lucas in the original star wars film and now used widely within science fiction originated as an abridgment of android but has been used by lucas and others to mean any robot including distinctly nonhuman form machines like r2d2 the word android was used in star trek the original series episode what are little girls made of the abbreviation andy coined as a pejorative by writer philip k dick in his novel do androids dream of electric sheep has seen some further usage such as within the tv series total recall 2070 while the term android is used in reference to humanlooking robots in general not necessarily malelooking humanoid robots a robot with a female appearance can also be referred to as a gynoid besides one can refer to robots without alluding to their sexual appearance by calling them anthrobots a portmanteau of anthrōpos and robot see anthrobotics or anthropoids short for anthropoid robots the term humanoids is not appropriate because it is already commonly used to refer to humanlike organic species in the context of science fiction futurism and speculative astrobiology authors have used the term android in more diverse ways than robot or cyborg in some fictional works the difference between a robot and android is only superficial with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robotlike internal mechanics in other stories authors have used the word android to mean a wholly organic yet artificial creation other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between eric g wilson who defines an android as a synthetic human being distinguishes between three types of android based on their bodys composition although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts simulacra devices that exhibit likeness and automata devices that have independence projects several projects aiming to create androids that look and to a certain degree speak or act like a human being have been launched or are underway japan japanese robotics have been leading the field since the 1970s waseda university initiated the wabot project in 1967 and in 1972 completed the wabot1 the first android a fullscale humanoid intelligent robot its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs and to grip and transport objects with hands using tactile sensors its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors artificial eyes and ears and its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in japanese with an artificial mouth in 1984 wabot2 was revealed and made a number of improvements it was capable of playing the organ wabot2 had ten fingers and two feet and was able to read a score of music it was also able to accompany a person in 1986 honda began its humanoid research and development program to create humanoid robots capable of interacting successfully with humans the intelligent robotics lab directed by hiroshi ishiguro at osaka university and the kokoro company demonstrated the actroid at expo 2005 in aichi prefecture japan and released the telenoid r1 in 2010 in 2006 kokoro developed a new der 2 android the height of the human body part of der2 is 165 cm there are 47 mobile points der2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body the air servosystem which kokoro developed originally is used for the actuator as a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise der2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder outwardly der2 has a more beautiful proportion compared to the previous model der2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions once programmed it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice the intelligent mechatronics lab directed by hiroshi kobayashi at the tokyo university of science has developed an android head called saya which was exhibited at robodex 2002 in yokohama japan there are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future now saya is working at the science university of tokyo as a guide the waseda university japan and ntt docomos manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shapeshifting robot wd2 it is capable of changing its face at first the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline eyes nose and so on of a certain person the robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions they say the first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003 after that a year later they made a couple of major improvements to the design the robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy it uses a driving system with a 3dof unit the wd2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask with each point possessing three degrees of freedom this one has 17 facial points for a total of 56 degrees of freedom as for the materials they used the wd2s mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called septom with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point driven by a dc motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw apparently the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces to copy a face they need only a 3d scanner to determine the locations of an individuals 17 facial points after that they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards in addition the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individuals hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3d mask singapore prof nadia thalmann a nanyang technological university scientist directed

on how to talk and engage she collects data through conversations direct data inputs such as books or articles and through internet sources maria bot was built by an international hightech company for barry to help improve education quality and eliminate education poverty maria bot is designed to create new ways for students to engage and discuss ethical issues raised by the increasing presence of robots and artificial intelligence barry also uses maria bot to demonstrate that programming a robot with lifeaffirming ethical framework makes them more likely to help humans to do the same maria bot

staple of science fiction isaac asimov pioneered the fictionalization of the science of robotics and artificial intelligence notably in his 1950s series i robot one thing common to most fictional androids is that the reallife technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly humanlike robotssuch as the creation of strong artificial intelligenceare assumed to have been solved fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humansmoving thinking and speaking as fluidly as them the tension between the nonhuman substance and the human appearanceor even human ambitionsof androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions some android heroes seek like pinocchio to become human as in the film bicentennial man or data in star trek the next generation others as in the film westworld rebel against abuse by careless humans android hunter deckard in do androids dream of electric sheep and its film adaptation blade runner discovers that his targets appear to be in some ways more human than he is android stories therefore are not essentially stories about androids they are stories about the human condition and what it means to be human one aspect of writing about the meaning of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as a mechanism for exploring racism in society as in blade runner perhaps the clearest example of this is john brunners 1968 novel into the slave nebula where the blueskinned android slaves are explicitly shown to be fully human more recently the androids bishop and annalee call in the films aliens and alien resurrection are used as vehicles for exploring how humans deal with the presence of an other the 2018 video game detroit become human also explores how androids are treated as second class citizens in a near future society female androids or gynoids are often seen in science fiction and can be viewed as a continuation of the long tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical perfect woman examples include the greek myth of pygmalion and the female robot maria in fritz langs metropolis some gynoids like pris in blade runner are designed as sexobjects with the intent of pleasing mens violent sexual desires or as submissive servile companions such as in the stepford wives fiction about gynoids has therefore been described as reinforcing essentialist ideas of femininity although others have suggested that the treatment of androids is a way of exploring racism and misogyny in society the 2015 japanese film sayonara starring geminoid f was promoted as the first movie to feature an android performing opposite a human actor see also references further reading external links alberta categories alberta 1905 establishments in canada

and is one of the three prairie provinces alberta borders british columbia to the west saskatchewan to the east the northwest territories to the north and the us state of montana to the south it is one of the only two landlocked provinces in canada with saskatchewan being the other the eastern part of the province is occupied by the great plains while the western part borders the rocky mountains the province has a predominantly continental climate but experiences quick temperature changes due to air aridity seasonal temperature swings are less pronounced in western alberta due to occasional chinook winds alberta is the fourth largest province by area at 661848 and the fourth most populous being home to 4262635 people albertas capital is edmonton while calgary is its largest city the two are albertas largest census metropolitan areas more than half of albertans live in either edmonton or calgary which contributes to continuing the rivalry between the two cities english is the official language of the province in 2016 760 of albertans were anglophone 18 were francophone and 222 were allophone albertas economy is based on hydrocarbons petrochemical industries livestock and agriculture the oil and gas industry has been a pillar of albertas economy since 1947 when substantial oil deposits were discovered at leduc no 1 well it has also become a part of the provinces identity since alberta is the province most rich in hydrocarbons it provides 70 of the oil and natural gas produced on canadian soil in 2018 albertas output was 3382 billion 1527 of canadas gdp until the 1930s albertas political landscape consisted of 2 major parties the centreleft liberals and the agrarian united farmers of alberta today alberta is generally perceived as a conservative province the rightwing social credit party held office continually from 1935 to 1971 before the centreright progressive conservatives held office continually from 1971 to 2015 the latter being the longest unbroken run in government at the provincial or federal level in canadian history since before becoming part of canada alberta has been home to several first nations like plains indians and woodland cree it was also a territory used by fur traders of the rival companies hudsons bay company and north west company the dominion of canada bought the lands that would become alberta as part of the nwt in 1870 from the late 1800s to early 1900s many immigrants arrived to prevent the prairies from being annexed by the us growing wheat and cattle ranching also became very profitable in 1905 the alberta act was passed creating the province of alberta massive oil reserves were discovered in 1947 the exploitation of oil sands began in 1967 alberta is renowned for its natural beauty richness in

an area of 661848 is the fourthlargest province after quebec ontario and british columbia albertas southern border is the 49th parallel north which separates it from the us state of montana the 60th parallel north divides alberta from the northwest territories the 110th meridian west separates it from the province of saskatchewan while on the west its boundary with british columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the northwest territories at 60n until it reaches the continental divide at the rocky mountains and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the continental divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the montana border at 49n the province extends 1223 north to south and 660 east to west at its maximum width its highest point is 3747 at the summit of mount columbia in the rocky mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is 152 on the slave river in wood buffalo national park in the northeast with the exception of the semiarid climate of the steppe in the southeastern section the province has adequate water resources there are numerous rivers and lakes in alberta used for swimming fishing and a range of water sports there are three large lakes lake claire 1436 in wood buffalo national park lesser slave lake 1168 and lake athabasca 7898 which lies in both alberta and saskatchewan the longest river in the province is the athabasca river which travels 1538 from the columbia icefield in the rocky mountains to lake athabasca the largest river is the peace river with an average flow of 2100 the peace river originates in the rocky mountains of northern british columbia and flows through northern alberta and into the slave river a tributary of the mackenzie river albertas capital city edmonton is located at about the geographic centre of the province it is the most northerly major city in canada and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern canada with its proximity to canadas largest oil fields the region has most of western canadas oil refinery capacity calgary is about 280 south of edmonton and 240 north of montana surrounded by extensive ranching country almost 75 of the provinces population lives in the calgaryedmonton corridor the land grant policy to the railways served as a means to populate the province in its early years most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest while the rocky mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely temperate coniferous forests of the alberta mountain forests and albertabritish columbia foothills forests the southern quarter of the province is prairie ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it the central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests from calgary north to edmonton and then east to lloydminster contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population much of the unforested part of alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming with mixed farming more common in the north and centre while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south the alberta badlands are located in southeastern alberta where the red deer river crosses the flat prairie and farmland and features deep canyons and striking landforms dinosaur provincial park near brooks showcases the badlands terrain desert flora and remnants from albertas past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape climate alberta extends for over 1200 from north to south its climate therefore varies considerably average high temperatures in january range from 0 in the southwest to 24 in the far north the presence of the rocky mountains also influences the climate to the southwest which disrupts the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province casting a rain shadow over much of alberta the northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the pacific ocean cause alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean annual precipitation ranges from 300 in the southeast to 450 in the north except in the foothills of the rocky mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach 600 annually northern alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate the agricultural area of southern alberta has a semiarid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants the southeastern corner of alberta part of the palliser triangle experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province and as a result suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts western alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter chinook winds central and parts of northwestern alberta in the peace river region are largely aspen parkland a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north alberta has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters the province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north which often produce cold winter conditions as the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across alberta the temperature can change rapidly arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from 54 in northern alberta to 46 in southern alberta although temperatures at these extremes are rare in the summer continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from 32 in the mountains to over 40 in southeastern alberta alberta is a sunny province annual bright sunshine totals range between 1900 up to just under 2600 hours per year northern alberta gets about 18 hours of daylight in the summer the average daytime temperatures range from around 21 in the rocky mountain valleys and far north up to around 28 in the dry prairie of the southeast the northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures the south and eastcentral portions are prone to droughtlike conditions sometimes persisting for several years although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation sometimes resulting in flooding in the winter the alberta clipper a type of intense fastmoving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream descends over the rest of southern canada and the northern tier of the united states in southwestern alberta the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period during one chinook recorded at pincher creek temperatures soared from 19 in just one hour the region around lethbridge has the most chinooks averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year calgary has a 56 chance of a white christmas while edmonton has an 86 chance after saskatchewan alberta experiences the most tornadoes in canada with an average of 15 verified per year thunderstorms some of them severe are frequent in the summer especially in central and southern alberta the region surrounding the calgaryedmonton corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in canada which is caused by orographic lifting from the nearby rocky mountains enhancing the updraftdowndraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail ecology flora in central and northern alberta the arrival of spring is marked by the early flowering of the prairie crocus pulsatilla nuttalliana anemone this member of the buttercup family has been recorded flowering as early as march though april is the usual month for the general population other prairie flora known to flower early are the golden bean thermopsis rhombifolia and wild rose rosa acicularis members of the sunflower helianthus family blossom on the prairie in the summer months between july and september the southern and east central parts of alberta are covered by short prairie grass which dries up as summer lengthens to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower ratibida fleabane and sage artemisia both yellow and white sweet clover melilotus can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province the trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides these are largely deciduous typically aspen poplar and willow many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain north of the north saskatchewan river evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres aspen poplar balsam poplar populus balsamifera or in some parts cottonwood populus deltoides and paper birch betula papyrifera are the primary large deciduous species conifers include jack pine pinus banksiana rocky mountain pine lodgepole pine pinus contorta both white and black spruce and the deciduous conifer tamarack larix laricina fauna the four climatic regions alpine boreal forest parkland and prairie of alberta are home to many different species of animals the south and central prairie was the homeland of the american bison also known as buffalo with its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo the buffalo population was decimated during early settlement but since then buffalo have made a comeback living on farms and in parks all over alberta herbivores are found throughout the province moose mule deer elk and whitetailed deer are found in the wooded regions and pronghorn can be found in the prairies of southern alberta bighorn sheep and mountain goats live in the rocky mountains rabbits porcupines skunks squirrels and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province alberta is home to only one venomous snake species the prairie rattlesnake alberta is home to many large carnivores such as wolves grizzly bears black bears and mountain lions which are found in the mountains and wooded regions smaller carnivores of the canine and feline families include coyotes red foxes canada lynx and bobcats wolverines can also be found in the northwestern areas of the province central and northern alberta and the region farther north are the nesting ground of many migratory birds vast numbers of ducks geese swans and pelicans arrive in alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern alberta eagles hawks owls and crows are plentiful and a huge variety of smaller seed and insecteating birds can be found alberta like other temperate regions is home to mosquitoes flies wasps and bees rivers and lakes are populated with pike walleye whitefish rainbow speckled brown trout and sturgeon native to the province the bull trout is the provincial fish and an official symbol of alberta turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in alberta alberta is the only province in canadaas well as one of the few places in the worldthat is free of norwegian rats since the early 1950s the government of alberta has operated a ratcontrol program which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail in 2006 alberta agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners it is illegal for individual albertans to own or keep norwegian rats of any description the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos universities and colleges and recognized research institutions in 2009 several rats were found and captured in small pockets in southern alberta putting albertas ratfree status in jeopardy a colony of rats was subsequently found in a landfill near medicine hat in 2012 and again in 2014 paleontology alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of late cretaceous dinosaur fossils worldwide taxa are represented by complete fossil skeletons isolated material microvertebrate remains and even mass graves at least 38 dinosaur type specimens were collected in the province the foremost formation oldman formation and dinosaur park formations collectively comprise the judith river group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaurbearing strata in alberta dinosaurbearing strata are distributed widely throughout alberta the dinosaur provincial park area contains outcrops of the dinosaur park formation and oldman formation in albertas central and southern regions are intermittent scollard formation outcrops in the drumheller valley and edmonton regions there are exposed horseshoe canyon facies other formations have been recorded as well like the milk river and foremost formations the latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites additional geologic formations that have produced only a few fossils are the belly river group and st mary river formations of the southwest and the northwestern wapiti formation which contains two pachyrhinosaurus bone beds the bearpaw formation represents strata deposited during a marine transgression dinosaurs are known from this formation but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from older sediments history paleoindians arrived in alberta at least 10000 years ago toward the end of the last ice age they are thought to have migrated from siberia to alaska on a land bridge across the bering strait and then possibly moved down the east side of the rocky mountains through alberta to settle the americas others may have migrated down the coast of british columbia and then moved inland over time they differentiated into various first nations peoples including the plains indians of southern alberta such as those of the blackfoot confederacy and the plains cree who generally lived by hunting buffalo and the more northerly tribes such as the woodland cree and chipewyan who hunted trapped and fished for a living the first europeans to visit alberta were french canadians during the late 18th century working as fur traders french was the predominant language used in some early fur trading forts in the region such as the first fort edmonton in presentday fort saskatchewan after the british arrival in canada approximately half of the province of alberta south of the athabasca river drainage became part of ruperts land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into hudson bay this area was granted by charles ii of england to the hudsons bay company hbc in 1670 and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it the athabasca river and the rivers north of it were not in hbc territory because they drained into the arctic ocean instead of hudson bay and they were prime habitats for furbearing animals the first european explorer of the athabasca region was peter pond who learned of the methye portage which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of ruperts land other north american fur traders formed the north west company nwc of montreal to compete with the hbc in 1779 the nwc occupied the northern part of alberta territory peter pond built fort athabasca on lac la biche in 1778 roderick mackenzie built fort chipewyan on lake athabasca ten years later in 1788 his cousin sir alexander mackenzie followed the north saskatchewan river to its northernmost point near edmonton then setting northward on foot trekked to the athabasca river which he followed to lake athabasca it was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his namethe mackenzie riverwhich he followed to its outlet in the arctic ocean returning to lake athabasca he followed the peace river upstream eventually reaching the pacific ocean and so he became the first european to cross the north american continent north of mexico the extreme southernmost portion of alberta was part of the french and spanish territory of louisiana and was sold to the united states in 1803 in the treaty of 1818 the portion of louisiana north of the fortyninth parallel was ceded to great britain fur trade expanded in the north but bloody battles occurred between the rival hbc and nwc and in 1821 the british government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities the amalgamated hudsons bay company dominated trade in alberta until 1870 when the newly formed canadian government purchased ruperts land northern alberta was included in the northwestern territory until 1870 when it and ruperts land became canadas northwest territories first nations negotiated the numbered treaties with the crown in which the crown gained title to the land that would later become alberta and the crown committed to the ongoing support of the first nations and guaranteed their hunting and fishing rights the most significant treaties for alberta are treaty 6 1876 treaty 7 1877 and treaty 8 1899 the district of alberta was created as part of the northwest territories in 1882 as settlement increased local representatives to the northwest legislative assembly were added after a long campaign for autonomy in 1905 the district of alberta was enlarged and given provincial status with the election of alexander cameron rutherford as the first premier less than a decade later the first world war presented special challenges to the new province as an extraordinary number of volunteers left relatively few workers to maintain services and production over 50 of albertas doctors volunteered for service overseas on

million head of cattle and alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market nearly one half of all canadian beef is produced in alberta alberta is one of the top producers of plains buffalo bison for the consumer market sheep for wool and mutton are also raised wheat and canola are primary farm crops with alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production other grains are also prominent much of the farming is dryland farming often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation continuous cropping in which there is no fallow season is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion across the province the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing farmers typically truck the grain to central points alberta is the leading beekeeping province of canada with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern alberta then migrating north during the summer into the peace river valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed hybrid canola also requires bee pollination and some

deer and edmonton polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products that are shipped all over the world edmontons oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of edmonton the athabasca oil sands surrounding fort mcmurray have estimated unconventional oil reserves approximately equal to the conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world estimated to be 16 trillion barrels 254 km3 many companies employ both conventional strip mining and nonconventional in situ methods to extract the bitumen from the oil sands as of late 2006 there were over 100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern alberta another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil the oil price increases since 2003 have made it profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even a loss by mid2014 rising costs and stabilizing oil prices threatened the economic viability of some projects an example of this was the shelving of the joslyn north project in the athabasca region in may 2014 with concerted effort and support from the provincial government

in addition to buses calgary and edmonton operate light rail transit lrt systems edmonton lrt which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside the downtown core was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in north america while the calgary c train has one of the highest numbers of daily riders of any lrt system in north america rail there are more than 9000 of operating mainline railway in alberta the vast majority of this trackage is owned by the canadian pacific kansas city cpkc and canadian national railway cn companies which operate freight transport across the province additional railfreight service in the province is provided by two shortline railways the battle river railway and forty mile rail passenger trains include via rails canadian torontovancouver and jasperprince rupert trains which use the cn mainline and pass through jasper national park and parallel the yellowhead highway during at least part of their routes the rocky mountaineer operates two sections one from vancouver to banff over cp tracks and a section that travels over cn tracks to jasper road alberta has over 473000 of highways and roads in its road network of which nearly 41000 are pavedjanuary 2023 the main northsouth corridor is highway 2 which begins south of cardston at the carway border crossing and is part of the canamex corridor beginning at the coutts border crossing and ending at lethbridge highway 4 effectively extends interstate 15 into alberta and is the busiest united states gateway to the province highway 3 joins lethbridge to fort macleod and links highway 2 to highway 4 highway 2 travels north through fort macleod calgary red deer and edmonton north of edmonton the highway continues to athabasca then northwesterly along the south shore of lesser slave lake into high prairie north to peace river west to fairview and finally south to grande prairie where it ends at an interchange with highway 43 the section of highway 2 between calgary and edmonton has been named the queen elizabeth ii highway to commemorate the visit of the monarch in 2005 highway 2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it highway 22 west of highway 2 known as cowboy trail and highway 21 east of highway 2 highway 43 travels northwest into grande prairie and the peace river country travelling northeast from edmonton the highway 63 connects to fort mcmurrayand the athabasca oil sands alberta has two main eastwest corridors the southern corridor part of the transcanada highway system enters the province near medicine hat runs westward through calgary and leaves alberta through banff national park the northern corridor also part of the transcanada network and known as the yellowhead highway highway 16 runs west from lloydminster in eastern alberta through edmonton and jasper national park into british columbia one of the most scenic drives is along the icefields parkway which runs for 228 between jasper and lake louise with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length a third corridor stretches across southern alberta highway 3 runs between crowsnest pass and medicine hat through lethbridge and forms the eastern portion of the crowsnest highway another major corridor through central alberta is highway 11 also known as the david thompson highway which runs east from the saskatchewan river crossing in banff national park through rocky mountain house and red deer connecting with highway 12 20 west of stettler the highway connects many of the smaller towns in central alberta with calgary and edmonton as it crosses highway 2 just west of red deer urban stretches of albertas major highways and freeways are often called trails for example highway 2 the main northsouth highway in the province is called deerfoot trail as it passes through calgary but becomes calgary trail southbound and gateway boulevard northbound as it enters edmonton and then turns into st albert trail as it leaves edmonton for the city of st albert calgary in particular has a tradition of calling its largest urban expressways trails and naming many of them after prominent first

actinopterygians is a class of bony fish that comprise over 50 of living vertebrate species they are so called because of their lightly built fins made of webbings of skin supported by radially extended thin bony spines called lepidotrichia as opposed to the bulkier fleshy lobed fins of the sister class sarcopterygii lobefinned fish resembling folding fans the actinopterygian fins can easily change shape and wetted area providing superior thrusttoweight ratios per movement compared to sarcopterygian and chondrichthyian fins the fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements the radials which represent the articulation between these fins and the internal skeleton eg pelvic and pectoral girdles the vast majority of actinopterygians are teleosts by species count they dominate the subphylum vertebrata and constitute nearly 99 of the over 30000 extant species of fish they are the most abundant nektonic aquatic animals and are ubiquitous throughout freshwater and marine environments from the deep sea to subterranean waters to the highest mountain streams extant species can range in size from paedocypris at 8 to the massive ocean sunfish at 2300 and to the giant oarfish at 11 the largest ever known rayfinned fish the extinct leedsichthys from the jurassic has been estimated to have grown to 165 characteristics fileanatomia dei

genitalia gonopodium rayfinned fishes occur in many variant forms the main features of typical rayfinned fish are shown in the adjacent diagram the swim bladder is a more derived structure and used for buoyancy except from the bichirs which just like the lungs of lobefinned fish have retained the ancestral condition of ventral budding from the foregut the swim bladder in rayfinned fishes derives from a dorsal bud above the foregut in early forms the swim bladder could still be used for breathing a trait still present in holostei bowfins and gars in some fish like the arapaima the swim bladder has been modified for breathing air again and in other lineages it have been completely lost rayfinned fishes have many different types of scales but all teleosts have leptoid scales the outer part of these scales fan out with bony ridges while the inner part is crossed with fibrous connective tissue leptoid scales are thinner and more transparent than other types of scales and lack the hardened enamel or dentinelike layers found in the scales of many other fish unlike ganoid scales which are found in nonteleost actinopterygians new scales are added in concentric layers as the fish grows teleosts and chondrosteans sturgeons and paddlefish also differ from the bichirs and holosteans bowfin and gars in having gone through a wholegenome duplication paleopolyploidy the wgd is estimated to have happened about 320 million years ago in the teleosts which on average has retained about 17 of the gene duplicates and around 180 124225 million years ago in the chondrosteans  it has since happened again in some teleost lineages like salmonidae 80100 million years ago and several times independently within the cyprinidae in goldfish and common carp as recently as 14 million years ago body shapes and fin arrangements rayfinned fish vary in size and shape in their feeding specializations and in the number and arrangement of their rayfins reproduction in nearly all rayfinned fish the sexes are separate and in most species the females spawn eggs that are fertilized externally typically with the male inseminating the eggs after they are laid development then proceeds with a freeswimming larval stage however other patterns of ontogeny exist with one of the commonest being sequential hermaphroditism in most cases this involves protogyny fish starting life as females and converting to males at some stage triggered by some internal or external factor protandry where a fish converts from male to female is much less common than protogyny most families use external rather than internal fertilization of the oviparous teleosts most 79 do not provide parental care viviparity ovoviviparity or some form of parental care for eggs whether by the male the female or both parents is seen in a significant fraction 21 of the 422 teleost families no care is likely the ancestral condition the oldest case of viviparity in rayfinned fish is found in middle triassic species of extinctsaurichthys viviparity is relatively rare and is found in about 6 of living teleost species male care is far more common than female care male territoriality preadapts a species for evolving male parental care there are a few examples of fish that selffertilise the mangrove rivulus is an amphibious simultaneous hermaphrodite producing both eggs and spawn and having internal fertilisation this mode of reproduction may be related to the fishs habit of spending long periods out of water in the mangrove forests it inhabits males are occasionally produced at temperatures below 19 and can fertilise eggs that are then spawned by the female this maintains genetic variability in a species that is otherwise highly inbred classification and fossil record actinopterygii is divided into the classes cladistia and actinopteri the latter comprises the subclasses chondrostei and neopterygii the neopterygii in turn is divided into the infraclasses holostei and teleostei during the mesozoic triassic jurassic cretaceous and cenozoic the teleosts in particular diversified widely as a result 96 of living fish species are teleosts 40 of all fish species belong to the teleost subgroup acanthomorpha while all other groups of actinopterygians represent depauperate lineages the classification of rayfinned fishes can be summarized as follows the cladogram below shows the main clades of living actinopterygians and their evolutionary relationships to other extant groups of fishes and the fourlimbed vertebrates tetrapods the latter include mostly terrestrial species but also groups that became secondarily aquatic eg whales and dolphins tetrapods evolved from a group of bony fish during the devonian period approximate divergence dates for the different actinopterygian clades in millions of years mya are from near et al 2012 the polypterids bichirs and reedfish are the sister lineage of all other actinopterygians the acipenseriformes sturgeons and paddlefishes are the sister lineage of neopterygii and holostei bowfin and gars are the sister lineage of teleosts the elopomorpha eels and tarpons appear to be the most basal teleosts the earliest known fossil actinopterygian is andreolepis hedei dating back 420 million years late silurian remains of which have been found in russia sweden and estonia crown group actinopterygians most likely originated near the devoniancarboniferous boundary the earliest fossil relatives of modern teleosts are from the triassic period prohalecites pholidophorus although it is suspected that teleosts originated already during the paleozoic era taxonomy the listing below is a summary of all extinct indicated by a dagger  and living groups of actinopterygii with their respective taxonomic rank the taxonomy follows

ˈalbɛɐt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn 14 march 1879  18 april 1955 was a germanborn theoretical physicist who is widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time best known for developing the theory of relativity einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century his massenergy equivalence formula e which arises from relativity theory has been called the worlds most famous equation he received the 1921 nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory his work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science in a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the british journal physics world einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time his intellectual achievements and originality have made the word einstein broadly synonymous with genius born in the german empire einstein moved to switzerland in 1895 forsaking his german citizenship as a subject of the kingdom of württemberg the following year in 1897 at the age of seventeen he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the swiss federal polytechnic school in zürich graduating in 1900 in 1901 he acquired swiss citizenship which he kept for the rest of his life in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the swiss patent office in bern in 1905 he submitted a successful phd dissertation to the university of zurich in 1914 he moved to berlin in order to join the prussian academy of sciences and the humboldt university of berlin in 1917 he became director of the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics he also became a german citizen again this time as a subject of the kingdom of prussia in 1933 while he was visiting the united states adolf hitler came to power in germany horrified by the nazi war of extermination against his fellow jews einstein decided to remain in the us and was granted american citizenship in 1940 on the eve of world war ii he endorsed a letter to president franklin d roosevelt alerting him to the potential german nuclear weapons program and recommending that the us begin similar research einstein supported the allies but generally viewed the idea of nuclear weapons with great dismay in 1905 sometimes described as his annus mirabilis miracle year einstein published four groundbreaking papers these outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect explained brownian motion introduced his special theory of relativitya theory which addressed the inability of classical mechanics to account satisfactorily for the behavior of the electromagnetic fieldand demonstrated that if the special theory is correct mass and energy are equivalent to each other in 1915 he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation a cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole the middle part of his career also saw him making important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation in which light consists of particles subsequently called photons for much of the last phase of his academic life einstein worked on two endeavors that proved ultimately unsuccessful firstly he advocated against quantum theorys introduction of fundamental randomness into sciences picture of the world objecting that god does not play dice secondly he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism too as a result he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics life and career childhood youth and education albert einstein was born in ulm in the kingdom of württemberg in the german empire on 14 march 1879 his parents secular ashkenazi jews were hermann einstein a salesman and engineer and pauline koch in 1880 the family moved to munichs borough of ludwigsvorstadtisarvorstadt where einsteins father and his uncle jakob founded elektrotechnische fabrik j einstein  cie a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current albert attended a catholic elementary school in munich from the age of five when he was eight he was transferred to the luitpold gymnasium where he received advanced primary and then secondary school education in 1894 hermann and jakobs company tendered for a contract to install electric lighting in munich but without successthey lacked the capital that would have been required to update their technology from direct current to the more efficient alternating current alternative the failure of their bid forced them to sell their munich factory and search for new opportunities elsewhere the einstein family moved to italy first to milan and a few months later to pavia where they settled in palazzo cornazzani einstein then fifteen stayed behind in munich in order to finish his schooling his father wanted him to study electrical engineering but he was a fractious pupil who found the gymnasiums regimen and teaching methods far from congenial he later wrote that the schools policy of strict rote learning was harmful to creativity at the end of december 1894 a letter from a doctor persuaded the luitpolds authorities to release him from its care and he joined his family in pavia while in italy as a teenager he wrote an essay entitled on the investigation of the state of the ether in a magnetic field einstein excelled at physics and mathematics from an early age and soon acquired the mathematical expertise normally only found in a child several years his senior he began teaching himself algebra calculus and euclidean geometry when he was twelve he made such rapid progress that he discovered an original proof of the pythagorean theorem before his thirteenth birthday a family tutor max talmud said that only a short time after he had given the twelve year old einstein a geometry textbook the boy had worked through the whole book he thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics  soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high i could not follow einstein recorded that he had mastered integral and differential calculus while still just fourteen his love of algebra and geometry was so great that at twelve he was already confident that nature could be understood as a mathematical structure at thirteen when his range of enthusiasms had broadened to include music and philosophy einstein was introduced to kants critique of pure reason kant became his favorite philosopher according to his tutor at the time he was still a child only thirteen years old yet kants works incomprehensible to ordinary mortals seemed to be clear to him in 1895 at the age of sixteen einstein sat the entrance examination for the federal polytechnic school later the eidgenössische technische hochschule eth in zürich switzerland he failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the test but performed with distinction in physics and mathematics on the advice of the polytechnics principal he completed his secondary education at the argovian cantonal school a gymnasium in aarau switzerland graduating in 1896 while lodging in aarau with the family of jost winteler he fell in love with wintelers daughter marie his sister maja later married wintelers son paul in january 1896 with his fathers approval einstein renounced his citizenship of the german kingdom of württemberg in order to avoid conscription into military service the matura graduation for the successful completion of higher secondary schooling awarded to him in the september of that year acknowledged him to have performed well across most of the curriculum allotting him a top grade of 6 for history physics algebra geometry and descriptive geometry at seventeen he enrolled in the fouryear mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the federal polytechnic school marie winteler a year older than him took up a teaching post in olsberg switzerland the five other polytechnic school freshmen following the same course as einstein included just one woman a twenty year old serbian mileva marić over the next few years the pair spent many hours discussing their shared interests and learning about topics in physics that the polytechnic schools lectures did not cover in his letters to marić einstein confessed that exploring science with her by his side was much more enjoyable than reading a textbook in solitude eventually the two students became not only friends but also lovers historians of physics are divided on the question of the extent to which marić contributed to the insights of einsteins annus mirabilis publications there is at least some evidence that he was influenced by her scientific ideas but there are scholars who doubt whether her impact on his thought was of any great significance at all marriages relationships and children correspondence between einstein and marić discovered and published in 1987 revealed that in early 1902 while marić was visiting her parents in novi sad she gave birth to a daughter lieserl when marić returned to switzerland it was without the child whose fate is uncertain a letter of einsteins that he wrote in september 1903 suggests that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy einstein and marić married in january 1903 in may 1904 their son hans albert was born in bern switzerland their son eduard was born in zürich in july 1910 in letters that einstein wrote to marie winteler in the months before eduards arrival he described his love for his wife as misguided and mourned the missed life that he imagined he would have enjoyed if he had married winteler instead i think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be in 1912 einstein entered into a relationship with elsa löwenthal who was both his first cousin on his mothers side and his second cousin on his fathers when marić learned of his infidelity soon after moving to berlin with him in april 1914 she returned to zürich taking hans albert and eduard with her einstein and marić were granted a divorce on 14 february 1919 on the grounds of having lived apart for five years as part of the divorce settlement einstein agreed that if he were to win a nobel prize he would give the money that he received to marić he won the prize two years later einstein married löwenthal in 1919 in 1923 he began a relationship with a secretary named betty neumann the niece of his close friend hans mühsam löwenthal nevertheless remained loyal to him accompanying him when he emigrated to the united states in 1933 in 1935 she was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems she died in december 1936 a volume of einsteins letters released by hebrew university of jerusalem in 2006 added further names to the catalog of women with whom he was romantically involved they included margarete lebach a married austrian estella katzenellenbogen the rich owner of a florist business toni mendel a wealthy jewish widow and ethel michanowski a berlin socialite with whom he spent time and from whom he accepted gifts while married to löwenthal after being widowed einstein was briefly in a relationship with margarita konenkova thought by some to be a russian spy her husband the russian sculptor sergei konenkov created the bronze bust of einstein at the institute for advanced study at princetonnovember 2022 following an episode of acute mental illness at about the age of twenty einsteins son eduard was diagnosed with schizophrenia he spent the remainder of his life either in the care of his mother or in temporary confinement in an asylum after her death he was committed permanently to burghölzli the psychiatric university hospital in zürich 19021909 assistant at the swiss patent office einstein graduated from the federal polytechnic school in 1900 duly certified as competent to teach mathematics and physics his successful acquisition of swiss citizenship in february 1901 was not followed by the usual sequel of conscription the swiss authorities deemed him medically unfit for military service he found that swiss schools too appeared to have no use for him failing to offer him a teaching position despite the almost two years that he spent applying for one eventually it was with the help of marcel grossmanns father that he secured a post in bern at the swiss patent office as an assistant examiner  level iii patent applications that landed on einsteins desk for his evaluation included ideas for a gravel sorter and an electric typewriter his employers were pleased enough with his work to make his position permanent in 1903 although they did not think that he should be promoted until he had fully mastered machine technology it is conceivable that his labors at the patent office had a bearing on his development of his special theory of relativity he arrived at his revolutionary ideas about space time and light through thought experiments about the transmission of signals and the synchronization of clocks matters which also figured in some of the inventions submitted to him for assessment in 1902 einstein and some friends whom he had met in bern formed a group that held regular meetings to discuss science and philosophy their choice of a name for their club the olympia academy was an ironic comment upon its far from olympian status sometimes they were joined by marić who limited her participation in their proceedings to careful listening the thinkers whose works they reflected upon included henri poincaré ernst mach and david hume all of whom significantly influenced einsteins own subsequent ideas and beliefs 19001905 first scientific papers einsteins first paper folgerungen aus den capillaritätserscheinungen conclusions drawn from the phenomena of capillarity in which he proposed a model of intermolecular attraction that he afterwards disavowed as worthless was published in the journal annalen der physik in 1900 his 24page doctoral dissertation also addressed a topic in molecular physics titled eine neue bestimmung der moleküldimensionen a new determination of molecular dimensions and dedicated to his friend marcel grossman it was completed on 30 april 1905 and approved by professor alfred kleiner of the university of zurich three months later einstein was formally awarded his phd on 15 january 1906 four other pieces of work that einstein completed in 1905his famous papers on the photoelectric effect brownian motion his special theory of relativity and the equivalence of mass and energyhave led to the years being celebrated as an annus mirabilis for physics almost as wonderful as 1666 the year in which isaac newton experienced his greatest epiphanies the publications deeply impressed einsteins contemporaries 19081933 early academic career einsteins sabbatical as a civil servant approached its end in 1908 when he secured a junior teaching position at the university of bern in 1909 a lecture on relativistic electrodynamics that he gave at the university of zurich much admired by alfred kleiner led to zürichs luring him away from bern with a newly created associate professorship promotion to a full professorship followed in april 1911 when he accepted a chair at the german charlesferdinand university in prague a move which required him to become an austrian citizen of the austrohungarian empire his time in prague saw him producing eleven research papers in july 1912 he returned to his alma mater the eth zurich to take up a chair in theoretical physics his teaching activities there centred on thermodynamics and analytical mechanics and his research interests included the molecular theory of heat continuum mechanics and the development of a relativistic theory of gravitation in his work on the latter topic he was assisted by his friend marcel grossmann whose knowledge of the kind of mathematics required was greater than his own in the spring of 1913 two german visitors max planck and walther nernst called upon einstein in zürich in the hope of persuading him to relocate to berlin they offered him membership of the prussian academy of sciences the directorship of the planned kaiser wilhelm institute for physics and a chair at the humboldt university of berlin that would allow him to pursue his research supported by a professorial salary but with no teaching duties to burden him their invitation was all the more appealing to him because berlin happened to be the home of his latest girlfriend elsa löwenthal he duly joined the academy on 24 july 1913 and moved into an apartment in the berlin district of dahlem on 1 april 1914 he was installed in his humboldt university position shortly thereafter the outbreak of the first world war in july 1914 marked the beginning of einsteins gradual estrangement from the nation of his birth when the manifesto of the ninetythree was published in october 1914a document signed by a host of prominent german thinkers that justified germanys belligerenceeinstein was one of the few german intellectuals to distance himself from it and sign the alternative eirenic manifesto to the europeans instead but this expression of his doubts about german policy did not prevent him from being elected to a twoyear term as president of the german physical society in 1916 and when the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics opened its doors the following yearits foundation delayed because of the wareinstein was appointed its first director just as planck and nernst had promised einstein was elected a foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences in 1920 and a foreign member of the royal society in 1921 in 1922 he was awarded the 1921 nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect at this point some physicists still regarded the general theory of relativity sceptically and the nobel citation displayed a degree of doubt even about the work on photoelectricity that it acknowledged it did not assent to einsteins notion of the particulate nature of light which only won over the entire scientific community when s n bose derived the planck spectrum in 1924 that same year einstein was elected an international honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences britains closest equivalent of the nobel award the royal societys copley medal was not hung around einsteins neck until 1925 he was elected an international member of the american philosophical society in 1930 einstein resigned from the prussian academy in march 1933 his accomplishments in berlin had included the completion of the general theory of relativity proving the einsteinde haas effect contributing to the quantum theory of radiation and the development of boseeinstein statistics 1919 putting general relativity to the test in 1907 einstein reached a milestone on his long journey from his special theory of relativity to a new idea of gravitation with the formulation of his equivalence principle which asserts that an observer in an infinitesimally small box falling freely in a gravitational field would be unable to find any evidence that the field exists in 1911 he used the principle to estimate the amount by which a ray of light from a distant star would be bent by the gravitational pull of the sun as it passed close to the suns photosphere that is the suns apparent surface he reworked his calculation in 1913 having now found a way to model gravitation with the riemann curvature tensor of a noneuclidean fourdimensional spacetime by the fall of 1915 his reimagining of the mathematics of gravitation in terms of riemannian geometry was complete and he applied his new theory not just to the behavior of the sun as a gravitational lens but also to another astronomical phenomenon the precession of the perihelion of mercury a slow drift in the point in mercurys elliptical orbit at which it approaches the sun most closely a total eclipse of the sun that took place on 29 may 1919 provided an opportunity to put his theory of gravitational lensing to the test and observations performed by sir arthur eddington yielded results that were consistent with his calculations eddingtons work was reported at length in newspapers around the world on 7 november 1919 for example the leading british newspaper the times printed a banner headline that read revolution in science  new theory of the universe  newtonian ideas overthrown 19211923 coming to terms with fame with eddingtons eclipse observations widely reported not just in academic journals but by the popular press as well einstein became perhaps the worlds first celebrity scientist a genius who had shattered a paradigm that had been basic to physicists understanding of the universe since the seventeenth century einstein began his new life as an intellectual icon in america where he arrived on 2 april 1921 he was welcomed to new york city by mayor john francis hylan and then spent three weeks giving lectures and attending receptions he spoke several times at columbia university and princeton and in washington he visited the white house with representatives of the national academy of sciences he returned to europe via london where he was the guest of the philosopher and statesman viscount haldane he used his time in the british capital to meet several people prominent in british scientific political or intellectual life and to deliver a lecture at kings college in july 1921 he published an essay my first impression of the usa in which he sought to sketch the american character much as had alexis de tocqueville in democracy in america 1835 he wrote of his transatlantic hosts in highly approving terms what strikes a visitor is the joyous positive attitude to life  the american is friendly selfconfident optimistic and without envy in 1922 einsteins travels were to the old world rather than the new he devoted six months to a tour of asia that saw him speaking in japan singapore and sri lanka then known as ceylon after his first public lecture in tokyo he met emperor yoshihito and his wife at the imperial palace with thousands of spectators thronging the streets in the hope of catching a glimpse of him in a letter to his sons he wrote that japanese people seemed to him to be generally modest intelligent and considerate and to have a true appreciation of art but his picture of them in his diary was less flattering the intellectual needs of this nation seem to be weaker than their artistic ones  natural disposition his journal also contains views of china and india which were uncomplimentary of chinese people he wrote that even the children are spiritless and look obtuse it would be a pity if these chinese supplant all other races for the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary he was greeted with even greater enthusiasm on the last leg of his tour in which he spent twelve days in mandatory palestine newly entrusted to british rule by the league of nations in the aftermath of the first world war sir herbert samuel the british high commissioner welcomed him with a degree of ceremony normally only accorded to a visiting head of state including a cannon salute one reception held in his honor was stormed by people determined to hear him speak he told them that he was happy that jews were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world einsteins decision to tour the eastern hemisphere in 1922 meant that he was unable to go to stockholm in the december of that year to participate in the nobel prize ceremony his place at the traditional nobel banquet was taken by a german diplomat who gave a speech praising him not only as a physicist but also as a campaigner for peace a two week visit to spain that he undertook in 1923 saw him collecting another award a membership of the spanish academy of sciences signified by a diploma handed to him by king alfonso xiii his spanish trip also gave him a chance to meet a fellow nobel laureate the neuroanatomist santiago ramón y cajal 19221932 serving the league of nations from 1922 until 1932 with the exception of a few months in 1923 and 1924 einstein was a member of the genevabased international committee on intellectual cooperation of the league of nations a group set up by the league to encourage scientists artists scholars teachers and other people engaged in the life of the mind to work more closely with their counterparts in other countries he was appointed as a german delegate rather than as a representative of switzerland because of the machinations of two catholic activists oskar halecki and giuseppe motta by persuading secretary general eric drummond to deny einstein the place on the committee reserved for a swiss thinker they created an opening for gonzague de reynold who used his league of nations position as a platform from which to promote traditional catholic doctrine einsteins former physics professor hendrik lorentz and the polish chemist marie curie were also members of the committee 1925 touring south america in march and april 1925 einstein and his wife visited south america where they spent about a week in brazil a week in uruguay and a month in argentina their tour was suggested by jorge duclout 18561927 and mauricio nirenstein 18771935 with the support of several argentine scholars including julio rey pastor jakob laub and leopoldo lugones and was financed primarily by the council of the university of buenos aires and the asociación hebraica argentina argentine hebraic association with a smaller contribution from the argentinegermanic cultural institution 19301931 touring the us in december 1930 einstein began another significant sojourn in the united states drawn back to the us by the offer of a two month research fellowship at the california institute of technology caltech supported him in his wish that he should not be exposed to quite as much attention from the media as he had experienced when visiting the us in 1921 and he therefore declined all the invitations to receive prizes or make speeches that his admirers poured down upon him but he remained willing to allow his fans at least some of the time with him that they requested after arriving in new york city einstein was taken to various places and events including chinatown a lunch with the editors of the new york times and a performance of carmen at the metropolitan opera where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival during the days following he was given the keys to the city by mayor jimmy walker and met nicholas murray butler the president of columbia university who described einstein as the ruling monarch of the mind harry emerson fosdick pastor at new yorks riverside church gave einstein a tour of the church and showed him a fullsize statue that the church made of einstein standing at the entrance also during his stay in new york he joined a crowd of 15000 people at madison square garden during a hanukkah celebration einstein next traveled to california where he met caltech president and nobel laureate robert a millikan his friendship with millikan was awkward as millikan had a penchant for patriotic militarism where einstein was a pronounced pacifist during an address to caltechs students einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good this aversion to war also led einstein to befriend author upton sinclair and film star charlie chaplin both noted for their pacifism carl laemmle head of universal studios gave einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to chaplin they had an instant rapport with chaplin inviting einstein and his wife elsa to his home for dinner chaplin said einsteins outward persona calm and gentle seemed to conceal a highly emotional temperament from which came his extraordinary intellectual energy chaplins film city lights was to premiere a few days later in hollywood and chaplin invited einstein and elsa to join him as his special guests walter isaacson einsteins biographer described this as one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity chaplin visited einstein at his home on a later trip to berlin and recalled his modest little flat and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory chaplin speculated that it was possibly used as kindling wood by the nazis 1933 emigration to the us in february 1933 while on a visit to the united states einstein knew he could not return to germany with the rise to power of the nazis under germanys new chancellor adolf hitler while at american universities in early 1933 he undertook his third twomonth visiting professorship at the california institute of technology in pasadena in february and march 1933 the gestapo repeatedly raided his familys apartment in berlin he and his wife elsa returned to europe in march and during the trip they learned that the german reichstag had passed the enabling act on 23 march transforming hitlers government into a de facto legal dictatorship and that they would not be able to proceed to berlin later on they heard that their cottage had been raided by the nazis and einsteins personal sailboat confiscated upon landing in antwerp belgium on 28 march einstein immediately went to the german consulate and surrendered his passport formally renouncing his german citizenship the nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a hitler youth camp refugee status in april 1933 einstein discovered that the new german government had passed laws barring jews from holding any official positions including teaching at universities historian gerald holton describes how with virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues thousands of jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed a month later einsteins works were among those targeted by the german student union in the nazi book burnings with nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels proclaiming jewish intellectualism is dead one german magazine included him in a list of enemies of the german regime with the phrase not yet hanged offering a 5000 bounty on his head in a subsequent letter to physicist and friend max born who had already emigrated from germany to england einstein wrote  i must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise after moving to the us he described the book burnings as a spontaneous emotional outburst by those who shun popular enlightenment and more than anything else in the world fear the influence of men of intellectual independence einstein was now without a permanent home unsure where he would live and work and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in germany aided by the academic assistance council founded in april 1933 by british liberal politician william beveridge to help academics escape nazi persecution einstein was able to leave germany he rented a house in de haan belgium where he lived for a few months in late july 1933 he visited england for about six weeks at the invitation of the british member of parliament commander oliver lockerlampson who had become friends with him in the preceding years lockerlampson invited him to stay near his cromer home in a secluded wooden cabin on roughton heath in the parish of roughton norfolk to protect einstein lockerlampson had two bodyguards watch over him a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding einstein was published in the daily herald on 24 july 1933 lockerlampson took einstein to meet winston churchill at his home and later austen chamberlain and former prime minister lloyd george einstein asked them to help bring jewish scientists out of germany british historian martin gilbert notes that churchill responded immediately and sent his friend physicist frederick lindemann to germany to seek out jewish scientists and place them in british universities churchill later observed that as a result of germany having driven the jews out they had lowered their technical standards and put the allies technology ahead of theirs einstein later contacted leaders of other nations including turkeys prime minister i̇smet i̇nönü to whom he wrote in september 1933 requesting placement of unemployed germanjewish scientists as a result of einsteins letter jewish invitees to turkey eventually totaled over 1000 saved individuals lockerlampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend british citizenship to einstein during which period einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in europe in one of his speeches he denounced germanys treatment of jews while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting jewish citizenship in palestine as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere in his speech he described einstein as a citizen of the world who should be offered a temporary shelter in the uk both bills failed however and einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey us to become a resident scholar resident scholar at the institute for advanced study on 3 october 1933 einstein delivered a speech on the importance of academic freedom before a packed audience at the royal albert hall in london with the times reporting he was wildly cheered throughout four days later he returned to the us and took up a position at the institute for advanced study noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing nazi germany at the time most american universities including harvard princeton and yale had minimal or no jewish faculty or students as a result of their jewish quotas which lasted until the late 1940s einstein was still undecided on his future he had offers from several european universities including christ church oxford where he stayed for three short periods between may 1931 and june 1933 and was offered a fiveyear research fellowship called a studentship at christ church but in 1935 he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the united states and apply for citizenship einsteins affiliation with the institute for advanced study would last until his death in 1955 he was one of the four first selected along with john von neumann kurt gödel and hermann weyl at the new institute he soon developed a close friendship with gödel the two would take long walks together discussing their work bruria kaufman his assistant later became a physicist during this period einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics both unsuccessfully he lived in princeton at his home from 1935 onwards the albert einstein house was made a national historic landmark in 1976 world war ii and the manhattan project in 1939 a group of hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist leó szilárd attempted to alert washington to ongoing nazi atomic bomb research the groups warnings were discounted einstein and szilárd along with other refugees such as edward teller and eugene wigner regarded it as their responsibility to alert americans to the possibility that german scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb and to warn that hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon to make certain the us was aware of the danger in july 1939 a few months before the beginning of world war ii in europe szilárd and wigner visited einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs which einstein a pacifist said he had never considered he was asked to lend his support by writing a letter with szilárd to president roosevelt recommending the us pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research the letter is believed to be arguably the key stimulus for the us adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the us entry into world war ii in addition to the letter einstein used his connections with the belgian royal family and the belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the white houses oval office some say that as a result of einsteins letter and his meetings with roosevelt the us entered the race to develop the bomb drawing on its immense material financial and scientific resources to initiate the manhattan project for einstein war was a disease  and he called for resistance to war by signing the letter to roosevelt some argue he went against his pacifist principles in 1954 a year before his death einstein said to his old friend linus pauling i made one great mistake in my lifewhen i signed the letter to president roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made but there was some justificationthe danger that the germans would make them  in 1955 einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists including british philosopher bertrand russell signed a manifesto highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons in 1960 einstein was included posthumously as a charter member of the world academy of art and science waas an organization founded by distinguished scientists and intellectuals who committed themselves to the responsible and ethical advances of science particularly in light of the development of nuclear weapons us citizenship einstein became an american citizen in 1940 not long after settling into his career at the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in american culture compared to europe he recognized the right of individuals to say and think what they pleased without social barriers as a result individuals were encouraged he said to be more creative a trait he valued from his early education einstein joined the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp in princeton where he campaigned for the civil rights of african americans he considered racism americas worst disease seeing it as handed down from one generation to the next as part of his involvement he corresponded with civil rights activist w e b du bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial as an alleged foreign agent in 1951 when einstein offered to be a character witness for du bois the judge decided to drop the case in 1946 einstein visited lincoln university in pennsylvania a historically black college where he was awarded an honorary degree lincoln was the first university in the united states to grant college degrees to african americans alumni include langston hughes and thurgood marshall einstein gave a speech about racism in america adding i do not intend to be quiet about it a resident of princeton recalls that einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student einstein has said being a jew myself perhaps i can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination personal views political views in 1918 einstein was one of the signatories of the founding proclamation of the german democratic party a liberal party later in his life einsteins political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism which he detailed in his essays such as why socialism his opinions on the bolsheviks also changed with time in 1925 he criticized them for not having a wellregulated system of government and called their rule a regime of terror and a tragedy in human history he later adopted a more moderated view criticizing their methods but praising them which is shown by his 1929 remark on vladimir lenin einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics he strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nationstates in the framework of a world federation he wrote i advocate world government because i am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most terrible danger in which man has ever found himself the fbi created a secret dossier on einstein in 1932 by the time of his death it was 1427 pages long einstein was deeply impressed by mahatma gandhi with whom he corresponded he described gandhi as a role model for the generations to come the initial connection was established on 27 september 1931 when wilfrid israel took his indian guest v a sundaram to meet his friend einstein at his summer home in the town of caputh sundaram was gandhis disciple and special envoy whom wilfrid israel met while visiting india and visiting the indian leaders home in 1925 during the visit einstein wrote a short letter to gandhi that was delivered to him through his envoy and gandhi responded quickly with his own letter although in the end einstein and gandhi were unable to meet as they had hoped the direct connection between them was established through wilfrid israel relationship with zionism einstein was a figurehead leader in the establishment of the hebrew university of jerusalem which opened in 1925 earlier in 1921 he was asked by the biochemist and president of the world zionist organization chaim weizmann to help raise funds for the planned university he made suggestions for the creation of an institute of agriculture a chemical institute and an institute of microbiology in order to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria which he called an evil that was undermining a third of the countrys development he also promoted the establishment of an oriental studies institute to include language courses given in both hebrew and arabic einstein referred to himself as a member of the zionist movement and supported the right of jewish people to return to palestine but favored a free binational palestine in which jews and arabs would share sovereignty in a 1945 letter to judge jerome frank einstein wrote zionism has also a very good influence on the jewish peoplejews who have a vivid feeling of jewish national solidarity are much better equipped to overcome with dignity all the dangers and hardships which we have to face he continued however i dislike nationalism very much  even jewish nationalism but our own national solidarity is forced upon us by a hostile world and not the aggressive feelings which we connect with the word nationalism in a 1946 letter to maurice dunay he wrote i am in favor of palestine being developed as a jewish homeland but not as a separate state upon the death of israeli president weizmann in november 1952 prime minister david bengurion offered einstein the largely ceremonial position of president of israel at the urging of ezriel carlebach the offer was presented by israels ambassador in washington abba eban who explained that the offer embodies the deepest respect which the jewish people can repose in any of its sons einstein wrote that he was deeply moved but at once saddened and ashamed that he could not accept it religious and philosophical views einstein expounded his spiritual outlook in a wide array of writings and interviews he said he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic god of baruch spinozas philosophy he did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings a view which he described as naïve he clarified however that i am not an atheist preferring to call himself an agnostic or a deeply religious nonbeliever when asked if he believed in an afterlife einstein replied no and one life is enough for me einstein was primarily affiliated with nonreligious humanist and ethical culture groups in both the uk and us he served on the advisory board of the first humanist society of new york and was an honorary associate of the rationalist association which publishes new humanist in britain for the 75th anniversary of the new york society for ethical culture he stated that the idea of ethical culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism he observed without ethical culture there is no salvation for humanity in a germanlanguage letter to philosopher eric gutkind dated 3 january 1954 einstein wrotethe word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses the bible a collection of honorable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish no interpretation no matter how subtle can for me change this  for me the jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions and the jewish people to whom i gladly belong and with whose mentality i have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people  i cannot see anything chosen about them einstein had been sympathetic toward vegetarianism for a long time in a letter in 1930 to hermann huth vicepresident of the german vegetarian federation deutsche vegetarierbund he wrotealthough i have been prevented by outward circumstances from observing a strictly vegetarian diet i have long been an adherent to the cause in principle besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons it is my view that a vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind he became a vegetarian himself only during the last part of his life in march 1954 he wrote in a letter so i am living without fats without meat without fish but am feeling quite well this way it almost seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore love of music einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age in his late journals he wrote his mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into german culture according to conductor leon botstein einstein began playing when he was 5 however he did not enjoy it at that age when he turned 13 he discovered the violin sonatas of mozart whereupon he became enamored of mozarts compositions and studied music more willingly einstein taught himself to play without ever practicing systematically he said that love is a better teacher than a sense of duty at the age of 17 he was heard by a school examiner in aarau while playing beethovens violin sonatas the examiner stated afterward that his playing was remarkable and revealing of great insight  what struck the examiner writes botstein was that einstein displayed a deep love of the music a quality that was and remains in short supply music possessed an unusual meaning for this student music took on a pivotal and permanent role in einsteins life from that period on although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time among those with whom einstein played chamber music were a few professionals including kurt appelbaum and he performed for private audiences and friends chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in bern zürich and berlin where he played with max planck and his son among others he is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the köchel catalog of mozarts work that edition was prepared by alfred einstein who may have been a distant relation in 1931 while engaged in research at the california institute of technology he visited the zoellner family conservatory in los angeles where he played some of beethoven and mozarts works with members of the zoellner quartet near the end of his life when the young juilliard quartet visited him in princeton he played his violin with them and the quartet was impressed by einsteins level of coordination and intonation death on 17 april 1955 einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm which had previously been reinforced surgically by rudolph nissen in 1948 he took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of israels seventh anniversary with him to the hospital but he did not live to complete it einstein refused surgery saying i want to go when i want it is tasteless to prolong life artificially i have done my share it is time to go i will do it elegantly he died in the princeton hospital early the next morning at the age of 76 having continued to work until near the end during the autopsy the pathologist thomas stoltz harvey removed einsteins brain for preservation without the permission of his family in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made einstein so intelligent einsteins remains were cremated in trenton new jersey and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location in a memorial lecture delivered on 13 december 1965 at unesco headquarters nuclear physicist j robert oppenheimer summarized his impression of einstein as a person he was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness  there was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn einstein bequeathed his personal archives library and intellectual assets to the hebrew university of jerusalem in israel scientific career throughout his life einstein published hundreds of books and articles he published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 nonscientific ones on 5 december 2014 universities and archives announced the release of einsteins papers comprising more than 30000 unique documents einsteins intellectual achievements and originality have made the word einstein synonymous with genius in addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the boseeinstein statistics the einstein refrigerator and others 1905  annus mirabilis papers the annus mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect which gave rise to quantum theory brownian motion the special theory of relativity and e  mc2 that einstein published in the annalen der physik scientific journal in 1905 these four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space time and matter the four papers are statistical mechanics thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics einsteins first paper submitted in 1900 to annalen der physik was on capillary attraction it was published in 1901 with the title folgerungen aus den capillaritätserscheinungen which translates as conclusions from the capillarity phenomena two papers he published in 19021903 thermodynamics attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view these papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on brownian motion which showed that brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist his research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena theory of critical opalescence einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density at the critical point this derivative is zero leading to large fluctuations the effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered making the fluid look milky white einstein relates this to rayleigh scattering which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength and which explains why the sky is blue einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations and demonstrated how both the effect and rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter special relativity einsteins zur elektrodynamik bewegter körper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies was received on 30 june 1905 and published 26 september of that same year it reconciled conflicts between maxwells equations the laws of electricity and magnetism and the laws of newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics observationally the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light the theory developed in this paper later became known as einsteins special theory of relativity this paper predicted that when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion this paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aetherone of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the timewas superfluous in his paper on massenergy equivalence einstein produced e  mc2 as a consequence of his special relativity equations einsteins 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years but was accepted by leading physicists starting with max planck einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics the study of moving bodies in 1908 hermann minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime einstein adopted minkowskis formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity general relativity general relativity and the equivalence principle general relativity gr is a theory of gravitation that was developed by einstein between 1907 and 1915 according to it the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of spacetime by those masses general relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape as einstein later said the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion even accelerated ones should appear more satisfactory consequently in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity in that article titled on the relativity principle and the conclusions drawn from it he argued that free fall is really inertial motion and that for a freefalling observer the rules of special relativity must apply this argument is called the equivalence principle in the same article einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation gravitational redshift and gravitational lensing in 1911 einstein published another article on the influence of gravitation on the propagation of light expanding on the 1907 article in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies thus the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally gravitational waves in 1916 einstein predicted gravitational waves ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves traveling outward from the source transporting energy as gravitational radiation the existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it by contrast gravitational waves cannot exist in the newtonian theory of gravitation which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed the first indirect detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars psr b191316 the explanation for the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves einsteins prediction was confirmed on 11 february 2016 when researchers at ligo published the first observation of gravitational waves detected on earth on 14 september 2015 nearly one hundred years after the prediction hole argument and entwurf theory while developing general relativity einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory he formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible he gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only in june 1913 the entwurf draft theory was the result of these investigations as its name suggests it was a sketch of a theory less elegant and more difficult than general relativity with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions after more than two years of intensive work einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in november 1915 physical cosmology in 1917 einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole he discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic either contracting or expanding as observational evidence for a dynamic universe was lacking at the time einstein introduced a new term the cosmological constant into the field equations in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe the modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature in accordance with einsteins understanding of machs principle in these years this model became known as the einstein world or einsteins static universe following the discovery of the recession of the galaxies by edwin hubble in 1929 einstein abandoned his static model of the universe and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos the friedmanneinstein universe of 1931 and the einsteinde sitter universe of 1932 in each of these models einstein discarded the cosmological constant claiming that it was in any case theoretically unsatisfactory in many einstein biographies it is claimed that einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his biggest blunder based on a letter george gamow claimed to have received from him the astrophysicist mario livio has cast doubt on this claim in late 2013 a team led by the irish physicist cormac oraifeartaigh discovered evidence that shortly after learning of hubbles observations of the recession of the galaxies einstein considered a steadystate model of the universe in a hitherto overlooked manuscript apparently written in early 1931 einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter a process that he associated with the cosmological constant as he stated in the paper in what follows i would like to draw attention to a solution to equation 1 that can account for hubbels sic facts and in which the density is constant over time  if one considers a physically bounded volume particles of matter will be continually leaving it for the density to remain constant new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space it thus appears that einstein considered a steadystate model of the expanding universe many years before hoyle bondi and gold however einsteins steadystate model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea energy momentum pseudotensor general relativity includes a dynamical spacetime so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum noethers theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a lagrangian with translation invariance but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry the energy and momentum derived within general relativity by noethers prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates he maintained that the noncovariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field while the use of noncovariant objects like pseudotensors was criticized by erwin schrödinger and others einsteins approach has been echoed by physicists including lev landau and evgeny lifshitz wormholes in 1935 einstein collaborated with nathan rosen to produce a model of a wormhole often called einsteinrosen bridges his motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations in line with the program outlined in the paper do gravitational fields play an important role in the constitution of the elementary particles these solutions cut and pasted schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches because these solutions included spacetime curvature without the presence of a physical body einstein and rosen suggested that they could provide the beginnings of a theory that avoided the notion of point particles however it was later found that einsteinrosen bridges are not stable einsteincartan theory in order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part called the torsion this modification was made by einstein and cartan in the 1920s equations of motion in general relativity gravitational force is reimagined as curvature of spacetime a curved path like an orbit is not the result of a force deflecting a body from an ideal straightline path but rather the bodys attempt to fall freely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other masses a remark by john archibald wheeler that has become proverbial among physicists summarizes the theory spacetime tells matter how to move matter tells spacetime how to curve the einstein field equations cover the latter aspect of the theory relating the curvature of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy the geodesic equation covers the former aspect stating that freely falling bodies follow lines that are as straight as possible in a curved spacetime einstein regarded this as an independent fundamental assumption that had to be postulated in addition to the field equations in order to complete the theory believing this to be a shortcoming in how general relativity was originally presented he wished to derive it from the field equations themselves since the equations of general relativity are nonlinear a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields like a black hole would move on a trajectory which is determined by the einstein field equations themselves not by a new law accordingly einstein proposed that the field equations would determine the path of a singular solution like a black hole to be a geodesic both physicists and philosophers have often repeated the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained from applying the field equations to the motion of a gravitational singularity but this claim remains disputed old quantum theory photons and energy quanta in a 1905 paper einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles quanta einsteins light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists including max planck and niels bohr this idea only became universally accepted in 1919 with robert millikans detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect and with the measurement of compton scattering einstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each where h is plancks constant he did not say much more because he was not sure how the particles were related to the wave but he did suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results notably the photoelectric effect quantized atomic vibrations in 1907 einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator in the einstein model each atom oscillates independentlya series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics peter debye refined this model boseeinstein statistics in 1924 einstein received a description of a statistical model from indian physicist satyendra nath bose based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles einstein noted that boses statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles and submitted his translation of boses paper to the zeitschrift für physik einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications among them the boseeinstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures it was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by eric allin cornell and carl wieman using ultracooling equipment built at the nistjila laboratory at the university of colorado at boulder boseeinstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons einsteins sketches for this project may be seen in the einstein archive in the library of the leiden university waveparticle duality although the patent office promoted einstein to technical examiner second class in 1906 he had not given up on academia in 1908 he became a privatdozent at the university of bern in über die entwicklung unserer anschauungen über das wesen und die konstitution der strahlung the development of our views on the composition and essence of radiation on the quantization of light and in an earlier 1909 paper einstein showed that max plancks energy quanta must have welldefined momenta and act in some respects as independent pointlike particles this paper introduced the photon concept although the name photon was introduced later by gilbert n lewis in 1926 and inspired the notion of waveparticle duality in quantum mechanics einstein saw this waveparticle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new unified foundation zeropoint energy in a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913 planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zeropoint energy in his second quantum theory soon this idea attracted the attention of einstein and his assistant otto stern assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zeropoint energy they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data the numbers matched nicely however after publishing the findings they promptly withdrew their support because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zeropoint energy stimulated emission in 1917 at the height of his work on relativity einstein published an article in physikalische zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser this article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with plancks distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode this paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws matter waves einstein discovered louis de broglies work and supported his ideas which were received skeptically at first in another major paper from this era einstein observed that de broglie waves could explain the quantization rules of bohr and sommerfeld this paper would inspire schrödingers work of 1926 quantum mechanics einsteins objections to quantum mechanics einstein played a major role in developing quantum theory beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect however he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925 despite its acceptance by other physicists he was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism stating that god is not playing at dice until the end of his life he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete bohr versus einstein the bohreinstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between einstein and niels bohr who were two of its founders their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics einsteinpodolskyrosen paradox einstein never fully accepted quantum mechanics while he recognized that it made correct predictions he believed a more fundamental description of nature must be possible over the years he presented multiple arguments to this effect but the one he preferred most dated to a debate with bohr in 1930 einstein suggested a thought experiment in which two objects are allowed to interact and then moved apart a great distance from each other the quantummechanical description of the two objects is a mathematical entity known as a wavefunction if the wavefunction that describes the two objects before their interaction is given then the schrödinger equation provides the wavefunction that describes them after their interaction but because of what would later be called quantum entanglement measuring one object would lead to an instantaneous change of the wavefunction describing the other object no matter how far away it is moreover the choice of which measurement to perform upon the first object would affect what wavefunction could result for the second object einstein reasoned that no influence could propagate from the first object to the second instantaneously fast indeed he argued physics depends on being able to tell one thing apart from another and such instantaneous influences would call that into question because the true physical condition of the second object could not be immediately altered by an action done to the first einstein concluded the wavefunction could not be that true physical condition only an incomplete description of it a more famous version of this argument came in 1935 when einstein published a paper with boris podolsky and nathan rosen that laid out what would become known as the epr paradox in this thought experiment two particles interact in such a way that the wavefunction describing them is entangled then no matter how far the two particles were separated a precise position measurement on one particle would imply the ability to predict perfectly the result of measuring the position of the other particle likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in an equally precise prediction for of the momentum of the other particle without needing to disturb the other particle in any way they argued that no action taken on the first particle could instantaneously affect the other since this would involve information being transmitted faster than light which is forbidden by the theory of relativity they invoked a principle later known as the epr criterion of reality positing that if without in any way disturbing a system we can predict with certainty ie with probability equal to unity the value of a physical quantity then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity from this they inferred that the second particle must have a definite value of both position and of momentum prior to either quantity being measured but quantum mechanics considers these two observables incompatible and thus does not associate simultaneous values for both to any system einstein podolsky and rosen therefore concluded that quantum theory does not provide a complete description of reality in 1964 john stewart bell carried the analysis of quantum entanglement much further he deduced that if measurements are performed independently on the two separated particles of an entangled pair then the assumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a mathematical constraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated this constraint would later be called a bell inequality bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this inequality consequently the only way that hidden variables could explain the predictions of quantum physics is if they are nonlocal which is to say that somehow the two particles are able to interact instantaneously no matter how widely they ever become separated bell argued that because an explanation of quantum phenomena in terms of hidden variables would require nonlocality the epr paradox is resolved in the way which einstein would have liked least despite this and although einstein personally found the argument in the epr paper overly complicated that paper became among the most influential papers published in physical review it is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory unified field theory encouraged by his success with general relativity einstein sought an even more ambitious geometrical theory that would treat gravitation and electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity in 1950 he described his unified field theory in a scientific american article titled on the generalized theory of gravitation his attempt to find the most fundamental laws of nature won him praise but not success a particularly conspicuous blemish of his model was that it did not accommodate the strong and weak nuclear forces neither of which was well understood until many years after his death although most researchers now believe that einsteins approach to unifying physics was mistaken his goal of a theory of everything is one to which his successors still aspire other investigations einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned these pertain to force superconductivity and other research collaboration with other scientists in addition to longtime collaborators leopold infeld nathan rosen peter bergmann and others einstein also had some oneshot collaborations with various scientists einsteinde haas experiment in 1908 owen willans richardson predicted that a change in the magnetic moment of a free body will cause this body to rotate this effect is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum and is strong enough to be observable in ferromagnetic materials einstein and wander johannes de haas published two papers in 1915 claiming the first experimental observation of the effect measurements of this kind demonstrate that the phenomenon of magnetization is caused by the alignment polarization of the angular momenta of the electrons in the material along the axis of magnetization these measurements also allow the separation of the two contributions to the magnetization that which is associated with the spin and with the orbital motion of the electrons einstein as an inventor in 1926 einstein and his former student leó szilárd coinvented and in 1930 patented the einstein refrigerator this absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input on 11 november 1930 1781541 was awarded to einstein and leó szilárd for the refrigerator their invention was not immediately put into commercial production but the most promising of their patents were acquired by the swedish company electrolux einstein also invented an electromagnetic pump sound reproduction device and several other household devices nonscientific legacy while traveling einstein wrote daily to his wife elsa and adopted stepdaughters margot and ilse the letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the hebrew university of jerusalem margot einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death she died in 1986 barbara wolff of the hebrew universitys albert einstein archives told the bbc that there are about 3500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955 einsteins right of publicity was litigated in 2015 in a federal district court in california although the court initially held that the right had expired that ruling was immediately appealed and the decision was later vacated in its entirety the underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled the right is enforceable and the hebrew university of jerusalem is the exclusive representative of that right corbis successor to the roger richman agency licenses the use of his name and associated imagery as agent for the university mount einstein in the chugach mountains of alaska was named in 1955 mount einstein in new zealands paparoa range was named after him in 1970 by the department of scientific and industrial research in popular culture einstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities after the confirmation of his general theory of relativity in 1919 although most of the public had little understanding of his work he was widely recognized and admired in the period before world war ii the new yorker published a vignette in their the talk of the town feature saying that einstein was so well known in america that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain that theory eventually he came to cope with unwanted enquirers by pretending to be someone else pardon me sorry always i am mistaken for professor einstein einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels films plays and works of music he is a favorite model for depictions of absentminded professors his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated time magazines frederic golden wrote that einstein was a cartoonists dream come true many popular quotations are often misattributed to him awards and honors einstein received numerous awards and honors and in 1922 he was awarded the 1921 nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect none of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by alfred nobel so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to einstein in 1922 einsteinium a synthetic chemical element was named in his honor in 1955 a few months after his death publications scientific first of a series of papers on this topic einstein a reprint of this book was published by edition erbrich in 1982 9783886820054 further information about the volumes published so far can be found on the webpages of the einstein papers project and on

pakistan to the east and south iran to the west turkmenistan to the northwest uzbekistan to the north tajikistan to the northeast and china to the northeast and east occupying 652864 of land the country is predominantly mountainous with plains in the north and the southwest which are separated by the hindu kush mountain range kabul is the countrys largest city and serves as its capital according to the world population review 2021 afghanistans population is 402 million the national statistics information authority of afghanistan estimated the population to be 329 million 2020 human habitation in afghanistan dates to the middle paleolithic era popularly referred to as the graveyard of empires the land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns including those by the persians alexander the great the maurya empire arab muslims the mongols the british the soviet union and a usled coalition afghanistan also served as the source from which the grecobactrians and the mughals amongst others rose to form major empires the various conquests and periods in both the iranian and indian cultural spheres made the area a center for zoroastrianism buddhism hinduism and later islam the modern state of afghanistan began with the durrani afghan empire in the 18th century although dost mohammad khan is sometimes considered to be the founder of the first modern afghan state dost mohammad died in 1863 days after his last campaign to unite afghanistan and afghanistan was consequently thrown back into civil war during this time afghanistan became a buffer state in the great game between the british empire and the russian empire from india the british attempted to subjugate afghanistan but were repelled in the first angloafghan war however the second angloafghan war saw a british victory and the successful establishment of british political influence following the third angloafghan war in 1919 afghanistan became free of foreign political hegemony and emerged as the independent kingdom of afghanistan in june 1926 under amanullah khan this monarchy lasted almost half a century until zahir shah was overthrown in 1973 following which the republic of afghanistan was established since the late 1970s afghanistans history has been dominated by extensive warfare including coups invasions insurgencies and civil wars the conflict began in 1978 when a communist revolution established a socialist state and subsequent infighting prompted the soviet union to invade afghanistan in 1979 mujahideen fought against the soviets in the sovietafghan war and continued fighting amongst themselves following the soviets withdrawal in 1989 the islamic fundamentalist taliban controlled most of the country by 1996 but their islamic emirate of afghanistan received little international recognition before its overthrow in the 2001 us invasion of afghanistan the taliban returned to power in 2021 after capturing kabul and overthrowing the government of the islamic republic of afghanistan ending the 20012021 war in september 2021 the taliban reestablished the islamic emirate of afghanistan the taliban government remains internationally unrecognized afghanistan is rich in natural resources including lithium iron zinc and copper it is the second largest producer of cannabis resin and third largest of both saffron and cashmere the country is a member of the south asian association for regional cooperation and a founding member of the organization of islamic cooperation due to the effects of war in recent decades the country has dealt with high levels of terrorism poverty and child malnutrition afghanistan remains among the worlds least developed countries ranking 180th in the human development index afghanistans gross domestic product gdp is 81 billion by purchasing power parity and 201 billion by nominal values per capita its gdp is amongst the lowest of any country 2020 etymology some scholars suggest that the root name afghān is derived from the sanskrit word aśvakan which was the name used for ancient inhabitants of the hindu kush aśvakan literally means horsemen horse breeders or cavalrymen from aśva the sanskrit and avestan words for horse historically the ethnonym afghān was used to refer to ethnic pashtuns the arabic and persian form of the name afġān was first attested in the 10thcentury geography book hudud alalam the last part of the name stan is a persian suffix meaning place of therefore afghanistan translates to land of the afghans or land of the pashtuns in a historical sense according to the third edition of the encyclopedia of islam the term afghanistan was officially used in 1855 when the british recognized dost mohammad khan as king of afghanistan history prehistory and antiquity excavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now afghanistan at least 50000 years ago and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world an important site of early historical activities many believe that afghanistan compares to egypt in terms of the historical value of its archaeological sites artifacts typical of the paleolithic mesolithic neolithic bronze and iron ages have been found in afghanistan urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 bce and the early city of mundigak near kandahar in the south of the country was a center of the helmand culture more recent findings established that the indus valley civilization stretched up towards modernday afghanistan an indus valley site has been found on the oxus river at shortugai in northern afghanistan there are several smaller ivc colonies to be found in afghanistan as well an indus valley site has been found on the oxus river at shortugai in northern afghanistan which shows afghanistan to have been a part of indus valley civilization after 2000 bce successive waves of seminomadic people from central asia began moving south into afghanistan among them were many indoeuropeanspeaking indoiranians these tribes later migrated further into south asia western asia and toward europe via the area north of the caspian sea the region at the time was referred to as ariana by the middle of the 6th century bce the achaemenids overthrew the medes and incorporated arachosia aria and bactria within its eastern boundaries an inscription on the tombstone of darius i of persia mentions the kabul valley in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered the region of arachosia around kandahar in modernday southern afghanistan used to be primarily zoroastrian and played a key role in the transfer of the avesta to persia and is thus considered by some to be the second homeland of zoroastrianism alexander the great and his macedonian forces arrived in afghanistan in 330 bce after defeating darius iii of persia a year earlier in the battle of gaugamela following alexanders brief occupation the successor state of the seleucid empire controlled the region until 305 bce when they gave much of it to the maurya empire as part of an alliance treaty the mauryans controlled the area south of the hindu kush until they were overthrown in about 185 bce their decline began 60 years after ashokas rule ended leading to the hellenistic reconquest by the grecobactrians much of it soon broke away and became part of the indogreek kingdom they were defeated and expelled by the indoscythians in the late 2nd century bce the silk road appeared during the first century bce and afghanistan flourished with trade with routes to china india persia and north to the cities of bukhara samarkand and khiva in presentday uzbekistan goods and ideas were exchanged at this center point such as chinese silk persian silver and roman gold while the region of present afghanistan was mining and trading lapis lazuli stones mainly from the badakhshan region during the first century bce the parthian empire subjugated the region but lost it to their indoparthian vassals in the midtolate first century ce the vast kushan empire centered in afghanistan became great patrons of buddhist culture making buddhism flourish throughout the region the kushans were overthrown by the sassanids in the 3rd century ce though the indosassanids continued to rule at least parts of the region they were followed by the kidarites who in turn was replaced by the hephthalites they were replaced by the turk shahi in the 7th century the buddhist turk shahi of kabul was replaced by a hindu dynasty before the saffarids conquered the area in 870 this hindu dynasty was called hindu shahi much of the northeastern and southern areas of the country remained dominated by buddhist culture medieval period arab muslims brought islam to herat and zaranj in 642 ce and began spreading eastward some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted before the arrival of islam the region used to be home to various beliefs and cults often resulting in syncretism between the dominant religions such as zoroastrianism buddhism or grecobuddhism ancient iranian religions hinduism christianity and judaism an exemplification of the syncretism in the region would be that people were patrons of buddhism but still worshipped local iranian gods such as ahura mazda lady nana anahita or mihr mithra and portrayed greek gods as protectors of buddha the zunbils and kabul shahi were first conquered in 870 ce by the saffarid muslims of zaranj later the samanids extended their islamic influence south of the hindu kush the ghaznavids rose to power in the 10th century by the 11th century mahmud of ghazni defeated the remaining hindu rulers and effectively islamized the wider region with the exception of kafiristan mahmud made ghazni into an important city and patronized intellectuals such as the historian albiruni and the poet ferdowsi the ghaznavid dynasty was overthrown by the ghurids in 1186 whose architectural achievements included the remote minaret of jam the ghurids controlled afghanistan for less than a century before being conquered by the khwarazmian dynasty in 1215 in 1219 ce genghis khan and his mongol army overran the region his troops are said to have annihilated the khwarazmian cities of herat and balkh as well as bamyan the destruction caused by the mongols forced many locals to return to an agrarian rural society mongol rule continued with the ilkhanate in the northwest while the khalji dynasty administered the afghan tribal areas south of the hindu kush until the invasion of timur aka tamerlane who established the timurid empire in 1370 under the rule of shah rukh the city of herat served as the focal point of the timurid renaissance whose glory matched florence of the italian renaissance as the center of a cultural rebirth in the early 16th century babur arrived from ferghana and captured kabul from the arghun dynasty babur would go on to conquer the afghan lodi dynasty who had ruled the delhi sultanate in the first battle of panipat between the 16th and 18th century the uzbek khanate of bukhara iranian safavids and indian mughals ruled parts of the territory during the medieval period the northwestern area of afghanistan was referred to by the regional name khorasan which was commonly used up to the 19th century among natives to describe their country hotak dynasty in 1709 mirwais hotak a local ghilzai tribal leader successfully rebelled against the safavids he defeated gurgin khan the georgian governor of kandahar under the safavids and established his own kingdom mirwais died in 1715 and was succeeded by his brother abdul aziz who was soon killed by mirwaiss son mahmud for possibly planning to sign a peace with the safavids mahmud led the afghan army in 1722 to the persian capital of isfahan and captured the city after the battle of gulnabad and proclaimed himself king of persia the afghan dynasty was ousted from persia by nader shah after the 1729 battle of damghan in 1738 nader shah and his forces captured kandahar in the siege of kandahar the last hotak stronghold from shah hussain hotak soon after the persian and afghan forces invaded india nader shah had plundered delhi alongside his 16yearold commander ahmad shah durrani who had assisted him on these campaigns nader shah was assassinated in 1747 durrani empire after the death of nader shah in 1747 ahmad shah durrani had returned to kandahar with a contingent of 4000 pashtuns the abdalis had unanimously accepted ahmad shah as their new leader with his ascension in 1747 ahmad shah had led multiple campaigns against the mughal empire maratha empire and thenreceding afsharid empire ahmad shah had captured kabul and peshawar from the mughal appointed governor nasir khan ahmad shah had then conquered herat in 1750 and had also captured kashmir in 1752 ahmad shah had launched two campaigns into khorasan 17501751 and 17541755 his first campaign had seen the siege of mashhad however he was forced to retreat after four months in november 1750 he moved to siege nishapur but he was unable to capture the city and was forced to retreat in early 1751 ahmad shah returned in 1754 he captured tun and on 23 july he sieged mashhad once again mashhad had fallen on 2 december but shahrokh was reappointed in 1755 he was forced to give up torshiz bakharz jam khaf and turbate haidari to the afghans as well as accept afghan sovereignty following this ahmad shah sieged nishapur once again and captured it ahmad shah invaded india eight times during his reign beginning in 1748 crossing the indus river his armies sacked and absorbed lahore into the durrani realm he met mughal armies at the battle of manupur 1748 where he was defeated and forced to retreat to back to afghanistan he returned the next year in 1749 and captured the area around lahore and punjab presenting it as an afghan victory for this campaign from 1749 to 1767 ahmad shah led six more invasions the most important being the last the third battle of panipat created a power vacuum in northern india halting maratha expansion ahmad shah durrani died in october 1772 and a civil war over succession followed with his named successor timur shah durrani succeeding him after the defeat of his brother suleiman mirza timur shah durrani ascended to the throne in november 1772 having defeated a coalition under shah wali khan and humayun mirza timur shah began his reign by consolidating power toward himself and people loyal to him purging durrani sardars and influential tribal leaders in kabul and kandahar one of timur shahs reforms was to move the capital of the durrani empire from kandahar to kabul timur shah fought multiple series of rebellions to consolidate the empire and he also led campaigns into punjab against the sikhs like his father though more successfully the most prominent example of his battles during this campaign was when he led his forces under zangi khan durrani  with over 18000 men total of afghan qizilbash and mongol cavalrymen  against over 60000 sikh men the sikhs lost over 30000 in this battle and staged a durrani resurgence in the punjab region the durranis lost multan in 1772 after ahmad shahs death following this victory by timur shah timur shah was able to lay siege to multan and recapture it incorporating it into the durrani empire once again reintegrating it as a province until the siege of multan 1818 timur shah was succeeded by his son zaman shah durrani after his death on in may 1793 timur shahs reign oversaw the attempted stabilization and consolidation of the empire however timur shah had over 24 sons which plunged the empire in civil war over succession crises zaman shah durrani succeeded to the durrani throne following the death of his father timur shah durrani his brothers mahmud shah durrani and humayun mirza revolted against him with humayun centered in kandahar and mahmud shah centered in herat zaman shah would defeat humayun and force the loyalty of mahmud shah durrani securing his position on the throne zaman shah led three campaigns into punjab the first two campaigns captured lahore but he retreated due to intel about a possible qajar invasion zaman shah embarked on his third campaign for punjab in 1800 to deal with a rebellious ranjit singh however he was forced to withdraw and zaman shahs reign was ended by mahmud shah durrani however just under two years in his reign mahmud shah durrani was deposed by his brother shah shuja durrani on 13 july 1803 shah shuja attempted to consolidate the durrani realm but was deposed by his brother at the battle of nimla 1809 mahmud shah durrani defeated shah shuja and forced him to flee usurping the throne again his second reign began on 3 may 1809 barakzai dynasty and british wars by the early 19th century the afghan empire was under threat from the persians in the west and the sikh empire in the east fateh khan leader of the barakzai tribe installed many of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire fateh khan was brutally murdered in 1818 by mahmud shah as a result the brothers of fateh khan and the barakzai tribe rebelled and a civil war brewed during this turbulent period afghanistan fractured into many states including the principality of qandahar emirate of herat khanate of qunduz maimana khanate and numerous other warring polities the most prominent state was the emirate of kabul ruled by dost mohammad khan with the collapse of the durrani empire and the exile of the sadozai dynasty to be left to rule in herat punjab and kashmir were lost to ranjit singh ruler of the sikh empire who invaded khyber pakhtunkhwa in march 1823 and captured the city of peshawar following the battle of nowshera in 1834 dost mohammad khan led numerous campaigns firstly campaigning to jalalabad and then allying with his rival brothers in kandahar to defeat shah shuja durrani and the british in the expedition of shuja ulmulk in 1837 dost mohammad khan attempted to conquer peshawar and sent a large force under his son wazir akbar khan leading to the battle of jamrud akbar khan and the afghan army failed to capture the jamrud fort from the sikh khalsa army but killed sikh commander hari singh nalwa thus ending the afghansikh wars by this time the british were advancing from the east capitalizing off of the decline of the sikh empire after it had its own period of turbulence following the death of ranjit singh which engaged the emirate of kabul in the first major conflict during the great game in 1839 a british expeditionary force marched into afghanistan invading the principality of qandahar and in august 1839 seized kabul dost mohammad khan defeated the british in the parwan campaign but surrendered following his victory he was replaced with the former durrani ruler shah shuja durrani as the new ruler of kabul a de facto puppet of the british following an uprising that saw the assassination of shah shuja the 1842 retreat from kabul of britishindian forces and the annihilation of elphinstones army and the punitive expedition of the battle of kabul that led to its sacking the british gave up on their attempts to try and subjugate afghanistan which allowed dost mohammad khan to return as ruler dost mohammad united most of the afghan realm in his reign launching numerous campaigns including against the surrounding states in afghanistan in numerous campaigns such as the hazarajat campaign conquest of balkh conquest of kunduz conquest of kandahar and finally securing the last major state herat in his final campaign during his campaigns of reunification he held friendly relations with the british and affirmed their status in the second angloafghan treaty of 1857 while bukhara and internal leaders pressured the afghans to invade india dost mohammad died in june 1863 a few weeks after his successful campaign to herat following his death a civil war ensued amongst his sons prominently mohammad afzal khan mohammad azam khan and sher ali khan sher ali won the resulting afghan civil war 18631869 and ruled the realm until 1878 when the british returned in the second angloafghan war to fight perceived russian influence in the region britain gained control of afghanistans foreign relations as part of the treaty of gandamak of 1879 making it an official british protected state in 1893 amir abdur rahman signed an agreement in which the ethnic pashtun and baloch territories were divided by the durand line which forms the modernday border between pakistan and afghanistan shiadominated hazarajat and pagan kafiristan remained politically independent until being conquered by abdur rahman khan in 18911896 he was known as the iron amir for his features and his ruthless methods against tribes he died in 1901 succeeded by his son habibullah khanhow can a small power like afghanistan which is like a goat between these lions and russia or a grain of wheat between two strong millstones of the grinding mill stand in the midway of the stones without being ground to dust during the first world war when afghanistan was neutral habibullah khan was met by officials of the central powers in the niedermayerhentig expedition they called on afghanistan to declare full independence from the united kingdom join them and attack british india as part of the hindugerman conspiracy the effort to bring afghanistan into the central powers failed but it sparked discontent among the population about maintaining neutrality with the british habibullah was assassinated in february 1919 and amanullah khan eventually assumed power a staunch supporter of the 19151916 expeditions amanullah khan provoked the third angloafghan war entering british india via the khyber pass after the end of the third angloafghan war and the signing of the treaty of rawalpindi on 19 august 1919 emir amanullah khan declared the emirate of afghanistan a sovereign and fully independent state he moved to end his countrys traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community particularly with the soviet union and

feeling and improving relations with the united kingdom afghanistan was neither a participant in world war ii nor aligned with either power bloc in the cold war however it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the soviet union and the united states vied for influence by building afghanistans main highways airports and other vital infrastructure on a per capita basis afghanistan received more soviet development aid than any other country in 1973 while the king was in italy daoud khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first president of afghanistan abolishing the

what is called the saur revolution the pdpa declared the establishment of the democratic republic of afghanistan with its first leader named as peoples democratic party general secretary nur muhammad taraki this would trigger a series of events that would dramatically turn afghanistan from a poor and secluded albeit peaceful country to a hotbed of international terrorism the pdpa initiated various social symbolic and land distribution reforms that provoked strong opposition while also brutally oppressing political dissidents this caused unrest and quickly expanded into a state of civil war by 1979 waged by guerrilla mujahideen and smaller maoist guerrillas against regime forces countrywide it quickly turned into a proxy war as the pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers the united states supported them through pakistans interservices intelligence isi and the soviet union sent thousands of military advisers to support the pdpa regime meanwhile there was increasingly hostile friction between the competing factions of the pdpa  the dominant khalq and the more moderate parcham in september 1979 pdpa general secretary taraki was assassinated in an internal coup orchestrated by thenprime minister hafizullah amin who became the new general secretary of the peoples democratic party the situation in the country deteriorated under amin and thousands of people went missing displeased with amins government the soviet army invaded the country in december 1979 heading for kabul and killing amin a sovietorganized regime led by parchams babrak karmal but inclusive of both factions parcham and khalq filled the vacuum soviet troops in more substantial numbers were deployed to stabilize afghanistan under karmal marking the beginning of the sovietafghan war lasting nine years the war caused the deaths of between 562000 and 2 million afghansoctober 2021 and displaced about 6 million people who subsequently fled afghanistan mainly to

trillion one official asserted that this will become the backbone of the afghan economy and a pentagon memo stated that afghanistan could become the saudi arabia of lithium the lithium reserves of 21 mio tons could amount to the ones of bolivia which is currently viewed as the country with the largest lithium reserves other larger deposits are the ones of bauxite and cobalt access to biocapacity in afghanistan is lower than world average in 2016 afghanistan had 043 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory much less than the world average of 16 global hectares per person in 2016 afghanistan used 073 global hectares of biocapacity per persontheir ecological footprint of consumption this means they use just under double as much biocapacity as afghanistan contains as a result afghanistan is running a biocapacity deficit infrastructure energy according to the world bank 98 of the rural population have access to electricity in 2018 up from 28 in 2008 overall the figure stands at 987 as of 2016 afghanistan produces 1400 megawatts of power but still imports the majority of electricity via transmission lines from iran and the central asian states the majority of electricity production is via hydropower helped by the amount of rivers and streams that flow from the mountains however electricity is not always reliable and blackouts happen including in kabul in recent years an increasing number of solar biomass and wind power plants have been constructed currently under development are the casa1000 project which will transmit electricity from kyrgyzstan and

and various border crossings while skirting around the mountains of the hindu kush the ring road is crucially important for domestic and international trade and the economy a key portion of the ring road is the salang tunnel completed in 1964 which facilitates travel through the hindu kush mountain range and connects northern and southern afghanistan it is the only land route that connects central asia to the indian subcontinent several mountain passes allow travel between the hindu kush in other areas serious traffic accidents are common on afghan roads and highways particularly on the

greece to the south spanning an area of 28748 it displays a varied range of climatic geological hydrological and morphological conditions the countrys landscapes range from rugged snowcapped mountains in the albanian alps and the korab skanderbeg pindus and ceraunian mountains to fertile lowland plains extending from the coasts of the adriatic and ionian seas tirana is the capital and largest city in the country followed by durrës vlorë and shkodër in ancient times the illyrians inhabited northern and central regions of albania whilst epirotes inhabited the south several important ancient greek colonies were also established on the coast the illyrian kingdom centered in what is now albania was the dominant power before the rise of macedon in the 2nd century bce the region was annexed by the roman republic and after the division of the roman empire it became part of byzantium the first known albanian autonomous principality  arbanon  was established in the 12th century the kingdom of albania principality of albania and albania veneta were formed between the 13th and 15th centuries in different parts of the country alongside other albanian principalities and political entities in the late 15th century albania became part of the ottoman empire until 1912 when the modern albanian state declared independence in 1939 italy invaded the kingdom of albania which became greater albania and then a protectorate of nazi germany during world war ii following the war the peoples socialist republic of albania was formed which lasted until the revolutions of 1991 concluded with the fall of communism in albania and eventually the establishment of the current republic of albania since its independence in 1912 albania has undergone a diverse political evolution transitioning from a monarchy to a communist regime before becoming a sovereign parliamentary constitutional republic governed by a constitution prioritising the separation of powers the countrys political structure includes a parliament a ceremonial president a functional prime minister and a hierarchy of courts albania is a developing country with an uppermiddle income economy driven by the service sector with manufacturing and tourism also playing significant roles the country underwent a transition post the dissolution of communism shifting from a centralised planning to adopting an open market economy citizens in albania benefit from universal health care access and receive complimentary primary and secondary education name the historical origins of the term albania can be traced back to medieval latin with its foundations believed to be associated with the illyrian tribe of the albani this connection gains further support from the work of the ancient greek geographer ptolemy during the 2nd century ad where he included the settlement of albanopolis situated to the northeast of durrës the presence of a medieval settlement named albanon or arbanon hints at the possibility of historical continuity however the precise relationship between these historical references and the question of whether albanopolis was synonymous with albanon remains a subject of scholarly debate the byzantine historian michael attaliates in his 11th century historical account provides the earliest undisputed reference to the albanians when he mentions them having taken part in a revolt against constantinople in 1079 additionally he identified the arbanitai as subjects under the governance of the duke of dyrrachium in the middle ages albania was denoted as arbëri or arbëni by its inhabitants who identified themselves as arbëreshë or arbëneshë albanians employ the terms shqipëri or shqipëria when referring to their nation designations that trace their historical origins to the 14th century however it was not until the late 17th and early 18th centuries that these terms gradually superseded arbëria and arbëreshë among the albanians these two expressions are widely interpreted to symbolise children of the eagles and land of the eagles history prehistory mesolithic habitation in albania has been evidenced in several open air sites which during that period were close to the adriatic coastline and in cave sites mesolithic objects found in a cave near xarrë include flint and jasper objects along with fossilised animal bones while those discoveries at mount dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the aurignacian culture the neolithic era in albania began around 7000 bce and is evidenced in finds which indicate domestication of sheep and goats and smallscale agriculture a part of the neolithic population may have been the same as the mesolithic population of the southern balkans like in the konispol cave where the mesolithic stratum coexists with prepottery neolithic finds cardium pottery culture appears in coastal albania and across the adriatic after 6500 bce while the settlements of the interior took part in the processes which formed starčevo culture the albanian bitumen mines of selenicë provide early evidence of bitumen exploitation in europe dating to late neolithic albania from 5000 bce when local communities used it as pigment for ceramic decoration waterproofing and adhesive for reparing broken vessels the bitumen of selenicë circulated towards eastern albania from the early 5th millennium bce first evidence of its overseas trade export comes from neolithic and bronze age southern italy the high quality bitumen of selenicë has been exploited throughout all the historical ages since the late neolithic era until today the indoeuropeanization of albania in the context of the ieization of the western balkans began after 2800 bce the presence of the early bronze age tumuli in the vicinity of later apollonia dates to 2679174 calbce 28522505 calbce these burial mounds belong to the southern expression of the adriaticljubljana culture related to later cetina culture which moved southwards along the adriatic from the northern balkans the same community built similar mounds in montenegro rakića kuće and northern albania shtoj the first archaeogenetic find related to the ieization of albania involves a man with predominantly yamnaya ancestry buried in a tumulus of northeastern albania which dates to 26632472 calbce during the middle bronze age cetina culture sites and finds appear in albania cetina culture moved southwards across the adriatic from the cetina valley of dalmatia in albania cetina finds are concentrated around southern lake shkodër and appear typically in tumulus cemeteries like in shkrel and shtoj and hillforts like gajtan shkodër as well as cave sites like blaz nezir and keputa central albania and lake basin sites like sovjan southeastern albania antiquity the incorporated territory of albania was historically inhabited by indoeuropean peoples amongst them numerous illyrian and epirote tribes there were also several greek colonies the territory referred to as illyria corresponded roughly to the area east of the adriatic sea in the mediterranean sea extending in the south to the mouth of the vjosë the first account of the illyrian groups comes from periplus of the euxine sea a greek text written in the 4th century bc the bryges were also present in central albania while the south was inhabited by the epirote chaonians whose capital was at phoenice other colonies such as apollonia and epidamnos were established by greek citystates on the coast by the 7th century bc the illyrian taulanti were a powerful illyrian tribe that were among the earliest recorded tribes in the area they lived in an area that corresponds much of presentday albania together with the dardanian ruler cleitus glaucias the ruler of the taulantian kingdom fought against alexander the great at the battle of pelium in 335 bc as the time passed the ruler of ancient macedonia cassander of macedon captured apollonia and crossed the river genusus shkumbin in 314 bc a few years later glaucias laid siege to apollonia and captured the greek colony of epidamnos the illyrian ardiaei tribe centred in montenegro ruled over most of the territory of northern albania their ardiaean kingdom reached its greatest extent under king agron the son of pleuratus ii agron extended his rule over other neighbouring tribes as well following agrons death in 230 bc his wife teuta inherited the ardiaean kingdom teutas forces extended their operations further southwards to the ionian sea in 229 bc rome declared war on the kingdom for extensively plundering roman ships the war ended in illyrian defeat in 227 bc teuta was eventually succeeded by gentius in 181 bc gentius clashed with the romans in 168 bc initiating the third illyrian war the conflict resulted in roman conquest of the region by 167 bc the romans split the region into three administrative divisions middle ages the roman empire was split in 395 upon the death of theodosius i into an eastern and western roman empire in part because of the increasing pressure from threats during the barbarian invasions from the 6th century into the 7th century the slavs crossed the danube and largely absorbed the indigenous greeks illyrians and thracians in the balkans thus the illyrians were mentioned for the last time in historical records in the 7th century in the 11th century the great schism formalised the break of communion between the eastern orthodox and western catholic church that is reflected in albania through the emergence of a catholic north and orthodox south the albanian people inhabited the west of lake ochrida and the upper valley of river shkumbin and established the principality of arbanon in 1190 under the leadership of progon of kruja the realm was succeeded by his sons gjin and dhimitri upon the death of dhimiter the territory came under the rule of the albaniangreek gregory kamonas and subsequently under the golem of kruja in the 13th century the principality was dissolved arbanon is considered to be the first sketch of an albanian state that retained a semiautonomous status as the western extremity of the byzantine empire under the byzantine doukai of epirus or laskarids of nicaea towards the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th centuries serbs and venetians started to take possession over the territory the ethnogenesis of the albanians is uncertain however the first undisputed mention of albanians dates back in historical records from 1079 or 1080 in a work by michael attaliates who referred to the albanoi as having taken part in a revolt against constantinople at this point the albanians were fully christianised after the dissolution of arbanon charles of anjou concluded an agreement with the albanian rulers promising to protect them and their ancient liberties in 1272 he established the kingdom of albania and conquered regions back from the despotate of epirus the kingdom claimed all of central albania territory from dyrrhachium along the adriatic sea coast down to butrint a catholic political structure was a basis for the papal plans of spreading catholicism in the balkan peninsula this plan found also the support of helen of anjou a cousin of charles of anjou around 30 catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule mainly in northern albania internal power struggles within the byzantine empire in the 14th century enabled serbs most powerful medieval ruler stefan dusan to establish a shortlived empire that included all of albania except durrës in 1367 various albanian rulers established the despotate of arta during that time several albanian principalities were created notably the principality of albania principality of kastrioti lordship of berat and principality of dukagjini in the first half of the 15th century the ottoman empire invaded most of albania and the league of lezhë was held under skanderbeg as a ruler who became the national hero of the albanian medieval history ottoman empire with the fall of constantinople the ottoman empire continued an extended period of conquest and expansion with its borders going deep into southeast europe they reached the albanian ionian sea coast in 1385 and erected their garrisons across southern albania in 1415 and then occupied most of albania in 1431 thousands of albanians consequently fled to western europe particularly to calabria naples ragusa and sicily whereby others sought protection at the often inaccessible mountains of albania the albanians as christians were considered an inferior class of people and as such they were subjected to heavy taxes among others by the devshirme system that allowed the sultan to collect a requisite percentage of christian adolescents from their families to compose the janissary the ottoman conquest was also accompanied with the gradual process of islamisation and the rapid construction of mosques a prosperous and longstanding revolution erupted after the formation of the league of lezhë until the fall of shkodër under the leadership of gjergj kastrioti skanderbeg who consistently defeated major ottoman armies led by sultans murad ii and mehmed ii skanderbeg managed to unite several of the albanian principalities amongst them the arianitis dukagjinis zaharias and thopias and establish a centralised authority over most of the nonconquered territories becoming the lord of albania the ottoman empires expansion ground to a halt during the time that skanderbegs forces resisted and he has been credited with being one of the main reasons for the delay of ottoman expansion into western europe giving the italian principalities more time to better prepare for the ottoman arrival however the failure of most european nations with the exception of naples in giving him support along with the failure of pope pius iis plans to organize a promised crusade against the ottomans meant that none of skanderbegs victories permanently hindered the ottomans from invading the western balkans despite his brilliance as a military leader skanderbegs victories were only delaying the final conquests the constant ottoman invasions caused enormous destruction to albania greatly reducing the population and destroying flocks of livestock and crops besides surrender there was no possible way skanderbeg would be able to halt the ottoman invasions despite his successes against them his manpower and resources were insufficient preventing him from expanding the war efforts and driving the turks from the albanian borders albania was therefore doomed to face an unending series of ottoman attacks until it eventually fell years after his death when the ottomans were gaining a firm foothold in the region albanian towns were organised into four principal sanjaks the government fostered trade by settling a sizeable jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in spain the city of vlorë saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from europe such as velvets cotton goods mohairs carpets spices and leather from bursa and constantinople some citizens of vlorë even had business associates throughout europe the phenomenon of islamisation among the albanians became primarily widespread from the 17th century and continued into the 18th century islam offered them equal opportunities and advancement within the ottoman empire however motives for conversion were according to some scholars diverse depending on the context though the lack of source material does not help when investigating such issues because of increasing suppression of catholicism most catholic albanians converted in the 17th century while orthodox albanians followed suit mainly in the following century since the albanians were seen as strategically important they made up a significant proportion of the ottoman military and bureaucracy many muslim albanians attained important political and military positions and culturally contributed to the broader muslim world enjoying this privileged position they held various high administrative positions with over two dozen albanian grand viziers others included members of the prominent köprülü family zagan pasha muhammad ali of egypt and ali pasha of tepelena furthermore two sultans bayezid ii and mehmed iii both had mothers of albanian origin rilindja the albanian renaissance was a period with its roots in the late 18th century and continuing into the 19th century during which the albanian people gathered spiritual and intellectual strength for an independent cultural and political life within an independent nation modern albanian culture flourished too especially albanian literature and arts and was frequently linked to the influences of the romanticism and enlightenment principles prior to the rise of nationalism ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of national unity or conscience by the albanian people the victory of russia over the ottoman empire following the russianottoman wars resulted the execution of the treaty of san stefano which overlooked to assign albanianpopulated lands to the slavic and greek neighbours however the united kingdom and austrohungarian empire consequently blocked the arrangement and caused the treaty of berlin from this point albanians started to organise themselves with the goal to protect and unite the albanianpopulated lands into a unitary nation leading to the formation of the league of prizren the league had initially the assistance of the ottoman authorities whose position was based on the religious solidarity of muslim people and landlords connected with the ottoman administration they favoured and protected the muslim solidarity and called for defence of muslim lands simultaneously constituting the reason for titling the league committee of the real muslims approximately 300 muslims participated in the assembly composed by delegates from bosnia the administrator of the sanjak of prizren as representatives of the central authorities and no delegates from vilayet of scutari signed by only 47 muslim deputies the league issued the kararname that contained a proclamation that the people from northern albania epirus and bosnia and herzegovina are willing to defend the territorial integrity of the ottoman empire by all possible means against the troops of bulgaria serbia and montenegro ottomans authorities cancelled their assistance when the league under abdyl frashëri became focused on working towards albanian autonomy and requested merging four vilayets including kosovo shkodër monastir and ioannina into an unified vilayet the albanian vilayet the league used military force to prevent the annexing areas of plav and gusinje assigned to montenegro after several successful battles with montenegrin troops such as the battle of novšiće the league was forced to retreat from their contested regions the league was later defeated by the ottoman army sent by the sultan independence albania declared independence from the ottoman empire on 28 november 1912 accompanied with the establishment of the senate and government by the assembly of vlorë on 4 december 1912 its sovereignty was recognised by the conference of london on 29 july 1913 the treaty of london delineated the borders of the country and its neighbours leaving many albanians outside albania predominantly partitioned between montenegro serbia and greece headquartered in vlorë the international commission of control was established on 15 october 1913 to take care of the administration of newly established albania until its own political institutions were in order the international gendarmerie was established as the first law enforcement agency of the principality of albania in november the first gendarmerie members arrived in the country prince of albania wilhelm of wied princ vilhelm vidi was selected as the first prince of the principality on 7 march he arrived in the provisional capital of durrës and started to organise his government appointing turhan pasha përmeti to form the first albanian cabinet in november 1913 the albanian proottoman forces had offered the throne of albania to the ottoman war minister of albanian origin ahmed izzet pasha the proottoman peasants believed that the new regime was a tool of the six christian great powers and local landowners that owned half of the arable land in february 1914 the autonomous republic of northern epirus was proclaimed in gjirokastër by the local greek population against incorporation to albania this initiative was shortlived and in 1921 the southern provinces were incorporated into the albanian principality meanwhile the revolt of albanian peasants against the new albanian regime erupted under the leadership of the group of muslim clerics gathered around essad pasha toptani who proclaimed himself the saviour of albania and islam in order to gain support of the mirdita catholic volunteers from the northern part of albania prince wied appointed their leader prênk bibë doda to be the foreign minister of the principality of albania in may and june 1914 the international gendarmerie was joined by isa boletini and his men mostly from kosovo and northern mirdita catholics were defeated by the rebels who captured most of central albania by the end of august 1914 the regime of prince wied collapsed and he left the country on 3 september 1914 first republic the interwar period in albania was marked by persistent economic and social difficulties political instability and foreign interventions after world war i albania lacked an established government and internationally recognised borders rendering it vulnerable to neighboring entities such as greece italy and yugoslavia all of which sought to expand their influence this led to political uncertainty highlighted in 1918 when the congress of durrës sought paris peace conference protection but was denied further complicating albanias position on the international stage territorial tensions escalated as yugoslavia particularly serbia sought control of northern albania while greece aimed dominance in southern albania the situation deteriorated in 1919 when the serbs launched attacks on albanian inhabitants among others in gusinje and plav resulting in massacres and largescale displacement meanwhile italian influence continued to expand during this time driven by economic interests and political ambitions fan noli renowned for his idealism assumed the role of prime minister in the year of 1924 with a vision to institute a westernstyle constitutional government abolish feudalism counter italian influence and enhance critical sectors including infrastructure education and healthcare he faced resistance from former allies who had assisted in the removal of zog from power and struggled to secure the foreign aid to implement his agenda nolis decision to establish diplomatic ties with the soviet union an adversary of the serbian elite ignited allegations of bolshevism from belgrade this in turn led to increased pressure from italy and culminated in zogs restoration to authority subsequently in 1928 zogu transitioned albania from a republic to a monarchy that garnered backing from fascist italy with zog assuming the title of king zog i key constitutional changes dissolved the senate and established a unicameral national assembly while preserving zogs authoritative powers in 1939 italy led by benito mussolini launched a military invasion of albania resulting to the exile of zog and the creation of an italian protectorate as world war ii progressed italy aimed to expand its territorial dominion in the balkans including territorial claims on regions of greece chameria macedonia montenegro and kosovo these ambitions laid the foundation of greater albania which aimed to unite all areas with albanianmajority populations into a single country in 1943 as italys control declined nazi germany assumed control of albania subjecting albanians to forced labor economic exploitation and repression under german rule the tide shifted in 1944 when the albanian partisan forces under the leadership of enver hoxha and other communist leaders successfully liberated albania from german occupation communism the establishment of the peoples republic of albania with the leadership of enver hoxha characterised a significant epoch in the modern history of albania hoxhas regime embraced marxismleninism ideologies and implemented authoritarian policies including the prohibition of religious practices severe restrictions on travel and the abolition of private property rights it was also defined by a persistent pattern of purges extensive repression instances of betrayal and a hostility towards external influences any form of opposition or resistance to his rule was met with expeditious and severe consequences such as internal exile extended imprisonment and execution the regime confronted a multitude of challenges in albania that encompassed widespread poverty illiteracy health crises and gender inequality as a response hoxha initiated a modernisation initiative aimed at attaining economic and social liberation and transforming the country into an industrial society the regime placed a high priority on the diversification of the economy through a programme of sovietstyle industrialisation comprehensive infrastructure development such as the introduction of a transformative railway system expansion of education and healthcare services elimination of adult illiteracy and targeted advancements in areas such as womens rights the diplomatic history of albania during the communism was characterised by notable diplomatic conflicts initially aligned with yugoslavia as a satellite state the relationship deteriorated as yugoslavia aimed to incorporate albania within its territory subsequently albania established relations with the soviet union and engaged trade agreements with other eastern european countries but experienced disagreements over soviet policies leading to strained ties with moscow and a diplomatic separation in 1961 simultaneously tensions with the west also heightened due to albanias refusal to hold free elections and allegations of western support for anticommunist uprisings albanias enduring partnership was with china as it sided with beijing during the sinosoviet conflict resulting in severed ties with the soviet union and withdrawal from the warsaw pact in response to the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 however their relations stagnated in the 1970 prompting both sides to reassess their commitment and albania actively reduced its dependence on china under hoxhas regime albania underwent a widespread campaign targeting religious clergy of various faiths resulting in public persecution and executions particularly targeting muslims roman catholics and eastern orthodox adherents in 1946 religious estates underwent nationalisation coinciding with the closure or transformation of religious institutions into various other purposes the culmination occurred in 1976 when albania attained the status of being the worlds first constitutional atheist state under this regime albanians were forced to renounce their religious beliefs adopt a secular way of life and embrace a socialist ideology fourth republic after four decades of communism paired with the revolutions of 1989 albania witnessed a notable rise in political activism particularly among the students which ultimately lead to a transformation in the prevailing order subsequent to the attainment of widespread in the first multiparty elections of 1991 the communist party maintained a stronghold in the parliament until their defeat in the parliamentary elections of 1992 directed by the democratic party considerable economic and financial resources were devoted to pyramid schemes that were widely supported by the government the schemes swept up somewhere between one sixth and one third of the population of the country despite the warnings of the international monetary fund sali berisha defended the schemes as large investment firms leading more people to redirect their remittances and sell their homes and cattle for cash to deposit in the schemes the schemes began to collapse in late 1996 leading many of the investors to join initially peaceful protests against the government requesting their money back the protests turned violent in february 1997 as government forces responded by firing on the demonstrators in march the police and republican guard deserted leaving their armouries open these were promptly emptied by militias and criminal gangs the resulting civil war caused a wave of evacuations of foreign nationals and refugees the crisis led both aleksandër meksi and sali berisha to resign from office in the wake of the general election in april 1997 operation alba a un peacekeeping force led by italy entered the country with two goals exclusively to assist with the evacuation of expatriates and to secure the ground for international organisations

forecast that the population will continue shrinking for the next decade at least depending on the actual birth rate and the level of net migration in 2022 over 46000 people migrated out of albania a 10 increase over the previous year the explanation for the recent population decrease is the fall of communism in albania in the late twentieth century that period was marked by economic mass

convention for the protection of national minorities stated that the results of the census should be viewed with the utmost caution and calls on the authorities not to rely exclusively on the data on nationality collected during the census in determining its policy on the protection of national minorities regarding the greeks estimates vary between 60000 and 300000 ethnic greeks in albania according to ian jeffries most western sources put the number at around 200000 the 300000 mark is supported by greek government as well the cia world factbook estimates the greek minority to

italian is stable in every age group while there is a decrease of the speakers of greek in the youngest group among young people aged 25 or less english german and turkish have seen rising interest after 2000 italian and french have had a stable interest while greek has lost much of its previous interest the trends are linked with cultural and economic factors young people have shown a growing interest in the german language in recent yearsjune 2023 some of them go to germany for studying or various experiences albania and germany have agreements for cooperating in helping young people of

meshari the missal written by gjon buzuku was published in 1555 and is considered one of the first literary work of written albanian during the middle ages the refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written albanian a tradition that is not well understood however there is some fragmented evidence predating buzuku which indicates that albanian was written from at least the 14th century albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only but historical chronicles too they are mentioned by the humanist marin barleti who in his book siege of shkodër rrethimi i shkodrës from 1504 confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people in vernacula lingua as well as his

of god allah ˈ allāh ar is the common arabic word for god in the english language the word generally refers to god in islam the word is thought to be derived by contraction from alilāh which means the god and is linguistically related to the aramaic words elah and syriac ܐܠܗܐ ʼalāhā and the hebrew word el elohim for god the word allah has been used by arabic people of different religions since preislamic times the preislamic arabs worshipped a supreme deity whom they called allah alongside other lesser deities muhammad used the word allah to indicate the islamic conception of god allah has been used as a term for god by muslims both arab and nonarab judaeoarabicspeaking jews and arab christians after the terms alilāh and allah were used interchangeably in classical arabic by the majority of arabs who had become muslims it is also often albeit not exclusively used in this way by bábists baháʼís mandaeans indonesian and maltese christians and sephardi jews as well as by the gagauz people similar usage by christians and sikhs in peninsular malaysia has recently led to political and legal controversies etymology the etymology of the word allāh has been discussed extensively by classical arab philologists grammarians of the basra school regarded it as either formed spontaneously murtajal or as the definite form of lāh from the verbal root lyh with the meaning of lofty or hidden others held that it was borrowed from syriac or hebrew most considered it to be derived from a contraction of the arabic definite article al and ar deity god to ar meaning the deity the god indeed there is the interchangeability of alilāh and allāh in early arabic poetry even when composed by the christian ʿadī ibn zayd the majority of modern scholars subscribe to the latter theory and view the loanword hypothesis with skepticism the use of allah as the name of a deity appears as early as the first century an inscription using the ancient south arabian script in old arabic from qaryat alfāw reads to kahl and lh and ʿaththar bkhl wlh wʿṯr cognates of the name allāh exist in other semitic languages including hebrew and aramaic the corresponding aramaic form is ʼelāh אלה but its emphatic state is arc אלהא it is written as ܐܠܗܐ arc in biblical aramaic and ܐܠܗܐ syc in syriac both meaning simply god the unusual syriac form is likely an imitation of the arabic history of usage preislamic arabians regional variants of the word allah occur in both pagan and christian preislamic inscriptions different theories have been proposed regarding the role of allah in preislamic polytheistic cults according to the islamic scholar ibn kathir arab pagans considered allah as an unseen god who created and controlled the universe pagans believed worship of humans or animals who had lucky events in their life brought them closer to god preislamic meccans worshiped allah alongside a host of lesser gods and those whom they called the daughters of allah islam forbade worship of anyone or anything other than god some authors have suggested that polytheistic arabs used the name as a reference to a creator god or a supreme deity of their pantheon the term may have been vague in the meccan religion according to one hypothesis which goes back to julius wellhausen allah the supreme deity of the tribal federation around quraysh was a designation that consecrated the superiority of hubal the supreme deity of quraysh over the other gods however there is also evidence that allah and hubal were two distinct deities according to that hypothesis the kaaba was first consecrated to a supreme deity named allah and then hosted the pantheon of quraysh after their conquest of mecca about a century before the time of muhammad some inscriptions seem to indicate the use of allah as a name of a polytheist deity centuries earlier but nothing precise is known about this use some scholars have suggested that allah may have represented a remote creator god who was gradually eclipsed by more particularized local deities there is disagreement on whether allah played a major role in the meccan religious cult no iconic representation of allah is known to have existed allah is the only god in mecca that did not have an idol muhammads fathers name was ar meaning the slave of allāh the interpretation that preislamic arabs once practiced abrahamic religions is supported by some literary evidence being the prevalence of ishmael whose god was that of abraham in preislamic arab culture islam before muhammad in islam it is believed that all prophets were adherents of islam which is considered the primordial faith since the creation of the world and heavens by allah according to this perspective every human is born a muslim into a state of fitra natural disposition often interpreted as an innate inclination towards islam present day in islam allah is the unique omnipotent and only deity and creator of the universe and is equivalent to god in other abrahamic religions allah is usually seen as the personal name of god a notion which became disputed in contemporary scholarship including the question whether or not the word allah should be translated as god according to islamic belief allah is the most common word to represent god and humble submission to his will divine ordinances and commandments is the pivot of the muslim faith he is the only god creator of the universe and the judge of humankind he is unique ar and inherently one ar allmerciful and omnipotent no human eyes can see allah till the day of judgement the quran declares the reality of allah his inaccessible mystery his various names and his actions on behalf of his creatures allah does not depend on anything god is not a part of the christian trinity god has no parents and no children the concept correlates to the tawhid where chapter 112 of the quran alikhlās the sincerity reads allah there is no deity but him the alive the eternal neither slumber nor sleep overtaketh him unto him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth who could intercede in his presence without his permission he knoweth that which is in front of them and that which is behind them while they encompass nothing of his knowledge except what he wills his throne includeth the heavens and the earth and he is never weary of preserving them he is the sublime the tremendous in islamic tradition there are 99 names of god ar lit meaning the best names or the most beautiful names each of which evoke a distinct characteristic of allah all these names refer to allah the supreme and allcomprehensive divine name among the 99 names of god the most famous and most frequent of these names are the merciful arraḥmān and the compassionate ar including the forementioned above alaḥad the one the indivisible and alwāḥid the unique the single most muslims use the untranslated arabic phrase ar meaning if god wills after references to future events muslim discursive piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of ar meaning in the name of god there are certain phrases in praise of god that are favored by muslims including ar glory be to god ar praise be to god ar there is no deity but god or sometimes lā ilāha illā inta huwa there is no deity but you him and ar god is the most great as a devotional exercise of remembering god dhikr in a sufi practice known as dhikr allah arabic ذكر الله lit remembrance of god the sufi repeats and contemplates the name allah or other associated divine names to him while controlling his or her breath for example in countless references in the context from the quran forementioned above according to gerhard böwering in contrast with preislamic arabian polytheism god in islam does not have associates and companions nor is there any kinship between god and jinn preislamic pagan arabs believed in a blind powerful inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control this was replaced with the islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful god according to francis edward peters the qurān insists muslims believe and historians affirm that muhammad and his followers worship the same god as the jews 29 the qurans allah is the same creator god who covenanted with abraham peters states that the quran portrays allah as both more powerful and more remote than yahweh and as a universal deity unlike yahweh who closely follows israelites christianity the christian arabs of today have no other word for god than allah similarly the aramaic word for god in the language of assyrian christians is ʼĕlāhā or alaha even the arabicdescended maltese language of malta whose population is almost entirely catholic uses alla for god arab christians have used two forms of invocations that were affixed to the beginning of their written works they adopted the muslim ar and also created their own trinitized ar as early as the 8th century the muslim ar reads in the name of god the compassionate the merciful the trinitized ar reads in the name of father and the son and the holy spirit one god the syriac latin and greek invocations do not have the words one god at the end this addition was made to emphasize the monotheistic aspect of trinitarian belief and also to make it more palatable to muslims according to marshall hodgson it seems that in the preislamic times some arab christians made pilgrimage to the kaaba a pagan temple at that time honoring allah there as god the creator some archaeological excavation quests have led to the discovery of ancient preislamic inscriptions and tombs made by arab christians in the ruins of a church at umm eljimal in northern jordan which initially according to enno littman 1949 contained references to allah as the proper name of god however on a second revision by bellamy et al 1985  1988 the 5versedinscription was retranslated as 1this inscription was set up by colleagues of ʿulayh 2 son of ʿubaydah secretary 3 of the cohort augusta secunda 4 philadelphiana may he go mad who 5 effaces it the syriac word ܐܠܗܐ ʼĕlāhā can be found in the reports and the lists of names of christian martyrs in south arabia as reported by antique syriac documents of the names of those martyrs from the era of the himyarite and aksumite kingdoms in ibn ishaqs biography there is a christian leader named abd allah ibn abu bakr ibn muhammad who was martyred in najran in 523 as he had worn a ring that said allah is my lord in an inscription of christian martyrion dated back to 512 references to lilah الاله can be found in both arabic and aramaic the inscription starts with the statement by the help of lilah in preislamic gospels the name used for god was allah as evidenced by some discovered arabic versions of the new testament written by arab christians during the preislamic era in northern and southern arabia however most recent research in the field of islamic studies by sydney griffith et al 2013 david d grafton 2014 clair wilde 2014  ml hjälm et al 2016  2017 assert that all one can say about the possibility of a preislamic christian version of the gospel in arabic is that no sure sign of its actual existence has yet emerged additionally ml hjälm in her most recent research 2017 inserts that manuscripts containing translations of the gospels are encountered no earlier than the year 873 irfan shahîd quoting the 10thcentury encyclopedic collection kitab alaghani notes that preislamic arab christians have been reported to have raised the battle cry ya la ibad allah o slaves of allah to invoke each other into battle according to shahid on the authority of 10thcentury muslim scholar almarzubani allah was also mentioned in preislamic christian poems by some ghassanid and tanukhid poets in syria and northern arabia pronunciation the word allāh is generally pronounced ɑɫˈɫɑːh exhibiting a heavy lām ɫ a velarized alveolar lateral approximant a marginal phoneme in modern standard arabic since the initial alef has no hamza the initial a is elided when a preceding word ends in a vowel if the preceding vowel is i the lām is light l as in for instance the basmala as a loanword english and other european languages the history of the name allāh in english was probably influenced by the study of comparative religion in the 19th century for example thomas carlyle 1840 sometimes used the term allah but without any implication that allah was anything different from god however in his biography of muḥammad 1934 tor andræ always used the term allah though he allows that this conception of god seems to imply that it is different from that of the jewish and christian theologies languages which may not commonly use the term allah to denote god may still contain popular expressions which use the word for example because of the centuries long muslim presence in the iberian peninsula the word ojalá in the spanish language and oxalá in the portuguese language exist today borrowed from andalusi arabic xaa similar to ar إن شاء ٱلله this phrase literally means if god wills in the sense of i hope so the german poet mahlmann used the form allah as the title of a poem about the ultimate deity though it is unclear how much islamic thought he intended to convey some muslims leave the name allāh untranslated in english rather than using the english translation god the word has also been applied to certain living human beings as personifications of the term and concept malaysian and indonesian language christians in malaysia and indonesia use allah to refer to god in the malaysian and indonesian languages both of them standardized forms of the malay language mainstream bible translations in the language use allah as the translation of hebrew hbo translated in english bibles as god this goes back to early translation work by francis xavier in the 16th century the first dictionary of dutchmalay by albert cornelius ruyl justus heurnius and caspar wiltens in 1650 revised edition from 1623 edition and 1631 latin edition recorded allah as the translation of the dutch word godt ruyl also translated the gospel of matthew in 1612 into the malay language an early bible translation into a noneuropean language made a year after the publication of the king james version which was printed in the netherlands in 1629 then he translated the gospel of mark published in 1638 the government of malaysia in 2007 outlawed usage of the term allah in any other but muslim contexts but the malayan high court in 2009 revoked the law ruling it unconstitutional while allah had been used for the christian god in malay for more than four centuries the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of allah by the roman catholic newspaper the herald the government appealed the court ruling and the high court suspended implementation of its verdict until the hearing of the appeal in october 2013 the court ruled in favor of the governments ban in early 2014 the malaysian government confiscated more than 300 bibles for using the word to refer to the christian god in peninsular malaysia however the use of allah is not prohibited in the two malaysian states of sabah and sarawak the main reason it is not prohibited in these two states is that usage has been longestablished and local alkitab bibles have been widely distributed freely in east malaysia without restrictions for years both states also do not have similar islamic state laws as those in west malaysia in reaction to some media criticism the malaysian government has introduced a 10point solution to avoid confusion and misleading information the 10point solution is in line with the spirit of the 18 and 20point agreements of sarawak and sabah national flags with allah written on them typography the word ar is always written without an ar to spell the ar vowel this is because the spelling was settled before arabic spelling started habitually using ar to spell ar however in vocalized spelling a small diacritic ar is added on top of the ar to indicate the pronunciation in the preislamic zabad inscription god is referred to by the term الاله that is aliflamaliflamha this presumably indicates alilāh  the god without alif for ā many arabic type fonts feature special ligatures for allah since arabic script is used to write other texts rather than koran only rendering ar  ar  ar as the previous ligature is considered faulty which is the case with most common arabic typefaces unicode unicode has a code point reserved for ar ﷲ  ufdf2 in the arabic presentation formsa block which exists solely for compatibility with some older legacy character sets that encoded presentation forms directly this is discouraged for new text instead the word ar should be represented by its individual arabic letters while modern font technologies will render the desired ligature the calligraphic variant of the word used as the emblem of iran is encoded in unicode in the miscellaneous symbols range at code point u262b  the flags that include the word are also present in the regional indicator symbols of unicode      see also notes references general and cited references further

northwest armenia and turkey to the west and iran to the south baku is the capital and largest city the territory of what is now azerbaijan was first ruled by caucasian albania and later various persian empires until the 19th century it remained part of qajar iran but the russopersian wars of 18041813 and 18261828 forced the qajar empire to cede its caucasian territories to the russian empire the treaties of gulistan in 1813 and turkmenchay in 1828 defined the border between russia and qajar iran the region north of the aras was part of iran until it was conquered by russia in the 19th century where it was administered as part of the caucasus viceroyalty by the late 19th century an azerbaijani national identity emerged with the azerbaijan democratic republic proclaimed its independence from the transcaucasian democratic federative republic in 1918 a year after the russian empire collapsed and became the first secular democratic muslimmajority state in 1920 the country was incorporated into the soviet union as the azerbaijan ssr the modern republic of azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on 30 august 1991 shortly before the dissolution of the soviet union in the same year in september 1991 the ethnic armenian majority of the nagornokarabakh region formed the selfproclaimed republic of artsakh which became de facto independent with the end of the first nagornokarabakh war in 1994 although the region and seven surrounding districts remained internationally recognized as part of azerbaijan following the second nagornokarabakh war in 2020 the seven districts and parts of nagornokarabakh were returned to azerbaijani control an azerbaijani offensive in 2023 ended the republic of artsakh and resulted in the flight of nagornokarabakh armenians

new azerbaijan party in power since 1993 has been accused of authoritarianism under president heydar aliyev and his son ilham aliyev and deteriorating the countrys human rights record including increasing restrictions on civil liberties particularly on press freedom and political repression etymology according to a modern etymology the term azerbaijan derives from that of atropates a persian satrap under the achaemenid empire who was later reinstated as the satrap of media under alexander the great the original etymology of this name is thought to have its roots in the oncedominant zoroastrianism in the avestas frawardin yasht hymn to the guardian angels there is a mention of âterepâtahe ashaonô fravashîm ýazamaide which literally translates from avestan as we worship the fravashi of the holy atropatene the name atropates itself is the greek transliteration of an old iranian probably median compounded name with the meaning protected by the holy fire or the land of the holy fire the greek name was mentioned by diodorus siculus and strabo over the span of millennia the name evolved to pal middle persian then to fa fa fa new persian and presentday azerbaijan the name azerbaijan was first adopted for the area of the presentday republic of azerbaijan by the government of musavat in 1918 after the collapse of the russian empire when the independent azerbaijan democratic republic was established until then the designation had been used exclusively to identify the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern iran while the area of the azerbaijan democratic republic was formerly referred to as arran and shirvan on that basis iran protested the newly adopted country name during soviet rule the country was also spelled in latin from the russian transliteration as ru азербайджан the countrys name was also spelled in cyrillic script from 1940 to 1991 as азәрбајҹан history antiquity the earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of azerbaijan dates back to the late stone age and is related to the guruchay culture of azykh cave early settlements included the scythians during the 9th century bc following the scythians iranian medes came to dominate the area to the south of the aras river the medes forged a vast empire between 900 and 700 bc which was integrated into the achaemenid empire around 550 bc the area was conquered by the achaemenids leading to the spread of zoroastrianism from the sasanid period to the safavid period the sasanian empire turned caucasian albania into a vassal state in 252 while king urnayr officially adopted christianity as the state religion in the 4th century despite sassanid rule albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century while fully subordinate to sassanid iran and retained its monarchy despite being one of the chief vassals of the sasanian emperor the albanian king had only a semblance of authority and the sasanian marzban military governor held most civil religious and military authority in the first half of the 7th century caucasian albania as a vassal of the sasanians came under nominal muslim rule due to the muslim conquest of persia the umayyad caliphate repulsed both the sasanians and byzantines from the south caucasus and turned caucasian albania into a vassal state after christian resistance led by king javanshir was suppressed in 667 the power vacuum left by the decline of the abbasid caliphate was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the sallarids sajids and shaddadids at the beginning of the 11th century the territory was gradually seized by the waves of oghuz turks from central asia who adopted a turkoman ethnonym at the time the first of these turkic dynasties established was the seljuk empire which entered the area now known as azerbaijan by 1067 the preturkic population that lived on the territory of modern azerbaijan spoke several indoeuropean and caucasian languages among them armenian and an iranian language old azeri which was gradually replaced by a turkic language the early precursor of the azerbaijani language of today some linguists have also stated that the tati dialects of iranian azerbaijan and the republic of azerbaijan like those spoken by the tats are descended from old azeri locally the possessions of the subsequent seljuk empire were ruled by eldiguzids technically vassals of the seljuk sultans but sometimes de facto rulers themselves under the seljuks local poets such as nizami ganjavi and khaqani gave rise to a blossoming of persian literature on the territory of presentday azerbaijan the local dynasty of the shirvanshahs became a vassal state of timurs empire and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the golden horde tokhtamysh following timurs death two independent and rival states emerged qara qoyunlu and aq qoyunlu the shirvanshahs returned maintaining for numerous centuries to come a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals as they had done since 861 in 1501 the safavid dynasty of iran subdued the shirvanshahs and gained its possessions in the course of the next century the safavids converted the formerly sunni population to shia islam as they did with the population in what is modernday iran the safavids allowed the shirvanshahs to remain in power under safavid suzerainty until 1538 when safavid king tahmasp i r 15241576 completely deposed them and made the area into the safavid province of shirvan the sunni ottomans briefly managed to occupy presentday azerbaijan as a result of the ottomansafavid war of 15781590 by the early 17th century they were ousted by safavid iranian ruler abbas i r 15881629 in the wake of the demise of the safavid empire baku and its environs were briefly occupied by the russians as a consequence of the russopersian war of 17221723 remainder of present azerbaijan was occupied by the ottomans from 1722 to 1736 despite brief intermissions such as these by safavid irans neighboring rivals the land of what is today azerbaijan remained under iranian rule from the earliest advent of the safavids up to the course of the 19th century modern history after the safavids the area was ruled by the iranian afsharid dynasty after the death of nader shah r 17361747 many of his former subjects capitalized on the eruption of instability numerous selfruling khanates with various forms of autonomy emerged in the area the rulers of these khanates were directly related to the ruling dynasties of iran and were vassals and subjects of the iranian shah the khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between central asia and the west thereafter the area was under the successive rule of the iranian zands and qajars from the late 18th century imperial russia switched to a more aggressive geopolitical stance towards its two neighbors and rivals to the south namely iran and the ottoman empire russia now actively tried to gain possession of the caucasus region which was for the most part in the hands of iran in 1804 the russians invaded and sacked the iranian town of ganja sparking the russopersian war of 18041813 the militarily superior russians ended the russopersian war of 18041813 with a victory following qajar irans loss in the 18041813 war it was forced to concede suzerainty over most of the khanates along with georgia and dagestan to the russian empire per the treaty of gulistan the area to the north of the river aras amongst which territory lies the contemporary republic of azerbaijan was iranian territory until russia occupied it in the 19th century about a decade later in violation of the gulistan treaty the russians invaded irans erivan khanate this sparked the final bout of hostilities between the two the russopersian war of 18261828 the resulting treaty of turkmenchay forced qajar iran to cede sovereignty over the erivan khanate the nakhchivan khanate and the remainder of the talysh khanate comprising the last parts of the soil of the contemporary azerbaijani republic that were still in iranian hands after the incorporation of all caucasian territories from iran into russia the new border between the two was set at the aras river which upon the soviet unions disintegration subsequently became part of the border between iran and the azerbaijan republic qajar iran was forced to cede its caucasian territories to russia in the 19th century which thus included the territory of the modernday azerbaijan republic while as a result of that cession the azerbaijani ethnic group is nowadays parted between two nations iran and azerbaijan despite the russian conquest throughout the entire 19th century preoccupation with iranian culture literature and language remained widespread amongst shia and sunni intellectuals in the russianheld cities of baku ganja and tiflis tbilisi now georgia within the same century in postiranian russianheld east caucasia an azerbaijani national identity emerged at the end of the 19th century after the collapse of the russian empire during world war i the shortlived transcaucasian democratic federative republic was declared constituting the presentday republics of azerbaijan georgia and armenia it was followed by the march days massacres that took place between 30 march and 2 april 1918 in the city of baku and adjacent areas of the baku governorate of the russian empire when the republic dissolved in may 1918 the leading musavat party declared independence as the azerbaijan democratic republic adr adopting the name of azerbaijan for the new republic a name that prior to the proclamation of the adr was solely used to refer to the adjacent northwestern region of contemporary iran the adr was the first modern parliamentary republic in the muslim world among the important accomplishments of the parliament was the extension of suffrage to women making azerbaijan the first muslim nation to grant women equal political rights with men another important accomplishment of adr was the establishment of baku state university which was the first moderntype university founded in the muslim east by march 1920 it was obvious that soviet russia would attack baku vladimir lenin said that the invasion was justified as soviet russia could not survive without bakus oil independent azerbaijan lasted only 23 months until the bolshevik 11th soviet red army invaded it establishing the azerbaijan ssr on 28 april 1920 although the bulk of the newly formed azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an armenian revolt that had just broken out in karabakh azerbaijanis did not surrender their brief independence of 191820 quickly or easily as many as 20000 azerbaijani soldiers died resisting what was effectively a russian reconquest within the ensuing early soviet period the azerbaijani national identity was finally forged on 13 october 1921 the soviet republics of russia armenia azerbaijan and georgia signed an agreement with turkey known as the treaty of kars the previously independent republic of aras would also become the nakhchivan autonomous soviet socialist republic within the azerbaijan ssr by the treaty of kars on the other hand armenia was awarded the region of zangezur and turkey agreed to return gyumri then known as alexandropol during world war ii azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of the soviet union with 80 percent of the soviet unions oil on the eastern front being supplied by baku by the decree of the supreme soviet of the ussr in february 1942 the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the oil industry of azerbaijan were awarded orders and medals operation edelweiss carried out by the german wehrmacht targeted baku because of its importance as the energy petroleum dynamo of the ussr a fifth of all azerbaijanis fought in the second world war from 1941 to 1945 approximately 681000 people with over 100000 of them women went to the front while the total population of azerbaijan was 34 million at the time some 250000 people from azerbaijan were killed on the front more than 130 azerbaijanis were named heroes of the soviet union azerbaijani majorgeneral azi aslanov was twice awarded the hero of the soviet union independence following the politics of glasnost initiated by mikhail gorbachev civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the soviet union including nagornokarabakh an autonomous region of the azerbaijan ssr the disturbances in azerbaijan in response to moscows indifference to an already heated conflict resulted in calls for independence and secession which culminated in the black january events in baku later in 1990 the supreme council of the azerbaijan ssr dropped the words soviet socialist from the title adopted the declaration of sovereignty of the azerbaijan republic and restored the flag of the azerbaijan democratic republic as the state flag as a consequence of the failed 1991 soviet coup détat attempt in moscow the supreme council of azerbaijan adopted a declaration of independence on 18 october 1991 which was affirmed by a nationwide referendum in december 1991 while the soviet union officially ceased to exist on 26 december 1991 the country now celebrates its independence day on 18 october the early years of independence were overshadowed by the first nagornokarabakh war with the ethnic armenian majority of nagornokarabakh backed by armenia by the end of the hostilities in 1994 armenians controlled up to 1416 percent of azerbaijani territory including nagornokarabakh

the contest entering with x my heart by singer aisel there are dozens of azerbaijani folk dances they are performed at formal celebrations and the dancers wear national clothes like the chokha which is wellpreserved within the national dances most dances have a very fast rhythm literature among the medieval authors born within the territorial limits of modern azerbaijani republic was persian poet and philosopher nizami called ganjavi after his place of birth ganja who was the author of the khamsa the quintuplet composed of five romantic poems including the treasure of mysteries khosrow and shīrīn and leyli and mejnūn the earliest known figure in written azerbaijani literature was izzeddin hasanoghlu who composed a divan consisting of persian and azerbaijani ghazals in persian ghazals he used his penname while his azerbaijani ghazals were composed under his own name of hasanoghlu classical literature in azerbaijani was formed in the 14th century based on the various early middle ages dialects of tabriz and shirvan among the poets of this period were gazi burhanaddin haqiqi penname of jahan shah qara qoyunlu and habibi the end of the 14th century was also the period of starting literary activity of imadaddin nasimi one of the greatest azerbaijani hurufi mystical poets of the late 14th and early 15th centuries and one of the most prominent early divan masters in turkic literary history who also composed poetry in persian and arabic the divan and ghazal styles were further developed by poets qaseme anvar fuzuli and khatai penname of safavid shah ismail i the book of dede korkut consists of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century and was not written earlier than the 15th century it is a collection of 12 stories reflecting the oral tradition of oghuz nomads the 16thcentury poet muhammed fuzuli produced his timeless philosophical and lyrical qazals in arabic persian and azerbaijani benefiting immensely from the fine literary traditions of his environment and building upon the legacy of his predecessors fuzuli was destined to become the leading literary figure of his society his major works include the divan of ghazals and the qasidas in the same century azerbaijani literature further flourished with the development of ashik aşıq poetic genre of bards during the same period under the penname of khatāī خطائی for sinner shah ismail i wrote about 1400 verses in azerbaijani which were later published as his divan a unique literary style known as qoshma qoşma for improvisation was introduced in this period and developed by shah ismail and later by his son and successor shah tahmasp i in the span of the 17th and 18th centuries fuzulis unique genres as well ashik poetry were taken up by prominent poets and writers such as qovsi of tabriz shah abbas sani agha mesih shirvani nishat molla vali vidadi molla panah vagif amani zafar and others along with turks turkmens and uzbeks azerbaijanis also celebrate the epic of koroglu from kor oğlu for blind mans son a legendary folk hero several documented versions of koroglu epic remain at the institute for manuscripts of the national academy of sciences of azerbaijan modern azerbaijani literature in azerbaijan is based on the shirvani dialect mainly while in iran it is based on the tabrizi one the first newspaper in azerbaijani akinchi was published in 1875 in the mid19th century it was taught in the schools of baku ganja shaki tbilisi and yerevan since 1845 it was also taught in the university of saint petersburg in russiaoctober 2020 folk art azerbaijanis have a rich and distinctive culture a major part of which is decorative and applied art this art form is represented by a wide range of handicrafts such as chasing jeweling engraving in metal carving in wood stone bone carpetmaking lasing pattern weaving and printing and knitting and embroidery each of these types of decorative art evidence of the endowments of the azerbaijan nation is very much in favor here many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants travelers and diplomats who had visited these places at different times the azerbaijani carpet is a traditional handmade textile of various sizes with a dense texture and a pile or pileless surface whose patterns are characteristic of azerbaijans many carpetmaking regions in november 2010 the azerbaijani carpet was proclaimed a masterpiece of intangible heritage by unesco azerbaijan has been since ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts the archeological dig on the territory of azerbaijan testifies to the welldeveloped agriculture stock raising metalworking pottery ceramics and carpetweaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium bc archeological sites in dashbulaq hasansu zayamchai and tovuzchai uncovered from the btc pipeline have revealed early iron age artifacts azerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups scientific research of the azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of latif karimov a prominent scientist and artist it was his classification that related the four large groups of carpets with the four geographical zones of azerbaijan gubashirvan ganjakazakh karabakh and tabriz cuisine the traditional cuisine is famous for an abundance of vegetables and greens used seasonally in the dishes fresh herbs including mint cilantro coriander dill basil parsley tarragon leeks chives thyme marjoram green onion and watercress are very popular and often accompany main dishes on the table climatic diversity and fertility of the land are reflected in the national dishes which are based on fish from the caspian sea local meat mainly mutton and beef and an abundance of seasonal vegetables and greens saffronrice plov is the flagship food in azerbaijan and black tea is the national beverage azerbaijanis often use traditional armudu pearshaped glass as they have very strong tea culture popular traditional dishes include bozbash lamb soup that exists in several regional varieties with the addition of different vegetables qutab fried turnover with a filling of greens or minced meat and dushbara sort of dumplings of dough filled with ground meat and flavor architecture azerbaijani architecture typically combines elements of east and west azerbaijani architecture has heavy influences from persian architecture many ancient architectural treasures such as the maiden tower and palace of the shirvanshahs in the walled city of baku survive in modern azerbaijan entries submitted on the unesco world heritage tentative list include the ateshgah of baku momine khatun mausoleum hirkan national park binagadi asphalt lake lökbatan mud volcano shusha state historical and architectural reserve baku stage mountain caspian shore defensive constructions ordubad national reserve and the palace of shaki khans among other architectural treasures are quadrangular castle in mardakan parigala in yukhary chardaglar a number of bridges spanning the aras river and several mausoleums in the 19th and early 20th centuries little monumental architecture was created but distinctive residences were built in baku and elsewhere among the most recent architectural monuments the baku subways are noted for their lavish decor the task for modern azerbaijani architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics the search for an architects own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historicocultural environment major projects such as heydar aliyev cultural center flame towers baku crystal hall baku white city and socar tower have transformed the countrys skyline and promotes its contemporary identity visual art the gamigaya petroglyphs which date back to the 1st to 4th millennium bc are located in azerbaijans ordubad district they consist of some 1500 dislodged and carved rock paintings with images of deer goats bulls dogs snakes birds fantastic beings and people carriages and various symbols were found on basalt rocks norwegian ethnographer and adventurer thor heyerdahl was convinced that people from the area went to scandinavia in about 100 ad took their boat building skills with them and transmuted them into the viking boats in northern europe over the centuries azerbaijani art has gone through many stylistic changes azerbaijani painting is traditionally characterized by a warmth of colour and light as exemplified in the works of azim azimzade and bahruz kangarli and a preoccupation with religious figures and cultural motifs azerbaijani painting enjoyed preeminence in caucasus for hundreds of years from the romanesque and ottoman periods and through the soviet and baroque periods the latter two of which saw fruition in azerbaijan other notable artists who fall within these periods include sattar bahlulzade togrul narimanbekov tahir salahov alakbar rezaguliyev mirza gadim iravani mikayil abdullayev and boyukagha mirzazade cinema the film industry in azerbaijan dates back to 1898 azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in cinematography with the apparatus first showing up in baku in 1919 during the azerbaijan democratic republic a documentary the celebration of the anniversary of azerbaijani independence was filmed on the first anniversary of azerbaijans independence from russia 27 may and premiered in june 1919 at several theatres in baku after the soviet power was established in 1920 nariman narimanov chairman of the revolutionary committee of azerbaijan signed a decree nationalizing azerbaijans cinema this also influenced the creation of azerbaijani animation in 1991 after azerbaijan gained its independence from the soviet union the first baku international film festival eastwest was held in baku in december 2000 the former president of azerbaijan heydar aliyev signed a decree proclaiming 2 august to be the professional holiday of filmmakers of azerbaijan today azerbaijani filmmakers are again dealing with issues similar to those faced by cinematographers prior to the establishment of the soviet union in 1920 once again both choices of content and sponsorship of films are largely left up to the initiative of the filmmaker television there are three stateowned television channels aztv idman tv and medeniyyet tv there is one public channel and 6 private channels i̇ctimai television space tv lider tv azad azerbaijan tv xazar tv real tv azerbaijan  real tv and arb human rights the constitution of azerbaijan claims to guarantee freedom of speech but this is denied in practice after several years of decline in press and media freedom in 2014 the media environment in azerbaijan deteriorated rapidly under a governmental campaign to silence any opposition and criticism even while the country led the committee of ministers of the council of europe maynovember 2014 spurious legal charges and impunity in violence against journalists have remained the norm all foreign broadcasts are banned in the country according to the 2013 freedom house freedom of the press report azerbaijans press freedom status is not free and azerbaijan ranks 177th out of 196 countries christianity is officially recognized all religious communities are required to register to be allowed to meet under the risk of imprisonment this registration is often denied racial discrimination contributes to the countrys lack of religious freedom since many of the christians are ethnic armenian or russian rather than azeri muslim radio free europeradio liberty and voice of america are banned in azerbaijan discrimination against lgbt people in azerbaijan is widespread during the last few yearsdecember 2017 three journalists were killed and several prosecuted in trials described as unfair by international human rights organizations azerbaijan had the biggest number of journalists imprisoned in europe in 2015 according to the committee to protect journalists and is the 5th most censored country in the world ahead of iran and china some critical journalists have been arrested for their coverage of the covid19 pandemic in azerbaijan a report by an amnesty international researcher in october 2015 points to the severe deterioration of human rights in azerbaijan over the past few years sadly azerbaijan has been allowed to get away with unprecedented levels of repression and in the process almost wipe out its civil society amnestys 201516 annual report on the country stated  persecution of political dissent continued human rights organizations remained unable to resume their work at least 18 prisoners of conscience remained in detention at the end of the year reprisals against independent journalists and activists persisted both in the country and abroad while their family members also faced harassment and arrests international human rights monitors were barred and expelled from the country reports of torture and other illtreatment persisted the guardian reported in april 2017 that azerbaijans ruling elite operated a secret 29bn 22bn scheme to pay prominent europeans buy luxury goods and launder money through a network of opaque british companies  leaked data shows that the azerbaijani leadership accused of serial human rights abuses systemic corruption and rigging elections made more than 16000 covert payments from 2012 to 2014 some of this money went to politicians and journalists as part of an international lobbying operation to deflect criticism of azerbaijans president ilham aliyev and to promote a positive image of his oilrich country there was no suggestion that all recipients were aware of the source of the money as it arrived via a disguised route sport freestyle wrestling has been traditionally regarded as azerbaijans national sport in which azerbaijan won up to fourteen medals including four golds since joining the international olympic committee currently the most popular sports include football and wrestling football is the most popular sport in azerbaijan and the association of football federations of azerbaijan with 9122 registered players is the largest sporting association in the country the national football team of azerbaijan demonstrates relatively low performance in the international arena compared to the nation football clubs the most successful azerbaijani football clubs are neftçi qarabağ and gabala in 2012 neftchi baku became the first azerbaijani team to advance to the group stage of a european competition beating apoel of cyprus 42 on aggregate in the playoff round of the 201213 uefa europa league in 2014 qarabağ became the second azerbaijani club advancing to the group stage of uefa europa league in 2017 after beating copenhagen 22 a in the playoff round of the uefa champions league qarabağ became the first azerbaijani club to reach the group stage futsal is another popular sport in azerbaijan the azerbaijan national futsal team reached fourth place in the 2010 uefa futsal championship while domestic club araz naxçivan clinched bronze medals at the 200910 uefa futsal cup and 201314 uefa futsal cup azerbaijan was the main sponsor of spanish football club atlético de madrid during seasons 20132014 and 20142015 a partnership that the club described should promote the image of azerbaijan in the world azerbaijan is one of the traditional powerhouses of world chess having hosted many international chess tournaments and competitions and became european team chess championship winners in 2009 2013 and 2017 notable chess players from the countrys chess schools that have made a great impact on the game include teimour radjabov shahriyar mammadyarov vladimir makogonov vugar gashimov and former world chess champion garry kasparov 2014 countrys home of shamkir chess a category 22 event and one of the highest rated tournaments of all time backgammon also plays a major role in azerbaijani culture the game is very popular in azerbaijan and is widely played among the local public there are also different variations of backgammon developed and analyzed by azerbaijani experts azerbaijan womens volleyball super league is one of the strongest women leagues in the world its womens national team came fourth at the 2005 european championship over the last years clubs like

tourism amateur astronomy categories amateur astronomers amateur astronomy articles containing video clips citizen science amateur astronomy is a hobby where participants enjoy observing or imaging celestial objects in the sky using the unaided eye binoculars or telescopes even though scientific research may not be their primary goal some amateur astronomers make contributions in doing citizen science such as by monitoring variable stars double stars sunspots or occultations of stars by the moon or asteroids or by discovering transient astronomical events such as comets galactic novae or supernovae in other galaxies amateur astronomers do not use the field of astronomy as their primary source of income or support and usually have no professional degree in astrophysics or advanced academic training in the subject most amateurs are hobbyists while others have a high degree of experience in astronomy and may often assist and work alongside professional astronomers many astronomers have studied the sky throughout history in an amateur framework however since the beginning of the twentieth century professional astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from amateur astronomy and associated activities amateur astronomers typically view the sky at night when most celestial objects and astronomical events are visible but others observe during the daytime by viewing the sun and solar eclipses some just look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes or binoculars but more dedicated amateurs often use portable telescopes or telescopes situated in their private or club observatories amateurs also join amateur astronomical societies which can advise educate or guide them towards ways of finding and observing celestial objects they also promote the science of astronomy among the general public objectives collectively amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena common targets of amateur astronomers include the sun the moon planets stars comets meteor showers and a variety of deep sky objects such as star clusters galaxies and nebulae many amateurs like to specialise in observing particular objects types of objects or types of events which interest them one branch of amateur astronomy amateur astrophotography involves the taking of photos of the night sky astrophotography has become more popular with the introduction of far easier to use equipment including digital cameras dslr cameras and relatively sophisticated purpose built high quality ccd cameras and cmos cameras most amateur astronomers work at visible wavelengths but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum an early pioneer of radio astronomy was grote reber an amateur astronomer who constructed the first purpose built radio telescope in the late 1930s to follow up on the discovery of radio wavelength emissions from space by karl jansky nonvisual amateur astronomy includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes and also the use of radio telescopes some amateur astronomers use homemade radio telescopes while others use radio telescopes that were originally built for astronomical research but have since been made available for use by amateurs the onemile telescope is one such example common tools amateur astronomers use a range of instruments to study the sky depending on a combination of their interests and resources methods include simply looking at the night sky with the naked eye using binoculars and using a variety of optical telescopes of varying power and quality as well as additional sophisticated equipment such as cameras to study light from the sky in both the visual and nonvisual parts of the spectrum to further improve studying the visual and nonvisual part of the spectrum amateur astronomers go to rural areas to get away from light pollution commercial telescopes are available new and used but it is also common for amateur astronomers to build or commission the building of their own custom telescopes some people even focus on amateur telescope making as their primary interest within the hobby of amateur astronomy although specialized and experienced amateur astronomers tend to acquire more specialized and more powerful equipment over time relatively simple equipment is often preferred for certain tasks binoculars for instance although generally of lower power than the majority of telescopes also tend to provide a wider field of view which is preferable for looking at some objects in the night sky recent models of iphones have introduced a night mode option when taking pictures as well that allows you to increase exposure which is a period of time the picture is being taken for this optimizes focus on light in the frame which is why it is used primarily at night amateur astronomers also use star charts that depending on experience and intentions may range from simple planispheres through to detailed charts of very specific areas of the night sky a range of astronomy software is available and used by amateur astronomers including software that generates maps of the sky software to assist with astrophotography observation scheduling software and software to perform various calculations pertaining to astronomical phenomena amateur astronomers often like to keep records of their observations which usually takes the form of an observing log observing logs typically record details about which objects were observed and when as well as describing the details that were seen sketching is sometimes used within logs and photographic records of observations have also been used in recent times the information gathered is used to help studies and interactions between amateur astronomers in yearly gatherings although not professional information or credible it is a way for the hobby lovers to share their new sightings and experiences the popularity of imaging among amateurs has led to large numbers of web sites being written by individuals about their images and equipment much of the social interaction of amateur astronomy occurs on mailing lists or discussion groups discussion group servers host numerous astronomy lists a great deal of the commerce of amateur astronomy the buying and selling of equipment occurs online many amateurs use online tools to plan their nightly observing sessions using tools such as the clear sky chart common techniques while a number of interesting celestial objects are readily identified by the naked eye sometimes with the aid of a star chart many others are so faint or inconspicuous that technical means are necessary to locate them although many methods are used in amateur astronomy most are variations of a few specific techniquesseptember 2017 star hopping star hopping is a method often used by amateur astronomers with lowtech equipment such as binoculars or a manually driven telescope it involves the use of maps or memory to locate known landmark stars and hopping between them often with the aid of a finderscope because of its simplicity star hopping is a very common method for finding objects that are close to nakedeye stars more advanced methods of locating objects in the sky include telescope mounts with setting circles which assist with pointing telescopes to positions in the sky that are known to contain objects of interest and goto telescopes which are fully automated telescopes that are capable of locating objects on demand having first been calibrated mobile apps the advent of mobile applications for use in smartphones has led to the creation of many dedicated apps these apps allow any user to easily locate celestial objects of interest by simply pointing the smartphone device in that direction in the sky these apps make use of the inbuilt hardware in the phone such as gps location and gyroscope useful information about the pointed object like celestial coordinates the name of the object its constellation etc are provided for a quick reference some paid versions give more information these apps are gradually getting into regular use during observing for the alignment process of telescopes setting circles setting circles are angular measurement scales that can be placed on the two main rotation axes of some telescopesseptember 2017 since the widespread adoption of digital setting circles any classical engraved setting circle is now specifically identified as an analog setting circle asc by knowing the coordinates of an object usually given in equatorial coordinates the telescope user can use the setting circle to align ie point the telescope in the appropriate direction before looking through its eyepiece a computerized setting circle is called a digital setting circle dsc although digital setting circles can be used to display a telescopes ra and dec coordinates they are not simply a digital readout of what can be seen on the telescopes analog setting circles as with goto telescopes digital setting circle computers commercial names include argo navis sky commander and ngc max contain databases of tens of thousands of celestial objects and projections of planet positions to find a celestial object in a telescope equipped with a dsc computer one does not need to look up the specific ra and dec coordinates in a book or other resource and then adjust the telescope to those numerical readings rather the object is chosen from the electronic database which causes distance values and arrow markers to appear in the display that indicate the distance and direction to move the telescope the telescope is moved until the two angular distance values reach zero indicating that the telescope is properly aligned when both the ra and dec axes are thus zeroed out the object should be in the eyepiece many dscs like goto systems can also work in conjunction with laptop sky programsnovember 2018 computerized systems provide the further advantage of computing coordinate precession traditional printed sources are subtitled by the epoch year which refers to the positions of celestial objects at a given time to the nearest year eg j2005 j2007 most such printed sources have been updated for intervals of only about every fifty years eg j1900 j1950 j2000 computerized sources on the other hand are able to calculate the right ascension and declination of the epoch of date to the exact instant of observation goto telescopes goto telescopes have become more popular since the 1980s as technology has improved and prices have been reduced with these computerdriven telescopes the user typically enters the name of the item of interest and the mechanics of the telescope point the telescope towards that item automatically they have several notable advantages for amateur astronomers intent on research for example goto telescopes tend to be faster for locating items of interest than star hopping allowing more time for studying of the object goto also allows manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler altazimuth telescope mounts allowing them to produce an overall less expensive product goto telescopes usually have to be calibrated using alignment stars in order to provide accurate tracking and positioning however several telescope manufacturers have recently developed telescope systems that are calibrated with the use of builtin gps decreasing the time it takes to set up a telescope at the start of an observing session remotecontrolled telescope remotecontrolled telescopes with the development of fast internet in the last part of the 20th century along with advances in computer controlled telescope mounts and ccd cameras remote telescope astronomy is now a viable means for amateur astronomers not aligned with major telescope facilities to partake in research and deep sky imaging this enables anyone to control a telescope a great distance away in a dark location the observer can image through the telescope using ccd cameras the digital data collected by the telescope is then transmitted and displayed to the user by means of the internet an example of a digital remote telescope operation for public use via the internet is the bareket observatory and there are telescope farms in new mexico australia and atacama in chile imaging techniques amateur astronomers engage in many imaging techniques including film dslr lrgb and ccd astrophotography because ccd imagers are linear image processing may be used to subtract away the effects of light pollution which has increased the popularity of astrophotography in urban areas narrowband filters may also be used to minimize light pollution scientific research scientific research is most often not the main goal for many amateur astronomers unlike professional astronomers work of scientific merit is possible however and many amateurs successfully contribute to the knowledge base of professional astronomers astronomy is sometimes promoted as one of the few remaining sciences for which amateurs can still contribute useful data to recognize this the astronomical society of the pacific annually gives amateur achievement awards for significant contributions to astronomy by amateurs the majority of scientific contributions by amateur astronomers are in the area of data collection in particular this applies where large numbers of amateur astronomers with small telescopes are more effective than the relatively small number of large telescopes that are available to professional astronomers several organizations such as the american association of variable star observers and the british astronomical association exist to help coordinate these contributions amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of variable stars and supernovae helping to track asteroids and observing occultations to determine both the shape of asteroids and the shape of the terrain on the apparent edge of the moon as seen from earth with more advanced equipment but still cheap in comparison to professional setups amateur astronomers can measure the light spectrum emitted from astronomical objects which can yield highquality scientific data if the measurements are performed with due care a relatively recent role for amateur astronomers is searching for overlooked phenomena eg kreutz sungrazers in the vast libraries of digital images and other data captured by earth and space based observatories much of which is available over the internet in the past and present amateur astronomers have played a major role in discovering new comets recently however funding of projects such as the lincoln nearearth asteroid research and near earth asteroid tracking projects has meant that most comets are now discovered by automated systems long before it is possible for amateurs to see them societies there are a large number of amateur astronomical societies around the world that serve as a meeting point for those interested in amateur astronomy members range from active observers with their own equipment to armchair astronomers who are simply interested in the topic societies range widely in their goals and activities which may depend on a variety of factors such as geographic spread local circumstances size and membership for example a small local society located in dark countryside may focus on practical observing and star parties whereas a large one based in a major city might have numerous members but be limited by light pollution and thus hold regular indoor meetings with guest speakers instead major national or international societies generally publish their own journal or newsletter and some hold large multiday meetings akin to a scientific conference or convention they may also have sections devoted to particular topics such as lunar observation or amateur telescope making notable amateur astronomers discoveries with major contributions by amateur astronomers prizes recognizing amateur astronomers see also references further reading external links aikido categories aikido japanese martial arts dō articles containing video clips aikido shinjitai 合気道 kyūjitai 合氣道 ja aikiꜜdoː is a modern japanese martial art that is split into many different styles including iwama ryu iwama shin shin aiki shuren kai shodokan aikido yoshinkan renshinkai aikikai and ki aikido aikido is now practiced in around 140 countries it was originally developed by morihei ueshiba as a synthesis of his martial studies philosophy and religious beliefs ueshibas goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attackers from injury aikido is often translated as the way of unifying with life energy or as the way of harmonious spirit according to the founders philosophy the primary goal in the practice of aikido is to overcome oneself instead of cultivating violence or aggressiveness morihei ueshiba used the phrase true victory final victory over oneself here and now to refer to this principle aikidos fundamental principles include ja entering ja ja breathing control ja triangular principle and ja turning movements that redirect the opponents attack momentum its curriculum comprises various techniques primarily throws and joint locks it also includes a weapons system encompassing the ja ja and ja aikido derives mainly from the martial art of daitōryū aikijūjutsu but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s partly due to ueshibas involvement with the ōmotokyō religion ueshibas early students documents bear the term ja ueshibas senior students have different approaches to aikido depending partly on when they studied with him today aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis however they all share techniques formulated by ueshiba and most have concern for the wellbeing of the attacker etymology and basic philosophy the word aikido is formed of three kanji the term ja does not readily appear in the japanese language outside the scope of budō this has led to many possible interpretations of the word 合 ja is mainly used in compounds to mean combine unite join together meet examples being 合同 combinedunited 合成 composition 結合 unitecombinejoin together 連合 unionallianceassociation 統合 combineunify and 合意 mutual agreement there is an idea of reciprocity 知り合う to get to know one another 話し合い talkdiscussionnegotiation and 待ち合わせる meet by appointment 気 ja is often used to describe a feeling or emotive action as in x気がする i feel x as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning and 気持ち feelingsensation it is used to mean energy or force as in 電気 electricity and 磁気 magnetism it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things as in 気質 spirittraittemperament the characters aeteological history can be traced back to the much older chinese character of zh zh that is used extensively in traditional chinese medicine and acupuncture the term ja in aikido is found in many other japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo and in various nonmartial arts such as japanese calligraphy ja flower arranging ja and tea ceremony ja or ja therefore from a purely literal interpretation aikido is the way of combining forces or way of unifying energy in which the term ja refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attackers movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort one applies ja by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a countertechnique history aikido was created by morihei ueshiba 18831969 referred to by some aikido practitioners as ja great teacher the term aikido was coined in the 20th century ueshiba envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of his martial training but as an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation during ueshibas lifetime and continuing today aikido has evolved from the ja that ueshiba studied into a variety of expressions by martial artists throughout the world initial development ueshiba developed aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied the core martial art from which aikido derives is daitōryū aikijūjutsu which ueshiba studied directly with takeda sōkaku the reviver of that art additionally ueshiba is known to have studied tenjin shinyōryū with tozawa tokusaburō in tokyo in 1901 gotōha yagyū shinganryū under nakai masakatsu in sakai from 1903 to 1908 and judo with kiyoichi takagi 18941972 in tanabe in 1911 the art of ja is the primary technical influence on aikido along with emptyhanded throwing and jointlocking techniques ueshiba incorporated training movements with weapons such as those for the spear ja short staff ja and possibly the bayonet aikido also derives much of its technical structure from the art of swordsmanship ja ueshiba moved to hokkaidō in 1912 and began studying under takeda sokaku in 1915 his official association with daitōryū continued until 1937 however during the latter part of that period ueshiba had already begun to distance himself from takeda and the ja at that time ueshiba referred to his martial art as aiki budō it is unclear exactly when ueshiba began using the name aikido but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the greater japan martial virtue society ja was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of japanese martial arts religious influences after ueshiba left hokkaidō in 1919 he met and was profoundly influenced by onisaburo deguchi the spiritual leader of the ōmotokyō religion a neoshinto movement in ayabe one of the primary features of ōmotokyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during ones life this idea was a great influence on ueshibas martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it in an ideal resolution not only is the receiver unharmed but so is the attacker in addition to the effect on his spiritual growth the connection with deguchi gave ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist as a result of this exposure he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students several of these students would found their own styles of aikido international dissemination aikido was first introduced to the rest of the world in 1951 by minoru mochizuki with a visit to france where he demonstrated aikido techniques to judo students he was followed by tadashi abe in 1952 who came as the official aikikai hombu representative remaining in france for seven years kenji tomiki toured with a delegation of various martial arts through 15 continental states of the united states in 1953 later that year koichi tohei was sent by aikikai hombu to hawaii for a full year where he set up several dōjō this trip was followed by several subsequent visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the united states the united kingdom followed in 1955 italy in 1964 by hiroshi tada and germany in 1965 by katsuaki asai designated the official delegate for europe and africa by morihei ueshiba masamichi noro arrived in france in september 1961 seiichi sugano was appointed to introduce aikido to australia in 1965 today there are aikido dōjō throughout the world steven seagals film debut above the law 1988 is regarded as the first american film to feature aikido in fight sequences proliferation of independent organizations the largest aikido organization is the aikikai foundation which remains under the control of the ueshiba family however aikido has developed into many styles most of which were formed by morihei ueshibas major students the earliest independent styles to emerge were yoseikan aikido begun by minoru mochizuki in 1931 yoshinkan aikido founded by gozo shioda in 1955 and shodokan aikido founded by kenji tomiki in 1967 the emergence of these styles predated ueshibas death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized shodokan aikido however was controversial since it introduced a unique rulebased competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido after ueshibas death in 1969 two more major styles emerged significant controversy arose with the departure of the aikikai hombu dojos chief instructor koichi tohei in 1974 tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder kisshomaru ueshiba who at that time headed the aikikai foundation the disagreement was over the proper role of ja development in regular aikido training after tohei left he formed his own style called shin shin toitsu aikido and the organization that governs it the ki society ja a final major style evolved from ueshibas retirement in iwama ibaraki and the teaching methodology of long term student morihiro saito it is unofficially referred to as the iwama style and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called iwama ryu although iwama style practitioners remained part of the aikikai until saitos death in 2002 followers of saito subsequently split into two groups one remained with the aikikai and the other formed the independent shinshin aikishuren kai in 2004 around saitos son hitohiro saito today the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization have their own headquarters in japan and are taught throughout the world ja the study of ja is an important component of aikido the term does not specifically refer to either physical or mental training as it encompasses both the kanji for ja was written in its older form as 氣 up until the japanese governmental writing reforms after world war ii and now is more prevalently seen in its modern form of 気 this form has the removal of the eight directions denoting the pre and post natal energies of chinese  zh also known in the art of aikido as source energy the character for ja is used in everyday japanese terms such as health or shyness ja has many meanings including ambience mind mood or intention and action however in traditional martial arts and medicine it is often referred to in its more general terminology as life energy gozo shiodas yoshinkan aikido considered one of the hard styles largely follows ueshibas teachings from before world war ii and surmises that the secret to ja lies in timing and the application of the whole bodys strength to a single point in later years ueshibas application of ja in aikido took on a softer more gentle feel this concept was known as takemusu aiki and many of his later students teach about ja from this perspective koichi toheis ki society centers almost exclusively around the study of the empirical albeit subjective experience of ja with students proficiency in aikido techniques and ja development ranked separately training in aikido as in virtually all japanese martial arts there are both physical and mental aspects of training the physical training in aikido is diverse covering both general physical fitness and conditioning as well as specific techniques because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of throws beginners learn how to safely fall or roll the specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs the techniques for defense consist of throws and pins after basic techniques are learned students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents and techniques with weapons fitness physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders flexibility and endurance with less emphasis on strength training in aikido pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements this distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner in aikido specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone mass or power aikidorelated training emphasizes the use of coordinated wholebody movement and balance similar to yoga or pilates for example many dōjōs begin each class with warmup exercises which may include stretching and ja break falls roles of ja and ja aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing prearranged forms ja rather than freestyle practice the basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique ja to initiate an attack against the person who applies the techniquethe  or depending on aikido style also referred to as when applying a throwing technique who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique both halves of the technique that of ja and that of ja are considered essential to aikido training both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation ja learns to blend with and control attacking energy while ja learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous offbalance positions in which ja places them this receiving of the technique is called ja ja continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities eg an exposed side while ja uses position and timing to keep ja offbalance and vulnerable in more advanced training ja will sometimes apply reversal techniques to regain balance and pin or throw ja refers to the act of receiving a technique good ja involves attention to the technique the partner and the immediate environmentit is considered an active part of the process of learning aikido the method of falling itself is also important and is a way for the practitioner to receive an aikido technique safely and minimize risk of injury initial attacks aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in strikingbased arts attacks with intent such as a strong strike or an immobilizing grab are needed to study correct and effective application of technique many of the strikes of aikido resemble cuts from a sword or other grasped object which indicate its origins in techniques intended for armed combat other techniques which explicitly appear to be punches ja are practiced as thrusts with a knife or sword kicks are generally reserved for upperlevel variations reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous and that kicks high kicks in particular were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal japan some basic strikes include beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and the direction of the movement of force of a hold than it is for a strike some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a weapon whereupon a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker while they are grabbing the defender the following are examples of some basic grabs basic techniques the following are a sample of the basic or widely practiced throws and pins many of these techniques derive from daitōryū aikijūjutsu but some others were invented by morihei ueshiba the precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles the following are the terms used by the aikikai foundation note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed they are not universally taught in numeric order implementations aikido makes use of body movement ja to blend the movement of ja with the movement of ja for example an entering ja technique consists of movements inward towards ja while a turning technique uses a pivoting motion additionally an inside technique takes place in front of ja whereas an outside technique takes place to their side a front technique is applied with motion to the front of ja and a rear version is applied with motion towards the rear of ja usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion finally most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture ja techniques where both uke and ja are standing are called ja techniques where both start off in ja are called ja and techniques performed with ja standing and ja sitting are called ja 半身半立 from these few basic techniques there are numerous of possible implementations for example ja can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike perhaps with an ja type of movement to redirect the incoming force or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance perhaps an ja version specific aikido ja are typically referred to with the formula attacktechniquemodifier ja for example refers to any ja technique executed when ja is holding one wrist this could be further specified as ja referring to any forwardmoving ja technique from that grab are strikes or feints employed during an aikido technique some view ja as attacks against vital points meant to cause damage in and of themselves for instance gozo shioda described using ja in a brawl to quickly down a gangs leader others consider ja especially to the face to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques a strike even if it is blocked can startle the target and break their concentration additionally the target may also become unbalanced while attempting to avoid a strike by jerking the head back for example which may allow for an easier throw many sayings about ja are attributed to morihei ueshiba who considered them an essential element of technique weapons weapons training in aikido traditionally includes the short staff ja these techniques closely resemble the use of the bayonet or jūkendō the wooden sword ja and the knife ja some schools incorporate firearmdisarming techniques where either weapontaking andor weaponretention may be taught some schools such as the iwama style of morihiro saito usually spend substantial time practicing with both ja and ja under the names of ja and ja respectively the founder developed many of the emptyhanded techniques from traditional sword spear and bayonet movements consequently the practice of the weapons arts gives insight into the origin of techniques and movements and reinforces the concepts of distance timing foot movement presence and connectedness with ones training partners multiple attackers and ja one feature of aikido is training to defend against multiple attackers often called ja or ja freestyle practice with multiple attackers called is a key part of most curricula and is required for the higherlevel ranks ja exercises a persons ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment strategic choice of techniques based on how they reposition the student relative to other attackers is important in ja training for instance an ja technique might be used to neutralise the current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind in shodokan aikido ja differs in that it is not performed with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker but between two people where both participants attack defend and counter at will in this respect it resembles judo ja injuries in applying a technique during training it is the responsibility of ja to prevent injury to ja by employing a speed and force of application that is appropriate with their partners proficiency in ja when injuries especially to the joints occur they are often the result of a ja misjudging the ability of ja to receive the throw or pin a study of injuries in the martial arts showed that the type of injuries varied considerably from one art to the other soft tissue injuries are one of the most common types of injuries found within aikido as well as joint strain and stubbed fingers and toes several deaths from headandneck injuries caused by aggressive ja in a ja hazing context have been reported mental training aikido training is mental as well as physical emphasizing the ability to relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations this is necessary to enable the practitioner to perform the enterandblend movements that underlie aikido techniques wherein an attack is met with confidence and directness morihei ueshiba once remarked that one must be willing to receive 99 of an opponents attack and stare death in the face in order to execute techniques without hesitation as a martial art concerned not only with fighting proficiency but with the betterment of daily life this mental aspect is of key importance to aikido practitioners uniforms and ranking aikido practitioners commonly called ja outside japan generally progress by promotion through a series of grades ja followed by a series of degrees ja pursuant to formal testing procedures some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners grades often simply white and black belts to distinguish ja and ja grades although some use various belt colors testing requirements vary so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another some dōjōs have an age requirement before students can take the ja rank examfebruary 2021 the uniform worn for practicing aikido ja is similar to the training uniform ja used in most other modern martial arts simple trousers and a wraparound jacket usually white both thick judostyle and thin karatestyle cotton tops are used aikidospecific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow most aikido systems add a pair of wide pleated black or indigo trousers known as ja used also in naginatajutsu kendo and iaido in many schools the wearing of ja is reserved for practitioners with ja ranks or for instructors while others allow all practitioners to wear a ja regardless of rank aikido styles aikido styles vary in their intention as due to its holistic nature the most common differences noted in aikido when observed externally relate to the intensity and realism of training stanley pranin has observed that some criticism may stem from weak attacks from ja allowing for a conditioned response from ja resulting in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners to counteract this some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but in keeping with the core philosophies this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners shodokan aikido addresses the issue by practicing in a competitive format such adaptations are debated between styles with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified or that they are not training for selfdefense or combat effectiveness but spiritual fitness or other reasons reasons for the difference and diversity of teachings intention and forms of aikido can be traced to the shift in training focus after the end of ueshibas seclusion in iwama from 1942 to the mid1950s as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido as a result strikes to vital points by ja entering ja and initiation of techniques by ja the distinction between ja front side and ja back side techniques and the use of weapons were all deemphasized or eliminated from practice conversely some styles of aikido place less importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by ueshiba according to minoru shibata of aikido journal in other words aikido practitioners who focus on aikidos roots in traditional ja or ja are said to be diverging from what ueshiba taught as some critics urge practitioners references external links art categories art concepts in aesthetics the arts visual arts art is a diverse range of human activity and its resulting product that involves creative or imaginative talent generally expressive of technical proficiency beauty emotional power or conceptual ideas there is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art and its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures in the western tradition the three classical branches of visual art are painting sculpture and architecture theatre dance and other performing arts as well as literature music film and other media such as interactive media are included in a broader definition of the arts until the 17th century art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences in modern usage after the 17th century where aesthetic considerations are paramount the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general such as the decorative or applied arts the nature of art and related concepts such as creativity and interpretation are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics the resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art overview in the perspective of the history of art artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind from early prehistoric art to contemporary art however some theorists think that the typical concept of artistic works does not fit well outside modern western societies one early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older latin meaning which roughly translates to skill or craft as associated with words such as artisan english words derived from this meaning include artifact artificial artifice medical arts and military arts however there are many other colloquial uses of the word all with some relation to its etymology over time philosophers like plato aristotle socrates and immanuel kant among others questioned the meaning of art several dialogues in plato tackle questions about art socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses and is not rational he speaks approvingly of this and other forms of divine madness drunkenness eroticism and dreaming in the phaedrus 265ac and yet in the republic wants to outlaw homers great poetic art and laughter as well in ion socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of homer that he expresses in the republic the dialogue ion suggests that homers iliad functioned in the ancient greek world as the bible does today in the modern christian world as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance if only it can be properly interpreted with regards to the literary art and the musical arts aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art each varying in imitation by medium object and manner for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language the forms also differ in their object of imitation comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitationthrough narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankinds advantages over animals the more recent and specific sense of the word art as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early 17th century fine art refers to a skill used to express the artists creativity or to engage the audiences aesthetic sensibilities or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer works of art within this latter sense the word art may refer to several things i a study of a creative skill ii a process of using the creative skill iii a product of the creative skill or iv the audiences experience with the creative skill the creative arts art as discipline are a collection of disciplines which produce artworks art as objects that are compelled by a personal drive art as activity and convey a message mood or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret art as experience art is something that stimulates an individuals thoughts emotions beliefs or ideas through the senses works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects for some scholars such as kant the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression often if the skill is being used in a common or practical way people will consider it a craft instead of art likewise if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art on the other hand crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference however even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and selfexpression the purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas such as in politically spiritually or philosophically motivated art to create a sense of beauty see aesthetics to explore the nature of perception for pleasure or to generate strong emotions the purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent the nature of art has been described by philosopher richard wollheim as one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake and as mimesis or representation art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of aristotle leo tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another benedetto croce and r g collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator the theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of kant and was developed in the early 20th century by roger fry and clive bell more recently thinkers influenced by martin heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for selfexpression and interpretation george dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as the art world has conferred the status of candidate for appreciation larry shiner has described fine art as not an essence or a fate but something we have made art as we have generally understood it is a european invention barely two hundred years old art may be characterized in terms of mimesis its representation of reality narrative storytelling expression communication of emotion or other qualities during the romantic period art came to be seen as a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science history a shell engraved by homo erectus was determined to be between 430000 and 540000 years old a set of eight 130000 years old whitetailed eagle talons bear cut marks and abrasion that indicate manipulation by neanderthals possibly for using it as jewelry a series of tiny drilled snail shells about 75000 years oldwere discovered in a south african cave containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100000 years the oldest piece of art found in europe is the riesenhirschknochen der einhornhöhle dating back 51000 years and made by neanderthals sculptures cave paintings rock paintings and petroglyphs from the upper paleolithic dating to roughly 40000 years ago have been found but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so little is known about the cultures that produced them the first undisputed sculptures and similar art pieces like the venus of hohle fels are the numerous objects found at the caves and ice age art in the swabian jura unesco world heritage site where the oldest nonstationary works of human art yet discovered were found in the form of carved animal and humanoid figurines in addition to the oldest musical instruments unearthed so far with the artifacts dating between 43000 and 35000 bc so being the first centre of human art many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations ancient egypt mesopotamia persia india china ancient greece rome as well as inca maya and olmec each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art because of the size and duration of these civilizations more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times some also have provided the first records of how artists worked for example this period of greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature poise beauty and anatomically correct proportions in byzantine and medieval art of the western middle ages much art focused on the expression of subjects about biblical and religious culture and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world such as the use of gold in the background of paintings or glass in mosaics or windows which also presented figures in idealized patterned flat forms nevertheless a classical realist tradition persisted in small byzantine works and realism steadily grew in the art of catholic europe renaissance art had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world and the place of humans in it reflected in the corporeality of the human body and development of a systematic method of graphical perspective to depict recession in a threedimensional picture space in the east islamic arts rejection of iconography led to emphasis on geometric patterns calligraphy and architecture further east religion dominated artistic styles and forms too india and tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines china saw the flourishing of many art forms jade carving bronzework pottery including the stunning terracotta army of emperor qin poetry calligraphy music painting drama fiction etc chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty so for example tang dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse emphasizing idealized landscapes but ming dynasty paintings are busy and colorful and focus on telling stories via setting and composition japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting woodblock printing became important in japan after the 17th century the western age of enlightenment in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe as well as politically revolutionary visions of a postmonarchist world such as blakes portrayal of newton as a divine geometer or davids propagandistic paintings this led to romantic rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans exemplified in the novels of goethe the late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements such as academic art symbolism impressionism and fauvism among others the history of 20thcentury art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards each being torn down in succession by the next thus the parameters of impressionism expressionism fauvism cubism dadaism surrealism etc cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into western art thus japanese woodblock prints themselves influenced by western renaissance draftsmanship had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development later african sculptures were taken up by picasso and to some extent by matisse similarly in the 19th and 20th centuries the west has had huge impacts on eastern art with originally western ideas like communism and postmodernism exerting a powerful influence modernism the idealistic search for truth gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability theodor w adorno said in 1970 it is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more neither art itself nor art in relationship to the whole nor even the right of art to exist relativism was accepted as an unavoidable truth which led to the period of contemporary art and postmodern criticism where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms which can be appreciated and drawn from only with skepticism and irony furthermore the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture rather than of regional ones in the origin of the work of art martin heidegger a german philosopher and seminal thinker describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth he argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which that which is can be revealed works of art are not merely representations of the way things are but actually produce a communitys shared understanding each time a new artwork is added to any culture the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed historically art and artistic skills and ideas have often been spread through trade an example of this is the silk road where hellenistic iranian indian and chinese influences could mix greco buddhist art is one of the most vivid examples of this interaction the meeting of different cultures and worldviews also influenced artistic creation an example of this is the multicultural port metropolis of trieste at the beginning of the 20th century where james joyce met writers from central europe and the artistic development of new york city as a cultural melting pot forms genres media and styles the creative arts are often divided into more specific categories typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as media genre styles and form art form refers to the elements of art that are independent of its interpretation or significance it covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical composition of the artwork primarily nonsemantic aspects of the work ie figurae such as color contour dimension medium melody space texture and value form may also include design principles such as arrangement balance contrast emphasis harmony proportion proximity and rhythm in general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art focusing respectively on form content and context extreme formalism is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal that is part of the art form philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials techniques and form unfortunately there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties some authors refer to subject matter and contentie denotations and connotationswhile others prefer terms like meaning and significance extreme intentionalism holds that authorial intent plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art conveying the content or essential main idea while all other interpretations can be discarded it defines the subject as the persons or idea represented and the content as the artists experience of that subject for example the composition of napoleon i on his imperial throne is partly borrowed from the statue of zeus at olympia as evidenced by the title the subject is napoleon and the content is ingress representation of napoleon as emperorgod beyond time and space similarly to extreme formalism philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant its restrictive interpretation is socially unhealthy philosophically unreal and politically unwise finally the developing theory of poststructuralism studies arts significance in a cultural context such as the ideas emotions and reactions prompted by a work the cultural context often reduces to the artists techniques and intentions in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism however in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate such as religious and philosophical convictions sociopolitical and economic structures or even climate and geography art criticism continues to grow and develop alongside art skill and craft art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium art can also refer to the developed and efficient use of a language to convey meaning with immediacy or depth art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings thoughts and observations there is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it which facilitates ones thought processes a common view is that the epithet art particular in its elevated sense requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist whether this be a demonstration of technical ability an originality in stylistic approach or a combination of these two traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success for leonardo da vinci art neither more nor less than his other endeavors was a manifestation of skill rembrandts work now praised for its ephemeral virtues was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity at the turn of the 20th century the adroit performances of john singer sargent were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the eras most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast pablo picasso was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled a common contemporary criticism of some modern art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object in conceptual art marcel duchamps fountain is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects readymade and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills tracey emins my bed or damien hirsts the physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living follow this example and also manipulate the mass media emin slept and engaged in other activities in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans hirsts celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts the actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects however there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating handson works of art purpose art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept this does not imply that the purpose of art is vague but that it has had many unique different reasons for being created some of these functions of art are provided in the following outline the different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are nonmotivated and those that are motivated lévistrauss nonmotivated functions the nonmotivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human transcend the individual or do not fulfill a specific external purpose in this sense art as creativity is something humans must do by their very nature ie no other species creates art and is therefore beyond utility motivated functions motivated purposes of art refer to intentional conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator these may be to bring about political change to comment on an aspect of society to convey a specific emotion or mood to address personal psychology to illustrate another discipline to with commercial arts sell a product or used as a form of communication the functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive as many of them may overlap for example art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product ie the movie or video game steps art can be divided into any number of steps one can make an argument for this section divides the creative process into broad three steps but there is no consensus on an exact number preparation in the first step the artist envisions the art in their mind by imagining what their art would look like the artist begins the process of bringing the art into existence preparation of art may involve approaching and researching the subject matter artistic inspiration is one of the main drivers of art and may be considered to stem from instinct impressions and feelings creation in the second step the artist executes the creation of their work the creation of a piece can be affected by factors such as the artists mood surroundings and mental state for example the black paintings by francisco de goya created in the elder years of his life are thought to be so bleak because he was in isolation and because of his experience with war he painted them directly on the walls of his apartment in spain and most likely never discussed them with anyone the beatles stated drugs such as lsd and cannabis influenced some of their greatest hits such as revolver trial and error are considered an integral part of the creation process appreciation the last step is art appreciation which has the subtopic of critique in one study over half of visual arts students agreed that reflection is an essential step of the art process according to education journals the reflection of art is considered an essential part of the experience however an important aspect of art is that others may view and appreciate it as well while many focus on whether those viewinglisteningetc believe the art to be goodsuccessful or not art has profound value beyond its commercial success as a provider of information and health in society art enjoyment can bring about a wide spectrum of emotion due to beauty some art is meant to be practical with its analysis studious meant to stimulate discourse public access since ancient times much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society nevertheless there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available in terms of ownership across large parts of society above all in cheap media such as pottery which persists in the ground and perishable media such as textiles and wood in many different cultures the ceramics of indigenous peoples of the americas are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a social elite though other forms of art may have been reproductive methods such as moulds made massproduction easier and were used to bring highquality ancient roman pottery and greek tanagra figurines to a very wide market cylinder seals were both artistic and practical and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the ancient near east once coins were widely used these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society another important innovation came in the 15th century in europe when printmaking began with small woodcuts mostly religious that were often very small and handcolored and affordable even by peasants who glued them to the walls of their homes printed books were initially very expensive but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations popular prints of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries in 1661 the city of basel in switzerland opened the first public museum of art in the world the kunstmuseum basel today its collection is distinguished by an impressively wide historic span from the early 15th century up to the immediate present its various areas of emphasis give it international standing as one of the most significant museums of its kind these encompass paintings and drawings by artists active in the upper rhine region between 1400 and 1600 and on the art of the 19th to 21st centuries public buildings and monuments secular and religious by their nature normally address the whole of society and visitors as viewers and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design egyptian temples are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public rather than the areas seen only by the priests many areas of royal palaces castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen either by anybody or by those able to pay a small price or those wearing the correct clothes regardless of who they were as at the palace of versailles where the appropriate extra accessories silver shoe buckles and a sword could be hired from shops outside special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries as with the orleans collection mostly housed in a wing of the palais royal in paris which could be visited for most of the 18th century in italy the art tourism of the grand tour became a major industry from the renaissance onwards and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible the british royal collection remains distinct but large donations such as the old royal library were made from it to the british museum established in 1753 the uffizi in florence opened entirely as a gallery in 1765 though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants offices for a long time before the building now occupied by the prado in madrid was built before the french revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in vienna munich and other capitals the opening of the musée du louvre during the french revolution in 1793 as a public museum for much of the former french royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art transferring ownership to a republican state but was a continuation of trends already well established most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone however museums do not only provide availability to art but do also influence the way art is being perceived by the audience as studies found thus the museum itself is not only a blunt stage for the presentation of art but plays an active and vital role in the overall perception of art in modern society museums in the united states tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses the metropolitan museum of art in new york city for example was created by john taylor johnston a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum but despite all this at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status there have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object one of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold it is necessary to present something more than mere objects said the major post war german artist joseph beuys this time period saw the rise of such things as performance art video art and conceptual art the idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind or was an idea it could not be bought and sold democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s artists broadly identified under the heading of conceptual art  substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form  have endeavored to undermine the art object qua object in the decades since these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition dvds of video works invitations to exclusive performance art pieces and the objects left over from conceptual pieces many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art the marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it and the artwork remains an upperclass activity with the widespread use of dvd recording technology in the early 2000s artists and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors controversies art has long been controversial that is to say disliked by some viewers for a wide variety of reasons though most premodern controversies are dimly recorded or completely lost to a modern view iconoclasm is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons including religious ones aniconism is a general dislike of either all figurative images or often just religious ones and has been a thread in many major religions it has been a crucial factor in the history of islamic art where depictions of muhammad remain especially controversial much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers parties or other groups artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by art critics though often much less so by a wider public the iconographic content of art could cause controversy as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the swoon of the virgin in scenes of the crucifixion of jesus the last judgment by michelangelo was controversial for various reasons including breaches of decorum through nudity and the apollolike pose of christ the content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist but with the advent of romanticism and economic changes in the production of art the artists vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art increasing the incidence of controversies though often reducing their significance strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy théodore géricaults raft of the medusa 1820 was in part a political commentary on a recent event édouard manets le déjeuner sur lherbe 1863 was considered scandalous not because of the nude woman but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time rather than in robes of the antique world john singer sargents madame pierre gautreau madam x 1884 caused a controversy over the reddish pink used to color the womans ear lobe considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the highsociety models reputation the gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century in the 20th century pablo picassos guernica 1937 used arresting cubist techniques and stark monochromatic oils to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small ancient basque town leon golubs interrogation iii 1981 depicts a female nude hooded detainee strapped to a chair her legs open to reveal her sexual organs surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing andres serranos piss christ 1989 is a photograph of a crucifix sacred to the christian religion and representing christs sacrifice and final suffering submerged in a glass of the artists own urine the resulting uproar led to comments in the united states senate about public funding of the arts theory before modernism aesthetics in western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of realism or truth to nature and the ideal ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries this concern is largely absent in other traditions of art the aesthetic theorist john ruskin who championed what he saw as the naturalism of j m w turner saw arts role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature the definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century richard wollheim distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art the realist whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view the objectivist whereby it is also an absolute value but is dependent on general human experience and the relativist position whereby it is not an absolute value but depends on and varies with the human experience of different humans arrival of modernism the arrival of modernism in the late 19th century led to a radical break in the conception of the function of art and then again in the late 20th century with the advent of postmodernism clement greenbergs 1960 article modernist painting defines modern art as the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself greenberg originally applied this idea to the abstract expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat nonillusionistic abstract painting realistic naturalistic art had dissembled the medium using art to conceal art modernism used art to call attention to art the limitations that constitute the medium of paintingthe flat surface the shape of the support the properties of the pigmentwere treated by the old masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly under modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors and were acknowledged openly after greenberg several important art theorists emerged such as michael fried t j clark rosalind krauss linda nochlin and griselda pollock among others though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists greenbergs definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century pop artists like andy warhol became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture as well as the art world artists of the 1980s 1990s and 2000s expanded this technique of selfcriticism beyond high art to all cultural imagemaking including fashion images comics billboards and pornography duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kindeverything however the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction there is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this in the invention of art a cultural history larry shiner examines the construction of the modern system of the arts ie fine art he finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system fine art held art to be any skilled human activity for example ancient greek society did not possess the term art but techne techne can be understood neither as art or craft the reason being that the distinctions of art and craft are historical products that came later on in human history techne included painting sculpting and music but also cooking medicine horsemanship geometry carpentry prophecy and farming etc new criticism and the intentional fallacy following duchamp during the first half of the 20th century a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art including the literary arts and the visual arts to each other this resulted in the rise of the new criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy at issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art whatever its specific form should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art or if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist in 1946 william k wimsatt and monroe beardsley published a classic and controversial new critical essay entitled the intentional fallacy in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an authors intention or intended meaning in the analysis of a literary work for wimsatt and beardsley the words on the page were all that mattered importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant and potentially distracting in another essay the affective fallacy which served as a kind of sister essay to the intentional fallacy wimsatt and beardsley also discounted the readers personalemotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text this fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the readerresponse school of literary theory ironically one of the leading theorists from this school stanley fish was himself trained by new critics fish criticizes wimsatt and beardsley in his 1970 essay literature in the reader as summarized by berys gaut and paisley livingston in their essay the creation of art structuralist and poststructuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of new criticism beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the socalled autonomy of art but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms assumption that the artists activities and experience were a privileged critical topic these authors contend that antiintentionalists such as formalists hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art so details of the act of creating a work though possibly of interest in themselves have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work gaut and livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that intentionalists unlike formalists hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works they quote richard wollheim as stating that the task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of but terminating on the work of art itself linguistic turn and its debate the end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy or the innocent eye debate in the philosophy of art this debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition namely the structuralism of ferdinand de saussure and the ensuing movement of poststructuralism in 1981 the artist mark tansey created a work of art titled the innocent eye as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century influential theorists include judith butler luce irigaray julia kristeva michel foucault and jacques derrida the power of language more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes in art history and historical discourse was explored by hayden white the fact that language is not a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of philosophy of language which originated in the works of johann georg hamann and wilhelm von humboldt ernst gombrich and nelson goodman in his book languages of art an approach to a theory of symbols came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s he was challenged on the basis of research done by the nobel prize winning psychologist roger sperry who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone the linguistic turn and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable sperrys view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as nick zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives classification disputes disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included cubist and impressionist paintings duchamps fountain the movies j s g boggs superlative imitations of banknotes conceptual art and video games philosopher david novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem rather the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life are so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art according to novitz classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper for example when the daily mail criticized hirsts and emins work by arguing for 1000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces today pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all they are not advancing a definition or theory about art but questioning the value of hirsts and emins work in 1998 arthur danto suggested a thought experiment showing that the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities cultural interpretation an art theory of some kind is therefore constitutive of an objects arthood antiart is a label for art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of art it is a term associated with dadaism and attributed to marcel duchamp just before world war i when he was making art from found objects one of these fountain 1917 an ordinary urinal has achieved considerable prominence and influence on art antiart is a feature of work by situationist international the lofi mail art movement and the young british artists though it is a form still rejected by the stuckists who describe themselves as antiantiart architecture is often included as one of the visual arts however like the decorative arts or advertising it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in a way that they usually are not in a painting for example value judgment somewhat in relation to the above the word art is also used to apply judgments of value as in such expressions as that meal was a work of art the cook is an artist or the art of deception the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised it is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism at the simplest level a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive though perception is always colored by experience and is necessarily subjective it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art however good art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers in other words an artists prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic also art often depicts terrible images made for social moral or thoughtprovoking reasons for example francisco goyas painting depicting the spanish shootings of 3 may 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians yet at the same time the horrific imagery demonstrates goyas keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage thus the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction if any is required to define art the assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing indeed the reverse is often true that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a reinvigoration of aesthetic sensibility and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality yet they all seem to agree in at least one point once their aesthetic choices are accepted the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion it can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent but they do not have to do so consciously art may be considered an exploration of the human condition that is what it is to be human by extension it has been argued by emily l spratt that the development of artificial intelligence especially in regard to its uses with images necessitates a reevaluation of aesthetic theory in art history today and a reconsideration of the limits of human creativity art and law an essential legal issue are art forgeries plagiarism replicas and works that are strongly based on other works of art intellectual property law plays a significant role in the art world copyright protection is granted to artists for their original works providing them with exclusive rights to reproduce distribute and display their creations this safeguard empowers artists to govern the usage of their work and safeguard against unauthorized copying or infringement the trade in works of art or the export from a country may be subject to legal regulations internationally there are also extensive efforts to protect the works of art created the un unesco and blue shield international try to ensure effective protection at the national level and to intervene directly in the event of armed conflicts or disasters this can particularly affect museums archives art collections and excavation sites this should also secure the economic basis of a country especially because works of art are often of tourist importance the founding president of blue shield international karl von habsburg explained an additional connection between the destruction of cultural property and the cause of flight during a mission in lebanon in april 2019 cultural goods are part of the identity of the people who live in a certain place if you destroy their culture you also destroy their identity many people are uprooted often no longer have any prospects and as a result flee from their homeland in order to preserve the diversity of cultural identity unesco protects the living human treasure through the convention for the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage see also references works cited bibliography

extinctions taxa named by john william salter agnostida are an order of extinct arthropods which have classically been seen as a group of highly modified trilobites though some recent research has doubted this placement regardless they appear to be close relatives as part of the artiopoda they are present in the lower cambrian fossil record along with trilobites from the redlichiida corynexochida and ptychopariida orders and were highly diverse throughout the cambrian agnostidan diversity severely declined during the cambrianordovician transition and the last agnostidans went extinct in the late ordovician systematics the agnostida are divided into two suborders  agnostina and eodiscina  which are then subdivided into a number of families as a group agnostids are isopygous meaning their pygidium is similar in size and shape to their cephalon most agnostid species were eyeless the systematic position of the order agnostida within the class trilobita remains uncertain and there has been continuing debate whether they are trilobites or a stem group the challenge to the status has focused on agnostina partly due to the juveniles of one genus have been found with legs differing dramatically from those of adult trilobites suggesting they are not members of the lamellipedian clade of which trilobites are a part instead the limbs of agnostids closely resemble those of stem group crustaceans although they lack the proximal endite which defines that group the study suggested that they were likely the sister taxon to the crustacean stem lineage and as such part of the clade crustaceomorpha other researchers have suggested based on a cladistic analyses of dorsal exoskeletal features that eodiscina and agnostida are closely united and the eodiscina descended from the trilobite order ptychopariida a 2019 study of adult specimens with preserved soft tissue from the burgess shale found that agnostidans shared morphological similarities to trilobites and other related artiopodans like nektaspids and their placement as stemcrustaceans was unsupported the study recovered agnostidans as the sister group to other trilobites within the artiopoda ecology scientists have long debated whether the agnostids lived a pelagic or a benthic lifestyle their lack of eyes a morphology not wellsuited for swimming and their fossils found in association with other benthic trilobites suggest a benthic bottomdwelling mode of life they are likely to have lived on areas of the ocean floor which received little or no light and fed on detritus which descended from upper layers of the sea to the bottom their wide geographic dispersion in the fossil record is uncharacteristic of benthic animals suggesting a pelagic existence the thoracic segment appears to form a hinge between the head and pygidium allowing for a bivalved ostracodantype lifestyle the orientation of the thoracic appendages appears illsuited for benthic living recent work suggests that some agnostids were benthic predators engaging in cannibalism and possibly packhunting behavior they are sometimes preserved within the voids of other organisms for instance within empty hyolith conchs within sponges worm tubes and under the carapaces of bivalved arthropods presumably in order to hide from predators or strong storm currents or maybe whilst scavenging for food in the case of the tapering worm tubes selkirkia trilobites are always found with their heads directed towards the opening of the tube suggesting that they reversed in the absence of any moulted carapaces suggests that moulting was not their primary reason for seeking shelter references external links abortion categories abortion human reproduction wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate wikipedia emergency medicine articles ready to translate abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus an abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion these occur in approximately 30 to 40 of all pregnancies when deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy it is called an induced abortion or less frequently induced miscarriage the unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion the most common reason women give for having an abortion is for birthtiming and limiting family size other reasons reported include maternal health an inability to afford a child domestic violence lack of support feeling they are too young wishing to complete education or advance a career and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest when done legally in industrialized societies induced abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine unsafe abortionsthose performed by people lacking the necessary skills or in inadequately resourced settingsare responsible for between 513 of maternal deaths especially in the developing world however medication abortions that are selfmanaged are highly effective and safe throughout the first trimester public health data shows that making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions the drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy the most common surgical technique involves dilating the cervix and using a suction device birth control such as the pill or intrauterine devices can be used immediately following abortion when performed legally and safely on a woman who desires it induced abortions do not increase the risk of longterm mental or physical problems in contrast unsafe abortions performed by unskilled individuals with hazardous equipment or in unsanitary facilities cause between 22000 and 44000 deaths and 69 million hospital admissions each year the world health organization states that access to legal safe and comprehensive abortion care including postabortion care is essential for the attainment of the highest possible level of sexual and reproductive health historically abortions have been attempted using herbal medicines sharp tools forceful massage or other traditional methods around 73 million abortions are performed each year in the world with about 45 done unsafely abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008 before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased 2018 37 of the worlds women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed abortion rates are similar between countries that restrict abortion and countries that broadly allow it though this is partly because countries which restrict abortion tend to have higher unintended pregnancy rates globally there has been a widespread trend towards greater legal access to abortion since 1973 but there remains debate with regard to moral religious ethical and legal issues those who oppose abortion often argue that an embryo or fetus is a person with a right to life and thus equate abortion with murder those who support abortions legality often argue that it is a womans reproductive right others favor legal and accessible abortion as a public health measure abortion laws and views of the procedure are different around the world in some countries abortion is legal and women have the right to make the choice about abortion in some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape fetal defects poverty risk to a womans health or incest types induced approximately 205 million pregnancies occur each year worldwide over a third are unintended and about a fifth end in induced abortion most abortions result from unintended pregnancies in the united kingdom 1 to 2 of abortions are done because of genetic problems in the fetus a pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in several ways the manner selected often depends upon the gestational age of the embryo or fetus which increases in size as the pregnancy progresses legality regional availability and a womans or her doctors personal preference may inform her choice of a specific procedure reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective an abortion is medically referred to as a therapeutic abortion when it is performed to save the life of the pregnant woman to prevent harm to the womans physical or mental health to terminate a pregnancy where indications are that the child will have a significantly increased chance of mortality or morbidity or to selectively reduce the number of fetuses to lessen health risks associated with multiple pregnancy an abortion is referred to as elective or voluntary when it is performed at the request of the woman for nonmedical reasons confusion sometimes arises over the term elective because elective surgery generally refers to all scheduled surgery whether medically necessary or not spontaneous miscarriage also known as spontaneous abortion is the unintentional expulsion of an embryo or fetus before the 24th week of gestation a pregnancy that ends before 37 weeks of gestation resulting in a liveborn infant is a premature birth or a preterm birth when a fetus dies in utero after viability or during delivery it is usually termed stillborn premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap studies of pregnant women in the us and china have shown that between 40 and 60 of embryos do not progress to birth the vast majority of miscarriages occur before the woman is aware that she is pregnant and many pregnancies spontaneously abort before medical practitioners can detect an embryo between 15 and 30 of known pregnancies end in clinically apparent miscarriage depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman 80 of these spontaneous abortions happen in the first trimester the most common cause of spontaneous abortion during the first trimester is chromosomal abnormalities of the embryo or fetus accounting for at least 50 of sampled early pregnancy losses other causes include vascular disease such as lupus diabetes other hormonal problems infection and abnormalities of the uterus advancing maternal age and a womans history of previous spontaneous abortions are the two leading factors associated with a greater risk of spontaneous abortion a spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental trauma intentional trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered induced abortion or feticide methods medical medical abortions are those induced by abortifacient pharmaceuticals medical abortion became an alternative method of abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and the antiprogestogen mifepristone also known as ru486 in the 1980s the most common early first trimester medical abortion regimens use mifepristone in combination with misoprostol or sometimes another prostaglandin analog gemeprost up to 10 weeks 70 days gestational age methotrexate in combination with a prostaglandin analog up to 7 weeks gestation or a prostaglandin analog alone mifepristonemisoprostol combination regimens work faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexatemisoprostol combination regimens and combination regimens are more effective than misoprostol alone particularly in the second trimester medical abortion regimens involving mifepristone followed by misoprostol in the cheek between 24 and 48 hours later are effective when performed before 70 days gestation in very early abortions up to 7 weeks gestation medical abortion using a mifepristonemisoprostol combination regimen is considered to be more effective than surgical abortion vacuum aspiration especially when clinical practice does not include detailed inspection of aspirated tissue early medical abortion regimens using mifepristone followed 2448 hours later by buccal or vaginal misoprostol are 98 effective up to 9 weeks gestational age from 9 to 10 weeks efficacy decreases modestly to 94 if medical abortion fails surgical abortion must be used to complete the procedure early medical abortions account for the majority of abortions before 9 weeks gestation in britain france switzerland united states and the nordic countries medical abortion regimens using mifepristone in combination with a prostaglandin analog are the most common methods used for second trimester abortions in canada most of europe china and india in contrast to the united states where 96 of second trimester abortions are performed surgically by dilation and evacuation a 2020 cochrane systematic review concluded that providing women with medications to take home to complete the second stage of the procedure for an early medical abortion results in an effective abortion further research is required to determine if selfadministered medical abortion is as safe as provideradministered medical abortion where a health care professional is present to help manage the medical abortion safely permitting women to selfadminister abortion medication has the potential to improve access to abortion other research gaps that were identified include how to best support women who choose to take the medication home for a selfadministered abortion surgical up to 15 weeks gestation suctionaspiration or vacuum aspiration are the most common surgical methods of induced abortion manual vacuum aspiration mva consists of removing the fetus or embryo placenta and membranes by suction using a manual syringe while electric vacuum aspiration eva uses an electric pump these techniques can both be used very early in pregnancy mva can be used up to 14 weeks but is more often used earlier in the us eva can be used later mva also known as minisuction and menstrual extraction or eva can be used in very early pregnancy when cervical dilation may not be required dilation and curettage dc refers to opening the cervix dilation and removing tissue curettage via suction or sharp instruments dc is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy investigation of abnormal bleeding and abortion the world health organization recommends sharp curettage only when suction aspiration is unavailable dilation and evacuation de used after 12 to 16 weeks consists of opening the cervix and emptying the uterus using surgical instruments and suction de is performed vaginally and does not require an incision intact dilation and extraction dx refers to a variant of de sometimes used after 18 to 20 weeks when removal of an intact fetus improves surgical safety or for other reasons abortion may also be performed surgically by hysterotomy or gravid hysterectomy hysterotomy abortion is a procedure similar to a caesarean section and is performed under general anesthesia it requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and can be used during later stages of pregnancy gravid hysterectomy refers to removal of the whole uterus while still containing the pregnancy hysterotomy and hysterectomy are associated with much higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality than de or induction abortion first trimester procedures can generally be performed using local anesthesia while second trimester methods may require deep sedation or general anesthesia labor induction abortion in places lacking the necessary medical skill for dilation and extraction or when preferred by practitioners an abortion can be induced by first inducing labor and then inducing fetal demise if necessary this is sometimes called induced miscarriage this procedure may be performed from 13 weeks gestation to the third trimester although it is very uncommon in the united states more than 80 of induced abortions throughout the second trimester are laborinduced abortions in sweden and other nearby countries only limited data are available comparing laborinduced abortion with the dilation and extraction method unlike de laborinduced abortions after 18 weeks may be complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival which may be legally characterized as live birth for this reason laborinduced abortion is legally risky in the united states other methods historically a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in folk medicine among these are tansy pennyroyal black cohosh and the nowextinct silphium4447 6263 154155 230231 in 1978 one woman in colorado died and another developed organ damage when they attempted to terminate their pregnancies by taking pennyroyal oil because the indiscriminant use of herbs as abortifacients can cause seriouseven lethalside effects such as multiple organ failure such use is not recommended by physicians abortion is sometimes attempted by causing trauma to the abdomen the degree of force if severe can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing miscarriage in southeast asia there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal massage one of the bas reliefs decorating the temple of angkor wat in cambodia depicts a demon performing such an abortion upon a woman who has been sent to the underworld reported methods of unsafe selfinduced abortion include misuse of misoprostol and insertion of nonsurgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hangers into the uterus these and other methods to terminate pregnancy may be called induced miscarriage such methods are rarely used in countries where surgical abortion is legal and available safety the health risks of abortion depend principally on how and under what conditions the procedure is performed the world health organization who defines unsafe abortions as those performed by unskilled individuals with hazardous equipment or in unsanitary facilities legal abortions performed in the developed world are among the safest procedures in medicine according to a 2012 study in the journal obstetrics  gynecology by f g raymond and d a grimes in the united states the risk of maternal mortality is 14 times lower after induced abortion than after childbirth cdc estimated in 2019 that us pregnancyrelated mortality was 172 maternal deaths per 100000 live births while the us abortion mortality rate was 043 maternal deaths per 100000 procedures in the uk guidelines of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists state that women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term worldwide on average abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term a 2007 study reported that 26 of all pregnancies worldwide are terminated by induced abortion whereas deaths from improperly performed abortion procedures constitute 13 of maternal mortality globally in indonesia in 2000 it was estimated that 2 million pregnancies ended in abortion 45 million pregnancies were carried to term and 1416 percent of maternal deaths resulted from abortion in the us from 2000 to 2009 abortion had a mortality rate lower than plastic surgery lower or similar to running a marathon and about equivalent to traveling 760 in a passenger carray2014 five years after seeking abortion services women who gave birth after being denied an abortion reported worse health than women who had either first or second trimester abortions the risk of abortionrelated mortality increases with gestational age but remains lower than that of childbirth outpatient abortion is as safe from 64 to 70 days gestation as it before 63 days there is little difference in terms of safety and efficacy between medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol and surgical abortion vacuum aspiration in early first trimester abortions up to 10 weeks gestation medical abortion using the prostaglandin analog misoprostol alone is less effective and more painful than medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol or surgical abortion vacuum aspiration in the first trimester is the safest method of surgical abortion and can be performed in a primary care office abortion clinic or hospital complications which are rare can include uterine perforation pelvic infection and retained products of conception requiring a second procedure to evacuate infections account for onethird of abortionrelated deaths in the united states the rate of complications of vacuum aspiration abortion in the first trimester is similar regardless of whether the procedure is performed in a hospital surgical center or office preventive antibiotics such as doxycycline or metronidazole are typically given before abortion procedures as they are believed to substantially reduce the risk of postoperative uterine infection however antibiotics are not routinely given with abortion pills the rate of failed procedures does not appear to vary significantly depending on whether the abortion is performed by a doctor or a midlevel practitioner complications after second trimester abortion are similar to those after first trimester abortion and depend somewhat on the method chosen the risk of death from abortion approaches roughly half the risk of death from childbirth the farther along a woman is in pregnancy from one in a million before 9 weeks gestation to nearly one in ten thousand at 21 weeks or more as measured from the last menstrual period it appears that having had a prior surgical uterine evacuation whether because of induced abortion or treatment of miscarriage correlates with a small increase in the risk of preterm birth in future pregnancies the studies supporting this did not control for factors not related to abortion or miscarriage and hence the causes of this correlation have not been determined although multiple possibilities have been suggested some purported risks of abortion are promoted primarily by antiabortion groups but lack scientific support for example the question of a link between induced abortion and breast cancer has been investigated extensively major medical and scientific bodies including the who national cancer institute american cancer society royal college of obgyn and american congress of obgyn have concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer in the past even illegality has not automatically meant that the abortions were unsafe referring to the us historian linda gordon states in fact illegal abortions in this country have an impressive safety record25 according to rickie solinger authors jerome bates and edward zawadzki describe the case of an illegal abortionist in the eastern us in the early 20th century who was proud of having successfully completed 13844 abortions without any fatality59 in 1870s new york city the famous abortionistmidwife madame restell anna trow lohman appears to have lost very few women among her more than 100000 patientsa lower mortality rate than the childbirth mortality rate at the time in 1936 the prominent professor of obstetrics and gynecology frederick j taussig wrote that a cause of increasing mortality during the years of illegality in the us was that mental health current evidence finds no relationship between most induced abortions and mental health problems other than those expected for any unwanted pregnancy a report by the american psychological association concluded that a womans first abortion is not a threat to mental health when carried out in the first trimester with such women no more likely to have mentalhealth problems than those carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term the mentalhealth outcome of a womans second or greater abortion is less certain some older reviews concluded that abortion was associated with an increased risk of psychological problems however later reviews of the medical literature found that they did not use an appropriate control group when a control group is utilized receiving abortion is not associated with adverse psychological outcomes however women seeking abortion who are denied access to abortion have an increase in anxiety after the denial although some studies show negative mentalhealth outcomes in women who choose abortions after the first trimester because of fetal abnormalities more rigorous research would be needed to show this conclusively some proposed negative psychological effects of abortion have been referred to by antiabortion advocates as a separate condition called postabortion syndrome but this is not recognized by medical or psychological professionals in the united states a 2020 long termstudy among us women found that about 99 of women felt that they made the right decision five years after they had an abortion relief was the primary emotion with few women feeling sadness or guilt social stigma was a main factor predicting negative emotions and regret years later the researchers also stated these results add to the scientific evidence that emotions about an abortion are associated with personal and social context and are not a product of the abortion procedure itself unsafe abortion women seeking an abortion may use unsafe methods especially when it is legally restricted they may attempt selfinduced abortion or seek the help of a person without proper medical training or facilities this can lead to severe complications such as incomplete abortion sepsis hemorrhage and damage to internal organs unsafe abortions are a major cause of injury and death among women worldwide although data are imprecise it is estimated that approximately 20 million unsafe abortions are performed annually with 97 taking place in developing countries unsafe abortions are believed to result in millions of injuries estimates of deaths vary according to methodology and have ranged from 37000 to 70000 in the past decade deaths from unsafe abortion account for around 13 of all maternal deaths the world health organization believes that mortality has fallen since the 1990s to reduce the number of unsafe abortions public health organizations have generally advocated emphasizing the legalization of abortion training of medical personnel and ensuring access to reproductivehealth services a major factor in whether abortions are performed safely or not is the legal standing of abortion countries with restrictive abortion laws have higher rates of unsafe abortion and similar overall abortion rates compared to those where abortion is legal and available for example the 1996 legalization of abortion in south africa had an immediate positive impact on the frequency of abortionrelated complications with abortionrelated deaths dropping by more than 90 similar reductions in maternal mortality have been observed after other countries have liberalized their abortion laws such as romania and nepal a 2011 study concluded that in the united states some statelevel antiabortion laws are correlated with lower rates of abortion in that state the analysis however did not take into account travel to other states without such laws to obtain an abortion in addition a lack of access to effective contraception contributes to unsafe abortion it has been estimated that the incidence of unsafe abortion could be reduced by up to 75 from 20 million to 5 million annually if modern family planning and maternal health services were readily available globally rates of such abortions may be difficult to measure because they can be reported variously as miscarriage induced miscarriage menstrual regulation miniabortion and regulation of a delayedsuspended menstruation forty percent of the worlds women are able to access therapeutic and elective abortions within gestational limits while an additional 35 percent have access to legal abortion if they meet certain physical mental or socioeconomic criteria while maternal mortality seldom results from safe abortions unsafe abortions result in 70000 deaths and 5 million disabilities per year complications of unsafe abortion account for approximately an eighth of maternal mortalities worldwide though this varies by region secondary infertility caused by an unsafe abortion affects an estimated 24 million women the rate of unsafe abortions has increased from 44 to 49 between 1995 and 2008 health education access to family planning and improvements in health care during and after abortion have been proposed to address consequences of unsafe abortion incidence there are two commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of abortion in many places where abortion is illegal or carries a heavy social stigma medical reporting of abortion is not reliable for this reason estimates of the incidence of abortion must be made without determining certainty related to standard error the number of abortions performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in the early 2000s with 416 million having been performed in 2003 and 438 million having been performed in 2008 the abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women per year though it was 24 per 1000 women per year for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women per year for developing countries the same 2012 study indicated that in 2008 the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21 worldwide with 26 in developed countries and 20 in developing countries on average the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely the unsafe abortion rate in developing countries is partly attributable to lack of access to modern contraceptives according to the guttmacher institute providing access to contraceptives would result in about 145 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38000 fewer deaths from unsafe abortion annually worldwide the rate of legal induced abortion varies extensively worldwide according to the report of employees of guttmacher institute it ranged from 7 per 1000 women per year germany and switzerland to 30 per 1000 women per year estonia in countries with complete statistics in 2008 the proportion of pregnancies that ended in induced abortion ranged from about 10 israel the netherlands and switzerland to 30 estonia in the same group though it might be as high as 36 in hungary and romania whose statistics were deemed incomplete an american study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of contraception at the time of becoming pregnant inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms and threequarters of those using the birth control pill 42 of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage of the other half of women who were not using contraception at the time of becoming pregnant the vast majority had used contraception at some point in the past indicating some level of dissatisfaction with the contraceptive options available to them indeed 32 of these contraceptive nonusers cited concerns about contraceptive methods as their reason for nonuse and a more recent study found similar results taken together these statistics suggest that new contraceptive methods such as nonhormonal contraceptives or male contraceptives could reduce unintended pregnancy and abortion rates the guttmacher institute has found that most abortions in the united states are obtained by minority women because minority women have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy in a 2022 analysis by the kaiser family foundation while people of color comprise 44 of the population in mississippi 59 of the population in texas 42 of the population in louisiana and 35 of the population in alabama they comprise 80 74 72 and 70 respectively of those receiving abortions gestational age and method abortion rates vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced in 2003 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc reported that 26 of reported legal induced abortions in the united states were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks gestation 18 at 7 weeks 15 at 8 weeks 18 at 9 through 10 weeks 10 at 11 through 12 weeks 6 at 13 through 15 weeks 4 at 16 through 20 weeks and 1 at more than 21 weeks 91 of these were classified as having been done by curettage suctionaspiration dilation and curettage dilation and evacuation 8 by medical means mifepristone 1 by intrauterine instillation saline or prostaglandin and 1 by other including hysterotomy and hysterectomy according to the cdc due to data collection difficulties the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond 20 weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion the guttmacher institute estimated there were 2200 intact dilation and extraction procedures in the us during 2000 this accounts for 02 of the total number of abortions performed that year similarly in england and wales in 2006 89 of terminations occurred at or under 12 weeks 9 between 13 and 19 weeks and 2 at or over 20 weeks 64 of those reported were by vacuum aspiration 6 by de and 30 were medical there are more second trimester abortions in developing countries such as china india and vietnam than in developed countries there are both medical and nonmedical reasons to have an abortion later in pregnancy after 20 weeks a study was conducted from 2008 to 2010 at the university of california san francisco where more than 440 women were asked about why they experienced delays in obtaining abortion care if there were any this study found that almost half of individuals who obtained an abortion after 20 weeks did not suspect that they were pregnant until later in their pregnancy other barriers to abortion care found in the study included lack of information about where to access an abortion difficulties with transportation lack of insurance coverage and inability to pay for the abortion procedure medical reasons for seeking an abortion later in pregnancy include fetal anomalies and health risk to the pregnant person there are diagnostic tests that can diagnose down syndrome or cystic fibrosis as early as 10 weeks into gestation but structural fetal anomalies are often detected much later in pregnancy a proportion of structural fetal anomalies are lethal which means that the fetus will almost certainly die before or shortly after birth lifethreatening conditions may also develop later in pregnancy such as early severe preeclampsia newly diagnosed cancer in need of urgent treatment and intrauterine infection chorioamnionitis which often occurs along with premature rupture of the amniotic sac pprom if serious medical conditions such as these arise before the fetus is viable the person carrying the pregnancy may pursue an abortion to preserve their own health motivation personal the reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world some of the reasons may include an inability to afford a child domestic violence lack of support feeling they are too young and the wish to complete education or advance a career additional reasons include not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest societal some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures these might include the preference for children of a specific sex or race disapproval of single or early motherhood stigmatization of people with disabilities insufficient economic support for families lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods or efforts toward population control such as chinas onechild policy these factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or sexselective abortion in cultures where there is a preference for male children some women have sex selective abortions which have partially replaced the earlier practice of female infanticide maternal and fetal health an additional factor is maternal health which was listed as the main reason by about a third of women in 3 of 27 countries and about 7 of women in a further 7 of these 27 countries in the us the supreme court decisions in roe v wade and doe v bolton ruled that the states interest in the life of the fetus became compelling only at the point of viability defined as the point at which the fetus can survive independently of its mother even after the point of viability the state cannot favor the life of the fetus over the life or health of the pregnant woman under the right of privacy physicians must be free to use their medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother on the same day that the court decided roe it also decided doe v bolton in which the court defined health very broadly the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factorsphysical emotional psychological familial and the womans agerelevant to the wellbeing of the patient all these factors may relate to health this allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment12001201 public opinion shifted in america following television personality sherri finkbines discovery during her fifth month of pregnancy that she had been exposed to thalidomide unable to obtain a legal abortion in the united states she traveled to sweden from 1962 to 1965 an outbreak of german measles left 15000 babies with severe birth defects in 1967 the american medical association publicly supported liberalization of abortion laws a national opinion research center poll in 1965 showed 73 supported abortion when the mothers life was at risk 57 when birth defects were present and 59 for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest cancer the rate of cancer during pregnancy is 0021 and in many cases cancer of the mother leads to consideration of abortion to protect the life of the mother or in response to the potential damage that may occur to the fetus during treatment this is particularly true for cervical cancer the most common type of which occurs in 1 of every 200013000 pregnancies for which initiation of treatment cannot coexist with preservation of fetal life unless neoadjuvant chemotherapy is chosen very early stage cervical cancers i and iia may be treated by radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection radiation therapy or both while later stages are treated by radiotherapy chemotherapy may be used simultaneously treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy also involves fetal considerations because lumpectomy is discouraged in favor of modified radical mastectomy unless lateterm pregnancy allows followup radiation therapy to be administered after the birth exposure to a single chemotherapy drug is estimated to cause a 7517 risk of teratogenic effects on the fetus with higher risks for multiple drug treatments treatment with more than 40 gy of radiation usually causes spontaneous abortion exposure to much lower doses during the first trimester especially 8 to 15 weeks of development can cause intellectual disability or microcephaly and exposure at this or subsequent stages can cause reduced intrauterine growth and birth weight exposures above 00050025 gy cause a dosedependent reduction in iq it is possible to greatly reduce exposure to radiation with abdominal shielding depending on how far the area to be irradiated is from the fetus the process of birth itself may also put the mother at risk according to li et al vaginal delivery may result in dissemination of neoplastic cells into lymphovascular channels haemorrhage cervical laceration and implantation of malignant cells in the episiotomy site while abdominal delivery may delay the initiation of nonsurgical treatment history and religion since ancient times abortions have been done using a number of methods including herbal medicines acting as abortifacients sharp tools through the use of force or through other traditional medicine methods induced abortion has a long history and can be traced back to civilizations as varied as ancient china abortifacient knowledge is often attributed to the mythological ruler shennong ancient india since its vedic age ancient egypt with its ebers papyrus 1550 bce and the roman empire in the time of juvenal 200 ce one of the earliest known artistic representations of abortion is in a bas relief at angkor wat 1150 found in a series of friezes that represent judgment after death in hindu and buddhist culture it depicts the technique of abdominal abortion in judaism genesis the fetus is not considered to have a human soul until it is safely outside of the woman is viable and has taken its first breath the fetus is considered valuable property of the woman and not a human life while in the womb  while judaism encourages people to be fruitful and multiply by having children abortion is allowed and is deemed necessary when a pregnant womans life is in danger several religions including judaism which disagree that human life begins at conception support the legality of abortion on religious freedom grounds in islam abortion is traditionally permitted until a point in time when muslims believe the soul enters the fetus considered by various theologians to be at conception 40 days after conception 120 days after conception or quickening abortion is largely heavily restricted or forbidden in areas of high islamic faith such as the middle east and north africa some medical scholars and abortion opponents have suggested that the hippocratic oath forbade physicians in ancient greece from performing abortions other scholars disagree with this interpretation and state that the medical texts of hippocratic corpus contain descriptions of abortive techniques right alongside the oath the physician scribonius largus wrote in 43 ce that the hippocratic oath prohibits abortion as did soranus of ephesus although apparently not all doctors adhered to it strictly at the time according to soranus 1st or 2nd century ce work gynaecology one party of medical practitioners banished all abortives as required by the hippocratic oath the other party to which he belonged was willing to prescribe abortions only for the sake of the mothers health in politics 350 bce aristotle condemned infanticide as a means of population control he preferred abortion in such cases with the restriction that it must be practised on it before it has developed sensation and life for the line between lawful and unlawful abortion will be marked by the fact of having sensation and being alive in the catholic church opinion was divided on how serious abortion was in comparison with such acts as contraception oral sex and sex in marriage for pleasure rather than procreation155167 the catholic church did not begin vigorously opposing abortion until the 19th century as early as 100 ce the didache taught that abortion was sinful several historians argue that prior to the 19th century most catholic authors did not regard termination of pregnancy before quickening or ensoulment as an abortion among these authors were the doctors of the church such as st augustine st thomas aquinas and st alphonsus liguori in 1588 pope sixtus v reign 15851590 was the only pope before pope pius ix in his 1869 bull apostolicae sedis to institute a church policy labeling all abortion as homicide and condemning abortion regardless of the stage of pregnancy362364157158 sixtus vs pronouncement was reversed in 1591 by pope gregory xiv in the recodification of 1917 code of canon law apostolicae sedis was strengthened in part to remove a possible reading that excluded excommunication of the mother statements made in the catechism of the catholic church the codified summary of the churchs teachings considers abortion from the moment of conception as homicide and called for the end of legal abortion denominations that support abortion rights with some limits include the united methodist church episcopal church evangelical lutheran church in america and presbyterian church usa a 2014 guttmacher survey of abortion patients in the united states found that many reported a religious affiliation 24 were catholic while 30 were protestant a 1995 survey reported that catholic women are as likely as the general population to terminate a pregnancy protestants are less likely to do so and evangelical christians are the least likely to do so a 2019 pew research center study found that most christian denominations were against overturning roe v wade which in the united states legalized abortion at around 70 except white evangelicals at 35 abortion has been a fairly common practice and was not always illegal or controversial until the 19th century under common law including early english common law dating back to edward coke in 1648 abortion was generally permitted before quickening 1426 weeks after conception or between the fourth and sixth month and at womens discretion it was whether abortion was performed after quickening that determined if it was a crime in europe and north america abortion techniques advanced starting in the 17th century the conservatism of most in the medical profession with regards to sexual matters prevented the wide expansion of abortion techniques other medical practitioners in addition to some physicians advertised their services and they were not widely regulated until the 19th century when the practice sometimes called restellism was banned in both the united states and the united kingdom some 19thcentury physicians one of the most famous and consequential being american horatio storer argued for antiabortion laws on racist and misogynist as well as moral grounds church groups were also highly influential in antiabortion movements and religious groups more so since the 20th century some of the early antiabortion laws punished only the doctor or abortionist and while women could be criminally tried for a selfinduced abortion they were rarely prosecuted in general in the united states some argued that abortion was more dangerous than childbirth until about 1930 when incremental improvements in abortion procedures relative to childbirth made abortion safer in 1920 soviet russia became the first country to legalize abortion after lenin insisted that no woman be forced to give birth iceland 1935 and sweden 1938 would follow suit to legalize certain or all forms of abortion in nazi germany 1935 a law permitted abortions for those deemed hereditarily ill while women considered of german stock were specifically prohibited from having abortions beginning in the second half of the 20th century abortion was legalized in a greater number of countries in japan abortion was first legalized by the 1948 eugenics protection law meant to prevent the births of inferior humans 2022 due to japans continuing strongly patriarchal culture and traditional views on womens societal roles women who want an abortion must normally get written permission from their partner society and culture abortion debate induced abortion has long been the source of considerable debate ethical moral philosophical biological religious and legal issues surrounding abortion are related to value systems opinions of abortion may be about fetal rights governmental authority and womens rights in both public and private debate arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion or the justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion the world medical association declaration on therapeutic abortion notes circumstances bringing the interests of a mother into conflict with the interests of her unborn child create a dilemma and raise the question as to whether or not the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated abortion debates especially pertaining to abortion laws are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion including complete prohibition most often describe themselves as prolife while groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as prochoice modern abortion law current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse religious moral and cultural factors continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world the right to life the right to liberty the right to security of person and the right to reproductive health are major issues of human rights that sometimes constitute the basis for the existence or absence of abortion laws in jurisdictions where abortion is legal certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a legal abortion an abortion performed without the womans consent is considered feticide and is generally illegal these requirements usually depend on the age of the fetus often using a trimesterbased system to regulate the window of legality or as in the us on a doctors evaluation of the fetus viability some jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure prescribe the distribution of information on fetal development or require that parents be contacted if their minor daughter requests an abortion other jurisdictions may require that a woman obtain the consent of the fetus father before aborting the fetus that abortion providers inform women of health risks of the proceduresometimes including risks not supported by the medical literatureand that multiple medical authorities certify that the abortion is either medically or socially necessary many restrictions are waived in emergency situations china which has ended their onechild policy and now has a two child policy has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their population control strategy other jurisdictions ban abortion almost entirely many but not all of these allow legal abortions in a variety of circumstances these circumstances vary based on jurisdiction but may include whether the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest the fetus development is impaired the womans physical or mental wellbeing is endangered or socioeconomic considerations make childbirth a hardship in countries where abortion is banned entirely such as nicaragua medical authorities have recorded rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy as well as deaths due to doctors fears of prosecution if they treat other gynecological emergencies some countries such as bangladesh that nominally ban abortion may also support clinics that perform abortions under the guise of menstrual hygiene this is also a terminology in traditional medicine in places where abortion is illegal or carries heavy social stigma pregnant women may engage in medical tourism and travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancies women without the means to travel can resort to providers of illegal abortions or attempt to perform an abortion by themselves the organization women on waves has been providing education about medical abortions since 1999 the ngo created a mobile medical clinic inside a shipping container which then travels on rented ships to countries with restrictive abortion laws because the ships are registered in the netherlands dutch law prevails when the ship is in international waters while in port the organization provides free workshops and education while in international waters medical personnel are legally able to prescribe medical abortion drugs and counseling sexselective abortion sonography and amniocentesis allow parents to determine sex before childbirth the development of this technology has led to sexselective abortion or the termination of a fetus based on its sex the selective termination of a female fetus is most common sexselective abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries the preference for male children is reported in many areas of asia and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in taiwan south korea india and china this deviation from the standard birth rates of males and females occurs despite the fact that the country in question may have officially banned sexselective abortion or even sexscreening in china a historical preference for a male child has been exacerbated by the onechild policy which was enacted in 1979 many countries have taken legislative steps to reduce the incidence of sexselective abortion at the international conference on population and development in 1994 over 180 states agreed to eliminate all forms of discrimination against the girl child and the root causes of son preference conditions also condemned by a pace resolution in 2011 the world health organization and unicef along with other united nations agencies have found that measures to restrict access to abortion in an effort to reduce sexselective abortions have unintended negative consequences largely stemming from the fact that women may seek or be coerced into seeking unsafe extralegal abortions on the other hand measures to reduce gender inequality can reduce the prevalence of such abortions without attendant negative consequences antiabortion violence in a number of cases abortion providers and these facilities have been subjected to various forms of violence including murder attempted murder kidnapping stalking assault arson and bombing antiabortion violence is classified by both governmental and scholarly sources as terrorism in the us and canada over 8000 incidents of violence trespassing and death threats have been recorded by providers since 1977 including over 200 bombingsarsons and hundreds of assaults the majority of abortion opponents have not been involved in violent acts in the united states four physicians who performed abortions have been murdered david gunn 1993 john britton 1994 barnett slepian 1998 and george tiller 2009 also murdered in the us and australia have been other personnel at abortion clinics including receptionists and security guards such as james barrett shannon lowney lee ann nichols and robert sanderson woundings eg garson romalis and attempted murders have also taken place in the united states and canada hundreds of bombings arsons acid attacks invasions and incidents of vandalism against abortion providers have occurred notable perpetrators of antiabortion violence include eric robert rudolph scott roeder shelley shannon and paul jennings hill the first person to be executed in the united states for murdering an abortion provider legal protection of access to abortion has been brought into some countries where abortion is legal these laws typically seek to protect abortion clinics from obstruction vandalism picketing and other actions or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment far more common than physical violence is psychological pressure in 2003 chris danze organized antiabortion organizations throughout texas to prevent the construction of a planned parenthood facility in austin the organizations released the personal information online of those involved with construction sent them up to 1200 phone calls a day and contacted their churches some protestors record women entering clinics on camera other animalsnonhuman examples spontaneous abortion occurs in various animals for example in sheep it may be caused by stress or physical exertion such as crowding through doors or being chased by dogs in cows abortion may be caused by contagious disease such as brucellosis or campylobacter but can often be controlled by vaccination eating pine needles can also induce abortions in cows several plants including broomweed skunk cabbage poison hemlock and tree tobacco are known to cause fetal deformities and abortion in cattle4546 and in sheep and goats7780 in horses a fetus may be aborted or resorbed if it has lethal white syndrome congenital intestinal aganglionosis foal embryos that are homozygous for the dominant white gene ww are theorized to also be aborted or resorbed before birth in many species of sharks and rays stressinduced abortions occur frequently on capture viral infection can cause abortion in dogs cats can experience spontaneous abortion for many reasons including hormonal imbalance a combined abortion and spaying is performed on pregnant cats especially in trapneuterreturn programs to prevent unwanted kittens from being born female rodents may terminate a pregnancy when exposed to the smell of a male not responsible for the pregnancy known as the bruce effect abortion may also be induced in animals in the context of animal husbandry for example abortion may be induced in mares that have been mated improperly or that have been purchased by owners who did not realize the mares were pregnant or that are pregnant with twin foals feticide can occur in horses and zebras due to male harassment of pregnant mares or forced copulation although the frequency in the wild has been questioned male gray langur monkeys may attack females following male takeover causing miscarriage see also notes references bibliography

the intolerable acts in mid1774 a british attempt to disarm the americans and the resulting battles of lexington and concord in april 1775 ignited the war in june the second continental congress formalized patriot militias into the continental army and appointed washington its commanderinchief the british parliament declared the colonies to be in a state of rebellion in august 1775 the stakes of the war were formalized with passage of the lee resolution by the congress in philadelphia on july 2 1776 and the unanimous ratification of the declaration of independence two days later on july 4 1776 after a successful siege washingtons forces drove the british army out of boston in march 1776 and british commander in chief william howe responded by launching the new york and new jersey campaign howe captured new york city in november washington responded by clandestinely crossing the delaware river and winning small but significant victories at trenton and princeton which restored patriot confidence in the summer of 1777 as howe was poised to capture philadelphia the continental congress fled to baltimore in october 1777 a separate northern british force under the command of john burgoyne was forced to surrender at saratoga in an american victory that proved crucial in convincing france and spain that an independent united states was a viable possibility after saratoga france signed a commercial agreement with the rebels followed by a treaty of alliance in february 1778 in 1779 spain also allied with france against britain in the treaty of aranjuez though spain did not formally ally with the americans howes replacement henry clinton intended to take the war against the americans into the south despite some initial success british general cornwallis was besieged by a francoamerican force in yorktown in september and october 1781 cornwallis was forced to surrender in october the british wars with france and spain continued for another two years but fighting largely ceased in america in april 1782 the north ministry was replaced by a new british government which accepted american independence and began negotiating the treaty of paris ratified on september 3 1783 britain acknowledged the sovereignty and independence of the united states of america bringing the american revolutionary war to an end the treaties of versailles resolved britains conflicts with france and spain and forced great britain to cede tobago senegal and small territories in india to france and menorca west florida and east florida to spain prelude to revolution the french and indian war part of the wider global conflict known as the seven years war ended with the 1763 peace of paris which expelled france from britains possessions in new france acquisition of territories in atlantic canada and west florida inhabited largely by french or spanishspeaking catholics led british authorities to consolidate their hold by populating them with englishspeaking settlers preventing conflict between settlers and indian tribes west of the appalachian mountains also avoided the cost of an expensive military occupation the royal proclamation of 1763 was designed to achieve these aims by refocusing colonial expansion north into nova scotia and south into florida with the mississippi river as the dividing line between british and spanish possessions in america settlement was tightly restricted beyond the 1763 limits and claims west of this line including by virginia and massachusetts were rescinded despite the fact that each colony argued that their boundaries extended from the atlantic ocean to the pacific ocean the vast exchange of territory ultimately destabilized existing alliances and trade networks between settlers and indians in the west while it proved impossible to prevent encroachment beyond the proclamation line with the exception of virginia and others deprived of rights to western lands the colonial legislatures agreed on the boundaries but disagreed on where to set them many settlers resented the restrictions entirely and enforcement required permanent garrisons along the frontier which led to increasingly bitter disputes over who should pay for them taxation and legislation although directly administered by the crown acting through a local governor the colonies were largely governed by nativeborn property owners while external affairs were managed by london colonial militia were funded locally but with the ending of the french threat in 1763 the legislatures expected less taxation not more at the same time the huge debt incurred by the seven years war and demands from british taxpayers for cuts in government expenditure meant parliament expected the colonies to fund their own defense the 1763 to 1765 grenville ministry instructed the royal navy to cease trading smuggled goods and enforce customs duties levied in american ports the most important was the 1733 molasses act routinely ignored before 1763 it had a significant economic impact since 85 of new england rum exports were manufactured from imported molasses these measures were followed by the sugar act and stamp act which imposed additional taxes on the colonies to pay for defending the western frontier in july 1765 the whigs formed the first rockingham ministry which repealed the stamp act and reduced tax on foreign molasses to help the new england economy but reasserted parliamentary authority in the declaratory act however this did little to end the discontent in 1768 a riot started in boston when the authorities seized the sloop liberty on suspicion of smuggling tensions escalated further in march 1770 when british troops fired on rockthrowing civilians killing five in what became known as the boston massacre the massacre coincided with the partial repeal of the townshend acts by the torybased north ministry which came to power in january 1770 and remained in office until 1781 north insisted on retaining duty on tea to enshrine parliaments right to tax the colonies the amount was minor but ignored the fact it was that very principle americans found objectionable tensions escalated following the destruction of a customs vessel in the june 1772 gaspee affair then came to a head in 1773 a banking crisis led to the nearcollapse of the east india company which dominated the british economy to support it parliament passed the tea act giving it a trading monopoly in the thirteen colonies since most american tea was smuggled by the dutch the act was opposed by those who managed the illegal trade while being seen as yet another attempt to impose the principle of taxation by parliament in december 1773 a group called the sons of liberty disguised as mohawk natives dumped 342 crates of tea into the boston harbor an event later known as the boston tea party the british parliament responded by passing the socalled intolerable acts aimed specifically at massachusetts although many colonists and members of the whig opposition considered them a threat to liberty in general this led to increased sympathy for the patriot cause locally in the british parliament and in the london press break with the british crown throughout the 18th century the elected lower houses in the colonial legislatures gradually wrested power from their royal governors dominated by smaller landowners and merchants these assemblies now established adhoc provincial legislatures variously called congresses conventions and conferences effectively replacing royal control with the exception of georgia twelve colonies sent representatives to the first continental congress to agree on a unified response to the crisis many of the delegates feared that an allout boycott would result in war and sent a petition to the king calling for the repeal of the intolerable acts however after some debate on september 17 1774 congress endorsed the massachusetts suffolk resolves and on october 20 passed the continental association based on a draft prepared by the first virginia convention in august the association instituted economic sanctions and a full boycott of goods against britain while denying its authority over internal american affairs a faction led by james duane and future loyalist joseph galloway insisted congress recognize parliaments right to regulate colonial trade expecting concessions by the north administration congress authorized the extralegal committees and conventions of the colonial legislatures to enforce the boycott this succeeded in reducing british imports by 97 from 1774 to 1775 however on february 9 parliament declared massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion and instituted a blockade of the colony in july the restraining acts limited colonial trade with the british west indies and britain and barred new england ships from the newfoundland cod fisheries the increase in tension led to a scramble for control of militia stores which each assembly was legally obliged to maintain for defense on april 19 a british attempt to secure the concord arsenal culminated in the battles of lexington and concord which began the revolutionary war political reactions after the patriot victory at concord moderates in congress led by john dickinson drafted the olive branch petition offering to accept royal authority in return for george iii mediating in the dispute however since the petition was immediately followed by the declaration of the causes and necessity of taking up arms colonial secretary lord dartmouth viewed the offer as insincere he refused to present the petition to the king which was therefore rejected in early september although constitutionally correct since george could not oppose his own government it disappointed those americans who hoped he would mediate in the dispute while the hostility of his language annoyed even loyalist members of congress combined with the proclamation of rebellion issued on august 23 in response to the battle at bunker hill it ended hopes of a peaceful settlement backed by the whigs parliament initially rejected the imposition of coercive measures by 170 votes fearing an aggressive policy would simply drive the americans towards independence however by the end of 1774 the collapse of british authority meant both lord north and george iii were convinced war was inevitable after boston gage halted operations and awaited reinforcements the irish parliament approved the recruitment of new regiments while allowing catholics to enlist for the first time britain also signed a series of treaties with german states to supply additional troops within a year it had an army of over 32000 men in america the largest ever sent outside europe at the time the employment of german soldiers against people viewed as british citizens was opposed by many in parliament and by the colonial assemblies combined with the lack of activity by gage opposition to the use of foreign troops allowed the patriots to take control of the legislatures declaration of independence support for independence was boosted by thomas paines pamphlet common sense which was published on january 10 1776 and argued for american selfgovernment and was widely reprinted to draft the declaration of independence the second continental congress appointed the committee of five consisting of thomas jefferson john adams benjamin franklin roger sherman and robert livingston the declaration was written almost exclusively by jefferson who wrote it largely in isolation between june 11 and june 28 1776 in a threestory residence at 700 market street in philadelphia identifying inhabitants of the thirteen colonies as one people the declaration simultaneously dissolved political links with britain while including a long list of alleged violations of english rights committed by george iii this is also one of the foremost times that the colonies were referred to as united states rather than the more common united colonies on july 2 congress voted for independence and published the declaration on july 4 which george washington read to his troops in new york city on july 9 at this point the revolution ceased to be an internal dispute over trade and tax policies and had evolved into a civil war since each state represented in congress was engaged in a struggle with britain but also split between american patriots and american loyalists patriots generally supported independence from britain and a new national union in congress while loyalists remained faithful to british rule estimates of numbers vary one suggestion being the population as a whole was split evenly between committed patriots committed loyalists and those who were indifferent others calculate the split as 40 patriot 40 neutral 20 loyalist but with considerable regional variations at the onset of the war the second continental congress realized defeating britain required foreign alliances and intelligencegathering the committee of secret correspondence was formed for the sole purpose of corresponding with our friends in great britain and other parts of the world from 1775 to 1776 the committee shared information and built alliances through secret correspondence as well as employing secret agents in europe to gather intelligence conduct undercover operations analyze foreign publications and initiate patriot propaganda campaigns paine served as secretary while benjamin franklin and silas deane sent to france to recruit military engineers were instrumental in securing french aid in paris war breaks out the revolutionary war included two principal campaign theaters within the thirteen colonies and a smaller but strategically important third one west of the appalachian mountains fighting began in the northern theater and was at its most severe from 1775 to 1778 american patriots achieved several strategic victories in the south the americans defeated the british army at saratoga in october 1777 and the french seeing the possibility for an american patriot victory in the war formally entered the war as an american ally during 1778 washington prevented the british army from breaking out of new york city while militia under george rogers clark conquered western quebec supported by francophone settlers and their indian allies which became the northwest territory the war became a stalemate in the north in 1779 so the british initiated their southern strategy which aimed to mobilize loyalist support in the region and occupy american patriotcontrolled territory north to chesapeake bay the campaign was initially successful with the british capture of charleston being a major setback for southern patriots however a francoamerican force surrounded the british army at yorktown and their surrender in october 1781 effectively ended fighting in america early engagements on april 14 1775 sir thomas gage commanderinchief north america since 1763 and also governor of massachusetts from 1774 received orders to take action against the patriots he decided to destroy militia ordnance stored at concord massachusetts and capture john hancock and samuel adams who were considered the principal instigators of the rebellion the operation was to begin around midnight on april 19 in the hope of completing it before the american patriots could respond however paul revere learned of the plan and notified captain parker commander of the concord militia who prepared to resist the attempted seizure the first action of the war commonly referred to as the shot heard round the world was a brief skirmish at lexington followed by the fullscale battles of lexington and concord british troops suffered around 300 casualties before withdrawing to boston which was then besieged by the militia in may 1775 4500 british reinforcements arrived under generals william howe john burgoyne and sir henry clinton on june 17 they seized the charlestown peninsula at the battle of bunker hill a frontal assault in which they suffered over 1000 casualties dismayed at the costly attack which had gained them little gage appealed to london for a larger army to suppress the revolt but instead was replaced as commander by howe on june 14 1775 congress took control of american patriot forces outside boston and congressional leader john adams nominated washington as commanderinchief of the newly formed continental army washington previously commanded virginia militia regiments in the french and indian war and on june 16 hancock officially proclaimed him general and commander in chief of the army of the united colonies he assumed command on july 3 preferring to fortify dorchester heights outside boston rather than assaulting it in early march 1776 colonel henry knox arrived with heavy artillery acquired in the capture of fort ticonderoga under cover of darkness on march 5 washington placed these on dorchester heights from where they could fire on the town and british ships in boston harbor fearing another bunker hill howe evacuated the city on march 17 without further loss and sailed to halifax nova scotia while washington moved south to new york city beginning in august 1775 american privateers raided towns in nova scotia including saint john charlottetown and yarmouth in 1776 john paul jones and jonathan eddy attacked canso and fort cumberland respectively british officials in quebec began negotiating with the iroquois for their support while us envoys urged them to remain neutral aware of native american leanings toward the british and fearing an angloindian attack from canada congress authorized a second invasion in april 1775 after the defeat at the battle of quebec on december 31 the americans maintained a loose blockade of the city until they retreated on may 6 1776 a second defeat at troisrivières on june 8 ended operations in quebec british pursuit was initially blocked by american naval vessels on lake champlain until victory at valcour island on october 11 forced the americans to withdraw to fort ticonderoga while in december an uprising in nova scotia sponsored by massachusetts was defeated at fort cumberland these failures impacted public support for the patriot cause and aggressive antiloyalist policies in the new england colonies alienated the canadians in virginia an attempt by governor lord dunmore to seize militia stores on april 20 1775 led to an increase in tension although conflict was avoided for the time being this changed after the publication of dunmores proclamation on november 7 1775 promising freedom to any slaves who fled their patriot masters and agreed to fight for the crown british forces were defeated at great bridge on december 9 and took refuge on british ships anchored near the port of norfolk when the third virginia convention refused to disband its militia or accept martial law dunmore ordered the burning of norfolk on january 1 1776 the siege of savages old fields began on november 19 in south carolina between loyalist and patriot militias and the loyalists were subsequently driven out of the colony in the snow campaign loyalists were recruited in north carolina to reassert british rule in the south but they were decisively defeated in the battle of moores creek bridge a british expedition sent to reconquer south carolina launched an attack on charleston in the battle of sullivans island on june 28 1776 but it failed and left the south under patriot control until 1780 a shortage of gunpowder led congress to authorize a naval expedition against the bahamas to secure ordnance stored there on march 3 1776 an american squadron under the command of esek hopkins landed at the east end of nassau and encountered minimal resistance at fort montagu hopkins troops then marched on fort nassau hopkins had promised governor montfort browne and the civilian inhabitants of the area that their lives and property would not be in any danger if they offered no resistance to which they complied hopkins captured large stores of powder and other munitions that was so great he had to impress an extra ship in the harbor to transport the supplies back home when he departed on march 17 a month later after a brief skirmish with glasgow they returned to new london connecticut the base for american naval operations during the revolution british new york counteroffensive after regrouping at halifax in nova scotia howe was determined to take the fight to the americans he set sail for new york in june 1776 and began landing troops on staten island near the entrance to new york harbor on july 2 the americans rejected howes informal attempt to negotiate peace on july 30 washington knew that an attack on the city was imminent and realized that he needed advance information to deal with disciplined british regular troops on august 12 1776 patriot thomas knowlton was given orders to form an elite group for reconnaissance and secret missions knowltons rangers which included nathan hale became the armys first intelligence unit when washington was driven off long island he soon realized that he would need more than military might and amateur spies to defeat the british he was committed to professionalizing military intelligence with aid from benjamin tallmadge washington launched the sixman culper spy ring the efforts of washington and the culper spy ring substantially increased the effective allocation and deployment of continental regiments in the field throughout the war washington spent more than 10 percent of his total military funds on military intelligence operations washington split the continental army into positions on manhattan and across the east river in western long island on august 27 at the battle of long island howe outflanked washington and forced him back to brooklyn heights but he did not attempt to encircle washingtons forces through the night of august 28 knox bombarded the british knowing they were up against overwhelming odds washington ordered the assembly of a war council on august 29 all agreed to retreat to manhattan washington quickly had his troops assembled and ferried them across the east river to manhattan on flatbottomed freight boats without any losses in men or ordnance leaving general thomas mifflins regiments as a rearguard howe met with a delegation from the second continental congress at the september staten island peace conference but it failed to conclude peace largely because the british delegates only had the authority to offer pardons and could not recognize independence on september 15 howe seized control of new york city when the british landed at kips bay and unsuccessfully engaged the americans at the battle of harlem heights the following day on october 18 howe failed to encircle the americans at the battle of pells point and the americans withdrew howe declined to close with washingtons army on october 28 at the battle of white plains and instead attacked a hill that was of no strategic value washingtons retreat isolated his remaining forces and the british captured fort washington on november 16 the british victory there amounted to washingtons most disastrous defeat with the loss of 3000 prisoners the remaining american regiments on long island fell back four days later general henry clinton wanted to pursue washingtons disorganized army but he was first required to commit 6000 troops to capture newport rhode island to secure the loyalist port general charles cornwallis pursued washington but howe ordered him to halt leaving washington unmolested the outlook following the defeat at fort washington appeared bleak for the american cause the reduced continental army had dwindled to fewer than 5000 men and was reduced further when enlistments expired at the end of the year popular support wavered and morale declined on december 20 1776 the continental congress abandoned the revolutionary capital of philadelphia and moved to baltimore where it remained for over two months until february 27 1777 loyalist activity surged in the wake of the american defeat especially in new york state in london news of the victorious long island campaign was well received with festivities held in the capital public support reached a peak and king george iii awarded the order of the bath to howe strategic deficiencies among patriot forces were evident washington divided a numerically weaker army in the face of a stronger one his inexperienced staff misread the military situation and american troops fled in the face of enemy fire the successes led to predictions that the british could win within a year in the meantime the british established winter quarters in the new york city area and anticipated renewed campaigning the following spring patriot resurgence two weeks after congress withdrew to baltimore on the night of december 2526 1776 washington crossed the delaware river leading a column of continental army troops from todays bucks county pennsylvania located about 30 miles upriver from philadelphia to todays mercer county new jersey in a logistically challenging and dangerous operation meanwhile the hessians were involved in numerous clashes with small bands of patriots and were often aroused by false alarms at night in the weeks before the actual battle of trenton by christmas they were tired and weary while a heavy snowstorm led their commander colonel johann rall to assume no attack of any consequence would occur at daybreak on the 26th the american patriots surprised and overwhelmed rall and his troops who lost over 20 killed including rall while 900 prisoners german cannons and much supply were captured the battle of trenton restored the american armys morale reinvigorated the patriot cause and dispelled their fear of what they regarded as hessian mercenaries a british attempt to retake trenton was repulsed at assunpink creek on january 2 during the night washington outmaneuvered cornwallis then defeated his rearguard in the battle of princeton the following day the two victories helped convince the french that the americans were worthy military allies after his success at princeton washington entered winter quarters at morristown new jersey where he remained until may and received congressional direction to inoculate all patriot troops against smallpox with the exception of a minor skirmishing between the two armies which continued until march howe made no attempt to attack the americans british northern strategy fails the 1776 campaign demonstrated that regaining new england would be a prolonged affair which led to a change in british strategy this involved isolating the north from the rest of the country by taking control of the hudson river allowing them to focus on the south where loyalist support was believed to be substantial in december 1776 howe wrote to the colonial secretary lord germain proposing a limited offensive against philadelphia while a second force moved down the hudson from canada germain received this on february 23 1777 followed a few days later by a memorandum from burgoyne then in london on leave burgoyne supplied several alternatives all of which gave him responsibility for the offensive with howe remaining on the defensive the option selected required him to lead the main force south from montreal down the hudson valley while a detachment under barry st leger moved east from lake ontario the two would meet at albany leaving howe to decide whether to join them reasonable in principle this did not account for the logistical difficulties involved and burgoyne erroneously assumed howe would remain on the defensive germains failure to make this clear meant he opted to attack philadelphia instead burgoyne set out on june 14 1777 with a mixed force of british regulars professional german soldiers and canadian militia and captured fort ticonderoga on july 5 as general horatio gates retreated his troops blocked roads destroyed bridges dammed streams and stripped the area of food this slowed burgoynes progress and forced him to send out large foraging expeditions on one of these more than 700 british troops were captured at the battle of bennington on august 16 st leger moved east and besieged fort stanwix despite defeating an american relief force at the battle of oriskany on august 6 he was abandoned by his indian allies and withdrew to quebec on august 22 now isolated and outnumbered by gates burgoyne continued onto albany rather than retreating to fort ticonderoga reaching saratoga on september 13 he asked clinton for support while constructing defenses around the town morale among his troops rapidly declined and an unsuccessful attempt to break past gates at the battle of freeman farms on september 19 resulted in 600 british casualties when clinton advised he could not reach them burgoynes subordinates advised retreat a reconnaissance in force on october 7 was repulsed by gates at the battle of bemis heights forcing them back into saratoga with heavy losses by october 11 all hope of escape had vanished persistent rain reduced the camp to a squalid hell of mud and starving cattle supplies were dangerously low and many of the wounded in agony burgoyne capitulated on october 17 around 6222 soldiers including german forces commanded by general friedrich adolf riedesel surrendered their arms before being taken to boston where they were to be transported to england after securing additional supplies howe made another attempt on philadelphia by landing his troops in chesapeake bay on august 24 he now compounded failure to support burgoyne by missing repeated opportunities to destroy his opponent defeating washington at the battle of brandywine on september 11 then allowing him to withdraw in good order after dispersing an american detachment at paoli on september 20 cornwallis occupied philadelphia on september 26 with the main force of 9000 under howe based just to the north at germantown washington attacked them on october 4 but was repulsed to prevent howes forces in philadelphia being resupplied by sea the patriots erected fort mifflin and nearby fort mercer on the east and west banks of the delaware respectively and placed obstacles in the river south of the city this was supported by a small flotilla of continental navy ships on the delaware supplemented by the pennsylvania state navy commanded by john hazelwood an attempt by the royal navy to take the forts in the october 20 to 22 battle of red bank failed a second attack captured fort mifflin on november 16 while fort mercer was abandoned two days later when cornwallis breached the walls his supply lines secured howe tried to tempt washington into giving battle but after inconclusive skirmishing at the battle of white marsh from december 5 to 8 he withdrew to philadelphia for the winter on december 19 the americans followed suit and entered winter quarters at valley forge while washingtons domestic opponents contrasted his lack of battlefield success with gates victory at saratoga foreign observers such as frederick the great were equally impressed with germantown which demonstrated resilience and determination over the winter poor conditions supply problems and low morale resulted in 2000 deaths with another 3000 unfit for duty due to lack of shoes however baron friedrich wilhelm von steuben took the opportunity to introduce prussian army drill and infantry tactics to the entire continental army he did this by training model companies in each regiment who then instructed their home units despite valley forge being only twenty miles away howe made no effort to attack their camp an action some critics argue could have ended the war foreign intervention like his predecessors french foreign minister vergennes considered the 1763 peace a national humiliation and viewed the war as an opportunity to weaken britain he initially avoided open conflict but allowed american ships to take on cargoes in french ports a technical violation of neutrality although public opinion favored the american cause finance minister turgot argued they did not need french help to gain independence and war was too expensive instead vergennes persuaded louis xvi to secretly fund a government front company to purchase munitions for the patriots carried in neutral dutch ships and imported through sint eustatius in the caribbean many americans opposed a french alliance fearing to exchange one tyranny for another but this changed after a series of military setbacks in early 1776 as france had nothing to gain from the colonies reconciling with britain congress had three choices making peace on british terms continuing the struggle on their own or proclaiming independence guaranteed by france although the declaration of independence in july 1776 had wide public support adams was among those reluctant to pay the price of an alliance with france and over 20 of congressmen voted against it congress agreed to the treaty with reluctance and as the war moved in their favor increasingly lost interest in it silas deane was sent to paris to begin negotiations with vergennes whose key objectives were replacing britain as the united states primary commercial and military partner while securing the french west indies from american expansion these islands were extremely valuable in 1772 the value of sugar and coffee produced by saintdomingue on its own exceeded that of all american exports combined talks progressed slowly until october 1777 when british defeat at saratoga and their apparent willingness to negotiate peace convinced vergennes only a permanent alliance could prevent the disaster of angloamerican rapprochement assurances of formal french support allowed congress to reject the carlisle peace commission and insist on nothing short of complete independence on february 6 1778 france and the united states signed the treaty of amity and commerce regulating trade between the two countries followed by a defensive military alliance against britain the treaty of alliance in return for french guarantees of american independence congress undertook to defend their interests in the west indies while both sides agreed not to make a separate peace conflict over these provisions would lead to the 1798 to 1800 quasiwar charles iii of spain was invited to join on the same terms but refused largely due to concerns over the impact of the revolution on spanish colonies in the americas spain had complained on multiple occasions about encroachment by american settlers into louisiana a problem that could only get worse once the united states replaced britain although spain ultimately made important contributions to american success in the treaty of aranjuez charles agreed only to support frances war with britain outside america in return for help in recovering gibraltar menorca and spanish florida the terms were confidential since several conflicted with american aims for example the french claimed exclusive control of the newfoundland cod fisheries a nonnegotiable for colonies like massachusetts one less wellknown impact of this agreement was the abiding american distrust of foreign entanglements the us would not sign another treaty with france until their nato agreement of 1949 this was because the us had agreed not to make peace without france while aranjuez committed france to keep fighting until spain recovered gibraltar effectively making it a condition of us independence without the knowledge of congress to encourage french participation in the struggle for independence the us representative in paris silas deane promised promotion and command positions to any french officer who joined the continental army such as gilbert du motier marquis de lafayette whom congress via dean appointed a major general on july 31 1777 when the war started britain tried to borrow the dutchbased scots brigade for service in america but propatriot sentiment led the states general to refuse although the republic was no longer a major power prior to 1774 they still dominated the european carrying trade and dutch merchants made large profits shipping frenchsupplied munitions to the patriots this ended when britain declared war in december 1780 a conflict that proved disastrous to the dutch economy the dutch were also excluded from the first league of armed neutrality formed by russia sweden and denmark in march 1780 to protect neutral shipping from being stopped and searched for contraband by britain and france the british government failed to take into account the strength of the american merchant marine and support from european countries which allowed the colonies to import munitions and continue trading with relative impunity while well aware of this the north administration delayed placing the royal navy on a war footing for cost reasons this prevented the institution of an effective blockade and restricted them to ineffectual diplomatic protests traditional british policy was to employ european landbased allies to divert the opposition a role filled by prussia in the seven years war in 1778 they were diplomatically isolated and faced war on multiple fronts meanwhile george iii had given up on subduing america while britain had a european war to fight he did not welcome war with france but he believed the british victories over france in the seven years war as a reason to believe in ultimate victory over france britain could not find a powerful ally among the great powers to engage france on the european continent britain subsequently changed its focus into the caribbean theater and diverted major military resources away from america vergenness colleague stated for her honour france had to seize this opportunity to rise from her degradation  if she neglected it if fear overcame duty she would add debasement to humiliation and become an object of contempt to her own century and to all future peoples stalemate in the north at the end of 1777 howe resigned and was replaced by sir henry clinton on may 24 1778 with french entry into the war he was ordered to consolidate his forces in new york on june 18 the british departed philadelphia with the reinvigorated americans in pursuit the battle of monmouth on june 28 was inconclusive but boosted patriot morale washington had rallied charles lees broken regiments the continentals repulsed british bayonet charges the british rear guard lost perhaps 50 percent more casualties and the americans held the field at the end of the day that midnight the newly installed clinton continued his retreat to new york a french naval force under admiral charles henri hector destaing was sent to assist washington deciding new york was too formidable a target in august they launched a combined attack on newport with general john sullivan commanding land forces the resulting battle of rhode island was indecisive badly damaged by a storm the french withdrew to avoid putting their ships at risk further activity was limited to british raids on chestnut neck and little egg harbor in october in july 1779 the americans captured british positions at stony point and paulus hook clinton unsuccessfully tried to tempt washington into a decisive engagement by sending general william tryon to raid connecticut in july a large american naval operation the penobscot expedition attempted to retake maine then part of massachusetts but was defeated persistent iroquois raids along the border with quebec led to the punitive sullivan expedition in april 1779 destroying many settlements but failing to stop them during the winter of 17791780 the continental army suffered greater hardships than at valley forge morale was poor public support fell away in the long war the continental dollar was virtually worthless the army was plagued with supply problems desertion was common and mutinies occurred in the pennsylvania line and new jersey line regiments over the conditions in early 1780 in june 1780 clinton sent 6000 men under wilhelm von knyphausen to retake new jersey but they were halted by local militia at the battle of connecticut farms although the americans withdrew knyphausen felt he was not strong enough to engage washingtons main force and retreated a second attempt two weeks later ended in a british defeat at the battle of springfield effectively ending their ambitions in new jersey in july washington appointed benedict arnold commander of west point his attempt to betray the fort to the british failed due to incompetent planning and the plot was revealed when his british contact john andré was captured and later executed arnold escaped to new york and switched sides an action justified in a pamphlet addressed to the inhabitants of america the patriots condemned his betrayal while he found himself almost as unpopular with the british war in the south the southern strategy was developed by lord germain based on input from londonbased loyalists including joseph galloway they argued that it made no sense to fight the patriots in the north where they were strongest while the new england economy was reliant on trade with britain regardless of who governed it on the other hand duties on tobacco made the south far more profitable for britain while local support meant securing it required small numbers of regular troops victory would leave a truncated united states facing british possessions in the south canada to the north and ohio on their western border with the atlantic seaboard controlled by the royal navy congress would be forced to agree to terms however assumptions about the level of loyalist support proved wildly optimistic germain accordingly ordered augustine prévost the british commander in east florida to advance into georgia in december 1778 lieutenantcolonel archibald campbell an experienced officer taken prisoner earlier in the war before being exchanged for ethan allen captured savannah on december 29 1778 he recruited a loyalist militia of nearly 1100 many of whom allegedly joined only after campbell threatened to confiscate their property poor motivation and training made them unreliable troops as demonstrated in their defeat by patriot militia at the battle of kettle creek on february 14 1779 although this was offset by british victory at brier creek on march 3 in june 1779 prévost launched an abortive assault on charleston before retreating to savannah an operation notorious for widespread looting by british troops that enraged both loyalists and patriots in october a joint french and american operation under destaing and general benjamin lincoln failed to recapture savannah prévost was replaced by lord cornwallis who assumed responsibility for germains strategy he soon realized estimates of loyalist support were considerably overstated and he needed far larger numbers of regular forces reinforced by clinton cornwalliss troops captured charleston in may 1780 inflicting the most serious patriot defeat of the war over 5000 prisoners were taken and the continental army in the south effectively destroyed on may 29 lieutenantcolonel banastre tarletons mainly loyalist force routed a continental army force nearly three times its size under the command of colonel abraham buford at the battle of waxhaws the battle is controversial for allegations of a massacre which were later used as a recruiting tool by the patriots clinton returned to new york leaving cornwallis to oversee the south despite their success the two men left barely on speaking terms with dire consequences for the future conduct of the war the southern strategy depended on local support but this was undermined by a series of coercive measures previously captured patriots were sent home after swearing not to take up arms against the king they were now required to fight their former comrades while the confiscation of patriotowned plantations led formerly neutral grandees to side with them skirmishes at williamsons plantation cedar springs rocky mount and hanging rock signaled widespread resistance to the new oaths throughout south carolina in july 1780 congress appointed gates commander in the south he was defeated at the battle of camden on august 16 leaving cornwallis free to enter north carolina despite battlefield success the british could not control the countryside and patriot attacks continued before moving north cornwallis sent loyalist militia under major patrick ferguson to cover his left flank leaving their forces too far apart to provide mutual support in early october ferguson was defeated at the battle of kings mountain dispersing organized loyalist resistance in the region despite this cornwallis continued into north carolina hoping for loyalist support while washington replaced gates with general nathanael greene in december 1780 greene divided his army leading his main force southeast pursued by cornwallis a detachment was sent southwest under daniel morgan who defeated tarletons british legion at cowpens on january 17 1781 nearly eliminating it as a fighting force the patriots now held the initiative in the south with the exception of a raid on richmond led by benedict arnold in january 1781 greene led cornwallis on a series of countermarches around north carolina by early march the british were exhausted and short of supplies and greene felt strong enough to fight the battle of guilford court house on march 15 although victorious cornwallis suffered heavy casualties and retreated to wilmington north carolina seeking supplies and reinforcements the patriots now controlled most of the carolinas and georgia outside the coastal areas after a minor reversal at the battle of hobkirks hill they recaptured fort watson and fort motte on april 15 on june 6 brigadier general andrew pickens captured augusta leaving the british in georgia confined to charleston and savannah the assumption loyalists would do most of the fighting left the british short of troops and battlefield victories came at the cost of losses they could not replace despite halting greenes advance at the battle of eutaw springs on september 8 cornwallis withdrew to charleston with little to show for his campaign western campaign from the beginning of the war bernardo de gálvez the governor of spanish louisiana allowed the americans to import supplies and munitions into new orleans then ship them to pittsburgh this provided an alternative transportation route for the continental army bypassing the british blockade of the atlantic coast the trade was organized by oliver pollock a successful merchant in havana and new orleans who was appointed us commercial agent it also helped support the american campaign in the west in february 1778 an expedition of militia to destroy british military supplies in settlements along the cuyahoga river was halted by adverse weather later in the year a second campaign was undertaken to seize the illinois country from the british virginia militia canadien settlers and indian allies commanded by colonel george rogers clark captured kaskaskia on july 4 and then secured vincennes though vincennes was recaptured by quebec governor henry hamilton in early 1779 the virginians counterattacked in the siege of fort vincennes and took hamilton prisoner clark secured western british quebec as the american northwest territory in the treaty of paris brought the revolutionary war to an end when spain joined frances war against britain in the anglofrench war in 1779 their treaty specifically excluded spanish military action in north america later that year however gálvez initiated offensive operations against british outposts first he cleared british garrisons in baton rouge louisiana fort bute and natchez mississippi and captured five forts in doing so gálvez opened navigation on the mississippi river north to the american settlement in pittsburgh on may 25 1780 british colonel henry bird invaded kentucky as part of a wider operation to clear american resistance from quebec to the gulf coast their pensacola advance on new orleans was repelled by spanish governor gálvezs offensive on mobile simultaneous british attacks were repulsed on st louis by the spanish lieutenant governor de leyba and on the virginia county courthouse in cahokia illinois by lieutenant colonel clark the british initiative under bird from detroit was ended at the rumored approach of clark the scale of violence in the licking river valley was extreme even for frontier standards it led to english and german settlements who joined clarks militia when the british and their hired german soldiers withdrew to the great lakes the americans responded with a major offensive along the mad river in august which met with some success in the battle of piqua but did not end indian raids french soldier augustin de la balme led a canadian militia in an attempt to capture detroit but they dispersed when miami natives led by little turtle attacked the encamped settlers on november 5 the war in the west stalemated with the british garrison sitting in detroit and the virginians expanding westward settlements north of the ohio river in the face of britishallied indian resistance in 1781 galvez and pollock campaigned east along the gulf coast to secure west florida including britishheld mobile and pensacola the spanish operations impaired the british supply of armaments to british indian allies which effectively suspended a military alliance to attack settlers between the mississippi river and the appalachian mountains in 1782 large scale retaliations between settlers and native americans in the region included the gnadenhutten massacre and the crawford expedition the 1782 battle of blue licks was one of the last major engagements of the american revolutionary war news of the treaty between great britain and the united states arrived late that year by this time about 7 of kentucky settlers had been killed in battles against native americans contrasted with 1 of the population killed in the thirteen colonies lingering resentments led to continued fighting in the west after the war officially ended british defeat clinton spent most of 1781 based in new york city he failed to construct a coherent operational strategy partly due to his difficult relationship with admiral marriot arbuthnot in charleston cornwallis independently developed an aggressive plan for a campaign in virginia which he hoped would isolate greenes army in the carolinas and cause the collapse of patriot resistance in the south this strategy was approved by lord germain in london but neither of them informed clinton washington and rochambeau meanwhile discussed their options washington wanted to attack the british in new york and rochambeau wanted to attack them in virginia where cornwalliss forces were less established and arguably easier to defeat washington eventually gave way and lafayette took a combined francoamerican force into virginia but clinton misinterpreted his movements as preparations for an attack on new york concerned by a perceived threat to his positions in new york he instructed cornwallis to establish a fortified sea base where the royal navy could evacuate british troops to help defend new york when lafayette entered virginia cornwallis complied with clintons orders and withdrew to yorktown where he constructed strong defenses and awaited evacuation an agreement by the spanish navy to defend the french west indies allowed admiral françois joseph paul de grasse to relocate to the atlantic seaboard a move arbuthnot did not anticipate this provided lafayette naval support while the failure of previous combined operations at newport and savannah meant their coordination was planned more carefully despite repeated urging from his subordinates cornwallis made no attempt to engage lafayette before he could establish siege lines expecting to be withdrawn within a few days he also abandoned the outer defenses which were promptly occupied by the besiegers and hastened british defeat on august 31 a royal navy fleet under thomas graves left new york for yorktown after landing troops and munitions for the besiegers on august 30 de grasse remained in chesapeake bay and intercepted him on september 5 although the battle of the chesapeake was indecisive in terms of losses graves was forced to retreat leaving cornwallis isolated an attempted breakout over york river at gloucester point failed due to bad weather under heavy bombardment with dwindling supplies cornwallis felt his situation was hopeless and on october 16 sent emissaries to general washington to negotiate their surrender after twelve hours of negotiations the terms of surrender were finalized the following day responsibility for defeat was the subject of fierce public debate between cornwallis clinton and germain despite criticism from his junior officers cornwallis retained the confidence of his peers and later held a series of senior government positions clinton ultimately took most of the blame and spent the rest of his life in relative obscurity subsequent to yorktown american forces were assigned to supervise the armistice between washington and clinton made to facilitate british departure following the january 1782 law of parliament forbidding any further british offensive action in north america britishamerican negotiations in paris led to signed preliminary agreements in november 1782 which acknowledged us independence the enacted congressional war objective a british withdrawal from north america and cession of these regions to the us was completed in stages in east coast cities in the us south generals greene and wayne loosely invested the withdrawing british at savannah and charleston where they observed the british remove their troops from charleston on december 14 1782 loyalist provincial militias of whites and free blacks and loyalists with slaves were transported to nova scotia and the british west indies native american allies of the british and some freed blacks were left to escape unaided through the american lines washington moved his army to new windsor on the hudson river about sixty miles north of new york city and there the substance of the continental army was furloughed home with officers at half pay until the treaty of paris formally ended the war on september 3 1783 at that time congress decommissioned the regiments of washingtons continental army and began issuing land grants to veterans in the northwest territory for their war service the last british occupation of new york city ended on november 25 1783 with the departure of clintons replacement general sir guy carleton strategy and commanders to win their insurrection washington and the continental army needed to outlast the british will to continue the fight to restore their british america empire the british had to defeat the continental army in the early months and compel second continental congress in philadelphia to dissolve and retract its claim to selfgovernance historian terry m mays of the citadel identifies three separate types of warfare during the revolutionary war the first was a colonial conflict in which objections to imperial trade regulation were as significant as taxation policy the second was a civil war with all thirteen colonies split between american patriots american loyalists and those who preferred to remain neutral in the revolution and war particularly in the south many battles were fought between patriots and loyalists with no british involvement leading to divisions that continued after independence was achieved the third element was a global war between france spain the dutch republic and britain with america serving as one of several different war theaters after entering the revolutionary war in 1778 france provided the americans money weapons soldiers and naval assistance while french troops fought under us command in north america while spain did not formally join the war in america they provided access to the mississippi river and captured british possessions on the gulf of mexico that denied bases to the royal navy retook menorca and besieged gibraltar in europe although the dutch republic was no longer a major power prior to 1774 they still dominated the european carrying trade and dutch merchants made large profits by shipping frenchsupplied munitions to the patriots this ended when britain declared war in december 1780 and the conflict proved disastrous to the dutch economy the dutch were also excluded from the first league of armed neutrality formed by russia sweden and denmark in march 1780 that protected neutral ships from being stopped and searched for contraband by britain and france while of limited effect these interventions forced the british to divert men and resources away from north america american strategy the second continental congress meeting in philadelphia stood to benefit if the american revolution evolved into a protracted war their thirteen colonial state populations were largely prosperous and depended on local production for food and supplies rather than on imports from britain which took six to twelve weeks to arrive by crossatlantic shipping the thirteen colonies were spread across most of north american atlantic seaboard stretching 1000 miles most colonial farms were remote from the seaports and control of four or five major ports did not give britain control over american inland areas each state had established internal distribution systems each of the thirteen colonies also had a longestablished system of local militia which were combattested in support of british regulars thirteen years before to secure an expanded british empire together these militias denied frances claims to north america west of the mississippi river in the french and indian war the thirteen colonial state legislatures independently funded and controlled their local militias in the american revolution they trained and provided continental line regiments to the regular army each with their own state officer corps motivation was also a major asset each colonial capital had its own newspapers and printers and the patriots enjoyed more popular support than the loyalists britain hoped that the loyalists would do much of the fighting but found that the loyalists did not engage as significantly as they had hoped continental army when the revolutionary war began the second continental congress lacked a professional army or navy but each colony maintained local militias militiamen were lightly armed had little training and usually did not have uniforms their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time and lacked the training and discipline of more experienced soldiers local county militias were reluctant to travel far from home and they were unavailable for extended operations to compensate for this the continental congress established a regular force known as the continental army on june 14 1775 which proved to be the origin of the modern united states army and appointed washington as its commanderinchief however it suffered significantly from the lack of an effective training program and from largely inexperienced officers and sergeants offset by a few senior officers each state legislature appointed officers for both county and state militias and their regimental continental line officers although washington was required to accept congressional appointments he was still permitted to choose and command his own generals such as greene his chief of artillery knox and alexander hamilton the chief of staff one of washingtons most successful general officer recruits was steuben a veteran of the prussian general staff who wrote the revolutionary war drill manual the development of the continental army was always a work in progress and washington used both his regulars and state militias throughout the war when properly employed the combination allowed them to overwhelm smaller british forces as they did in battles at concord boston bennington and saratoga both sides used partisan warfare but the state militias effectively suppressed loyalist activity when british regulars were not in the area washington designed the overall military strategy of the revolutionary war in cooperation with congress established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs personally recruited his senior officer corps and kept the states focused on a common goal for the first three years until after fall of philadelphia and the sixmonth encampment at valley forge the continental army was largely supplemented by local state militias washington initially employed the inexperienced officers and untrained troops in fabian strategies rather than risk frontal assaults against britains professional soldiers and officers over the course of the entire war washington lost more battles than he won but he never surrendered his troops and maintained a fighting force in the face of british field armies and never gave up fighting for the american cause by prevailing european standards the armies in america were relatively small limited by lack of supplies and logistics the british were constrained by the logistical difficulty of transporting troops across the atlantic and their dependence on local supplies throughout the war washington never directly commanded more than 17000 men and the combined francoamerican army in the decisive american victory at yorktown was only about 19000 at the beginning of 1776 patriot forces consisted of 20000 men with twothirds of them in the continental army and the other third in the various state militias about 250000 american men served as regulars or as militia for the revolutionary cause over eight years during wartime but there were never more than 90000 men under arms at any time on the whole american officers never equaled their british opponents in tactics and maneuvers and they lost most of the pitched battles the great successes at boston 1776 saratoga 1777 and yorktown 1781 were won by trapping the british far from base with a greater number of troops after 1778 however washingtons army was transformed into a more disciplined and effective force mostly as a product of baron von steubens military training immediately after the continental army emerged from valley forge in june 1778 it proved its ability to match the military capabilities of the british at the battle of monmouth including a black rhode island regiment fending off a british bayonet attack and then counter charging the british for the first time as part of washingtons army after the battle of monmouth washington came to realize that saving entire towns was not necessary but preserving his army and keeping the revolutionary spirit alive was more important washington informed henry laurens then president of the second continental congress that the possession of our towns while we have an army in the field will avail them little although the continental congress was responsible for the war effort and provided supplies to the troops washington took it upon himself to pressure congress and the state legislatures to provide the essentials of war there was never nearly enough congress evolved in its committee oversight and established the board of war which included members of the military because the board of war was also a committee ensnared with its own internal procedures congress also created the post of secretary of war appointing major general benjamin lincoln to the position in february 1781 washington worked closely with lincoln to coordinate civilian and military authorities and took charge of training and supplying the army continental navy during the first summer of the war washington began outfitting schooners and other small seagoing vessels to prey on ships supplying the british in boston the second continental congress established the continental navy on october 13 1775 and appointed esek hopkins as its first commander for most of the war the continental navy included only a handful of small frigates and sloops supported by numerous privateers on november 10 1775 congress authorized the creation of the continental marines which ultimately evolved into and was named the united states marine corps john paul jones became the first american naval hero when he captured hms drake on april 24 1778 the first victory for any american military vessel in british waters the last such victory was by the frigate uss alliance commanded by captain john barry on march 10 1783 the alliance outgunned hms sybil in a 45minute duel while escorting spanish gold from havana to the congress in philadelphia after yorktown all us navy ships were sold or given away it was the first time in americas history that it had no fighting forces on the high seas congress primarily commissioned privateers to reduce costs and to take advantage of the large proportion of colonial sailors found in the british empire in total they included 1700 ships that successfully captured 2283 enemy ships to damage the british effort and to enrich themselves with the proceeds from the sale of cargo and the ship itself about 55000 sailors served aboard american privateers during the war france at the beginning of the revolutionary war the americans had no major international allies since most nationstates watched and waited to see how developments unfolded in the conflict in british america over time the continental army established its military credibility defeating or holding their own against british regulars and their hired hessians known to all european great powers battles such as the battle of bennington the battles of saratoga and even defeats such as the battle of germantown proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful european nations including france spain and the dutch republic the dutch impressed by these american victories and conflicts moved from covertly supplying the americans with weapons and supplies to overtly supporting them the decisive american victory at saratoga convinced france which was already a longtime rival of britain to offer the americans the treaty of amity and commerce the two nations also agreed to a defensive treaty of alliance to protect their trade and also guaranteed american independence from britain to engage the united states as a french ally militarily the treaty was conditioned on britain initiating a war on france to stop it from trading with the us spain and the dutch republic were invited to join by both france and the united states in the treaty but neither was responsive to the request on june 13 1778 france declared war on great britain and it invoked the french military alliance with the us which ensured additional us private support for french possessions in the caribbean washington worked closely with the soldiers and navy that france would send to america primarily through lafayette on his staff french assistance made critical contributions required to defeat cornwallis at yorktown in 1781 british strategy the british military had considerable experience of fighting in north america most recently during the seven years war which forced france to give up new france in 1763 however in previous conflicts they benefited from local logistics as well as support from the colonial militia which was not available in the american revolutionary war reinforcements had to come from europe and maintaining large armies over such distances was extremely complex ships could take three months to cross the atlantic and orders from london were often outdated by the time they arrived prior to the conflict the colonies were largely autonomous economic and political entities with no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance this meant that unlike europe where the fall of a capital city often ended wars that in america continued even after the loss of major settlements such as philadelphia the seat of congress new york and charleston british power was reliant on the royal navy whose dominance allowed them to resupply their own expeditionary forces while preventing access to enemy ports however the majority of the american population was agrarian rather than urban supported by the french navy and blockade runners based in the dutch caribbean their economy was able to survive the geographical size of the colonies and limited manpower meant the british could not simultaneously conduct military operations and occupy territory without local support debate persists over whether their defeat was inevitable one british statesman described it as like trying to conquer a map while ferling argues patriot victory was nothing short of a miracle ellis suggests the odds always favored the americans especially after howe squandered the chance of a decisive british success in 1776 an opportunity that would never come again the us military history speculates the additional commitment of 10000 fresh troops in 1780 would have placed british victory within the realm of possibility british army the expulsion of france from north america in 1763 led to a drastic reduction in british troop levels in the colonies in 1775 there were only 8500 regular soldiers among a civilian population of 28 million the bulk of military resources in the americas were focused on defending sugar islands in the caribbean jamaica alone generated more revenue than all thirteen american colonies combined with the end of the seven years war the permanent army in britain was also cut back which resulted in administrative difficulties when the war began a decade later over the course of the war there were four separate british commandersinchief the first was thomas gage appointed in 1763 whose initial focus was establishing british rule in former french areas of canada rightly or wrongly many in london blamed the revolt on his failure to take firm action earlier and he was relieved after the heavy losses incurred at the battle of bunker hill in charlestown massachusetts his replacement was sir william howe a member of the whig faction in parliament who opposed the policy of coercion advocated by lord north cornwallis who later surrendered at yorktown was one of many senior officers who initially refused to serve in north america the 1775 campaign showed the british overestimated the capabilities of their own troops and underestimated the colonial militia requiring a reassessment of tactics and strategy however it allowed the patriots to take the initiative and british authorities rapidly lost control over every colony howes responsibility is still debated despite receiving large numbers of reinforcements bunker hill seems to have permanently affected his selfconfidence and lack of tactical flexibility meant he often failed to follow up opportunities many of his decisions were attributed to supply problems such as the delay in launching the new york campaign and failure to pursue washingtons beaten army having lost the confidence of his subordinates he was recalled after burgoyne surrendered at saratoga following the failure of the carlisle commission british policy changed from treating the patriots as subjects who needed to be reconciled to enemies who had to be defeated in 1778 howe was replaced by sir henry clinton appointed instead of carleton who was considered overly cautious regarded as an expert on tactics and strategy like his predecessors clinton was handicapped by chronic supply issues as a result he was largely inactive in 1779 and much of 1780 in october 1780 he warned germain of fatal consequences if matters did not improve in addition clintons strategy was compromised by conflict with political superiors in london and his colleagues in north america especially admiral mariot arbuthnot replaced in early 1781 by rodney he was neither notified nor consulted when germain approved cornwalliss invasion of the south in 1781 and delayed sending him reinforcements believing the bulk of washingtons army was still outside new york city after the surrender at yorktown clinton was relieved by carleton whose major task was to oversee the evacuation of loyalists and british troops from savannah charleston and new york city german troops during the 18th century states commonly hired foreign soldiers including britain during the seven years war foreign soldiers comprised 10 of the british army and their use caused little debate when it became clear additional troops were needed to suppress the revolt in america it was decided to employ professional german soldiers there were several reasons for this including public sympathy for the patriot cause an historical reluctance to expand the british army and the time needed to recruit and train new regiments an alternate source was readily available in the holy roman empire where many smaller states had a long tradition of renting their armies to the highest bidder the most important was hessekassel known as the mercenary state the first supply agreements were signed by the north administration in late 1775 over the next decade more than 40000 germans fought in north america gibraltar south africa and india of whom 30000 served in the american war often generically referred to as hessians they included men from many other states including hanover and brunswick sir henry clinton recommended recruiting russian troops whom he rated very highly having seen them in action against the ottomans however negotiations with catherine the great made little progress unlike previous wars their use led to intense political debate in britain france and even germany where frederick the great refused to provide passage through his territories for troops hired for the american war in march 1776 the agreements were challenged in parliament by whigs who objected to coercion in general and the use of foreign soldiers to subdue british subjects the debates were covered in detail by american newspapers which reprinted key speeches and in may 1776 they received copies of the treaties themselves provided by british sympathizers these were smuggled into north america from london by george merchant a recently released american prisoner the prospect of foreign german soldiers being used in the colonies bolstered support for independence more so than taxation and other acts combined the king was accused of declaring war on his own subjects leading to the idea there were now two separate governments by apparently showing britain was determined to go to war it made hopes of reconciliation seem naive and hopeless while the employment of what was regarded as foreign mercenaries became one of the charges levelled against george iii in the declaration of independence the hessian reputation within germany for brutality also increased support for the patriot cause among german american immigrants the presence of over 150000 german americans meant both sides felt the german soldiers might be persuaded to desert one reason clinton suggested employing russians was that he felt they were less likely to defect when the first german troops arrived on staten island in august 1776 congress approved the printing of handbills promising land and citizenship to any willing to join the patriot cause the british launched a countercampaign claiming deserters could well be executed for meddling in a war that was not theirs desertion among the germans occurred throughout the war with the highest rate of desertion occurring during the time between the surrender at yorktown and the treaty of paris german regiments were central to the british war effort of the estimated 30000 sent to america some 13000 became casualties revolution as civil war loyalists wealthy loyalists convinced the british government that most of the colonists were sympathetic toward the crown consequently british military planners relied on recruiting loyalists but had trouble recruiting sufficient numbers as the patriots had widespread support nevertheless they continued to deceive themselves on their level of american support as late as 1780 a year before hostilities ended approximately 25000 loyalists fought for the british throughout the war although loyalists constituted about twenty percent of the colonial population they were concentrated in distinct communities many of them lived among large plantation owners in the tidewater region and south carolina who produced cash crops in tobacco and indigo comparable to global markets in caribbean sugar when the british began probing the backcountry in 17771778 they were faced with a major problem any significant level of organized loyalist activity required a continued presence of british regulars the available manpower that the british had in america was insufficient to protect loyalist territory and counter american offensives the loyalist militias in the south were constantly defeated by neighboring patriot militia the most critical combat between the two partisan militias was at the battle of kings mountain the patriot victory irreversibly impaired any further loyalist militia capability in the south when the early war policy was administered by howe the crowns need to maintain loyalist support prevented it from using the traditional revolt suppression methods the british cause suffered when their troops ransacked local homes during an aborted attack on charleston in 1779 that enraged both patriots and loyalists after congress rejected the carlisle peace commission in 1778 and westminster turned to hard war during clintons command neutral colonists in the carolinas often allied with the patriots whenever brutal combat broke out between tories and whigs conversely loyalists gained support when patriots intimidated suspected tories by destroying property or tarring and feathering a loyalist militia unitthe british legionprovided some of the best troops in british service it received a commission in the british army it was a mixed regiment of 250 dragoons and 200 infantry supported by batteries of flying artillery it was commanded by tarleton and gained a fearsome reputation in the colonies for brutality and needless slaughtersee talk the green dragoonin may 1779 the british legion was one of five regiments that formed the american establishment women women played various roles during the revolutionary war they often accompanied their husbands when permitted to do so for example throughout the war martha washington was known to visit and provide aid to her husband george at various american camps and frederika charlotte riedesel documented the saratoga campaign women often accompanied armies as camp followers to sell goods and perform necessary tasks in hospitals and camps they were a necessary part of eighteenthcentury armies and numbered in the thousands during the war women also assumed military roles aside from military tasks like treating the wounded or setting up camp some dressed as men to directly support combat fight or act as spies on both sides of the revolutionary war anna maria lane joined her husband in the army and wore mens clothes by the time the battle of germantown happened the virginia general assembly later cited her bravery she fought while dressed as a man and performed extraordinary military services and received a severe wound at the battle of germantown  with the courage of a soldier on april 26 1777 sybil ludington is said to have ridden to alert militia forces of putnam county new york and danbury connecticut to warn them of the britishs approach she has been called the female paul revere a report in the new england quarterly says there is little evidence backing the story and whether the ride occurred is questioned a few others disguised themselves as men deborah sampson fought until her gender was discovered and discharged as a result sally st clair was killed in action during the war african americans when war began the population of the thirteen colonies included an estimated 500000 slaves predominantly used as labor on southern plantations in november 1775 lord dunmore the royal governor of virginia issued a proclamation that promised freedom to any patriotowned slaves willing to bear arms although the announcement helped to fill a temporary manpower shortage white loyalist prejudice meant recruits were eventually redirected to noncombatant roles the loyalists motive was to deprive patriot planters of labor rather than to end slavery loyalistowned slaves were returned the 1779 philipsburg proclamation issued by clinton extended the offer of freedom to patriotowned slaves throughout the colonies it persuaded entire families to escape to british lines many of which were employed on farms to grow food for the army by removing the requirement for military service while clinton organized the black pioneers he also ensured fugitive slaves were returned to loyalist owners with orders that they were not to be punished for their attempted escape as the war progressed service as regular soldiers in british units became increasingly common black loyalists formed two regiments of the charleston garrison in 1783 estimates of the numbers who served the british during the war vary from 25000 to 50000 excluding those who escaped during wartime thomas jefferson estimated that virginia may have lost 30000 slaves in total escapes in south carolina nearly 25000 slaves about 30 percent of the enslaved population either fled migrated or died which significantly disrupted the plantation economies both during and after the war black patriots were barred from the continental army until washington convinced congress in january 1778 that there was no other way to replace losses from disease and desertion the 1st rhode island regiment formed in february included former slaves whose owners were compensated however only 140 of its 225 soldiers were black and recruitment stopped in june 1788 ultimately around 5000 african americans served in the continental army and navy in a variety of roles while another 4000 were employed in patriot militia units aboard privateers or as teamsters servants and spies after the war a small minority received land grants or congressional pensions in old age many others were returned to their masters postwar despite earlier promises of freedom as a patriot victory became increasingly likely the treatment of black loyalists became a point of contention after the surrender of yorktown in 1781 washington insisted all escapees be returned but cornwallis refused in 1782 and 1783 around 8000 to 10000 freed blacks were evacuated by the british from charleston savannah and new york some moved onto london while 3000 to 4000 settled in nova scotia where they founded settlements such as birchtown white loyalists transported 15000 enslaved blacks to jamaica and the bahamas the free black loyalists who migrated to the british west indies included regular soldiers from dunmores ethiopian regiment and those from charleston who helped garrison the leeward islands native americans most native americans east of the mississippi river were affected by the war and many tribes were divided over how to respond to the conflict a few tribes were friendly with the colonists but most natives opposed the union of the colonies as a potential threat to their territory approximately 13000 natives fought on the british side with the largest group coming from the iroquois tribes who deployed around 1500 men early in july 1776 cherokee allies of britain attacked the shortlived washington district of north carolina their defeat splintered both cherokee settlements and people and was directly responsible for the rise of the chickamauga cherokee who perpetuated the cherokeeamerican wars against american settlers for decades after hostilities with britain ended muscogee and seminole allies of britain fought against americans in georgia and south carolina in 1778 a force of 800 muscogee destroyed american settlements along the broad river in georgia muscogee warriors also joined thomas browns raids into south carolina and assisted britain during the siege of savannah many native americans were involved in the fight between britain and spain on the gulf coast and along the british side of the mississippi river thousands of muscogee chickasaw and choctaw fought in major battles such as the battle of fort charlotte the battle of mobile and the siege of pensacola the iroquois confederacy was shattered as a result of the american revolutionary war whatever side they took the seneca onondaga and cayuga tribes sided with the british members of the mohawks fought on both sides and many tuscarora and oneida sided with the americans to retaliate against raids on american settlement by loyalists and their indian allies the continental army dispatched the sullivan expedition on a punitive expedition throughout new york to debilitate the iroquois tribes that had sided with the british mohawk leaders joseph louis cook and joseph brant sided with the americans and the british respectively which further exacerbated the split in the western theater of the american revolutionary war conflicts between settlers and native americans led to lingering distrust in the 1783 treaty of paris great britain ceded control of the disputed lands between the great lakes and the ohio river but the indian inhabitants were not a part of the peace negotiations tribes in the northwest territory joined as the western confederacy and allied with the british to resist american settlement and their conflict continued after the revolutionary war as the northwest indian war britains american war and peace changing prime ministers lord north prime minister since 1770 delegated control of the war in north america to lord george germain and the earl of sandwich who was head of the royal navy from 1771 to 1782 defeat at saratoga in 1777 made it clear the revolt would not be easily suppressed especially after the francoamerican alliance of february 1778 and french declaration of war in june with spain also expected to join the conflict the royal navy needed to prioritize either the war in america or in europe germain advocated the former sandwich the latter british negotiators now proposed a second peace settlement to congress the terms presented by the carlisle peace commission included acceptance of the principle of selfgovernment parliament would recognize congress as the governing body suspend any objectionable legislation surrender its right to local colonial taxation and discuss including american representatives in the house of commons in return all property confiscated from loyalists would be returned british debts honored and locally enforced martial law accepted however congress demanded either immediate recognition of independence or the withdrawal of all british troops they knew the commission were not authorized to accept these bringing negotiations to a rapid end when the commissioners returned to london in november 1778 they recommended a change in policy sir henry clinton the new british commanderinchief in america was ordered to stop treating the rebels as enemies rather than subjects whose loyalty might be regained those standing orders would be in effect for three years until clinton was relieved north initially backed the southern strategy attempting to exploit divisions between the mercantile north and slaveowning south but after the defeat of yorktown he was forced to accept the fact that this policy had failed it was clear the war was lost although the royal navy forced the french to relocate their fleet to the caribbean in november 1781 and resumed a close blockade of american trade the resulting economic damage and rising inflation meant the us was now eager to end the war while france was unable to provide further loans congress could no longer pay its soldiers on february 27 1782 a whig motion to end the offensive war in america was carried by 19 votes north now resigned obliging the king to invite lord rockingham to form a government a consistent supporter of the patriot cause he made a commitment to us independence a condition of doing so george iii reluctantly accepted and the new government took office on march 27 1782 however rockingham died unexpectedly on july 1 and was replaced by lord shelburne who acknowledged american independence american congress signs a peace when lord rockingham the whig leader and friend of the american cause was elevated to prime minister congress consolidated its diplomatic consuls in europe into a peace delegation at paris all were experienced in congressional leadership the dean of the delegation was franklin of pennsylvania he had become a celebrity in the french court but he was also an enlightenment scientist with influence in the courts of european great powers in prussia englands former ally and austria a catholic empire like spain since the 1760s franklin had been an organizer of british american intercolony cooperation and then served as a colonial lobbyist to parliament in london john adams of massachusetts had been consul to the dutch republic and was a prominent early new england patriot john jay of new york had been consul to spain and was a past president of the continental congress as consul to the dutch republic henry laurens of south carolina had secured a preliminary agreement for a trade agreement he had been a successor to john jay as president of congress and with franklin was a member of the american philosophical society although active in the preliminaries he was not a signer of the conclusive treaty the whig negotiators for lord rockingham and his successor prime minister lord shelburne included longtime friend of benjamin franklin from his time in london david hartley and richard oswald who had negotiated laurens release from the tower of london the preliminary peace signed on november 30 met four key congressional demands independence territory up to the mississippi navigation rights into the gulf of mexico and fishing rights in newfoundland british strategy was to strengthen the us sufficiently to prevent france from regaining a foothold in north america and they had little interest in these proposals however divisions between their opponents allowed them to negotiate separately with each to improve their overall position starting with the american delegation in september 1782 the french and spanish sought to improve their position by creating the us dependent on them for support against britain thus reversing the losses of 1763 both parties tried to negotiate a settlement with britain excluding the americans france proposed setting the western boundary of the us along the appalachians matching the british 1763 proclamation line the spanish suggested additional concessions in the vital mississippi river basin but required the cession of georgia in violation of the francoamerican alliance facing difficulties with spain over claims involving the mississippi river and from france who was still reluctant to agree to american independence until all her demands were met john jay promptly told the british that he was willing to negotiate directly with them cutting off france and spain and prime minister lord shelburne in charge of the british negotiations agreed key agreements for the united states in obtaining peace included recognition of united states independence including recognition that the us would gain all of the area east of the mississippi river north of florida and south of canada and the granting of fishing rights in the grand banks off the coast of newfoundland and in the gulf of saint lawrence the united states and great britain were each given perpetual access to the mississippi river an angloamerican preliminary peace was formally entered into in november 1782 and congress endorsed the settlement on april 15 1783 it announced the achievement of peace with independence and the conclusive treaty was signed on september 2 1783 in paris effective the following day on september 3 1783 when britain signed its treaty with france john adams who helped draft the treaty claimed it represented one of the most important political events that ever happened on the globe ratified respectively by congress and parliament the final versions were exchanged in paris the following spring on november 25 the last british troops remaining in the us were evacuated from new york to halifax aftermath washington expressed astonishment that the americans had won a war against a leading world power referring to the american victory as little short of a standing miracle the conflict between british subjects with the crown against those with the congress had lasted over eight years from 1775 to 1783 the last uniformed british troops departed their last east coast port cities in savannah charleston and new york city by november 25 1783 which marked the end of british occupation in the new united states on april 9 1783 washington issued orders that he had long waited to give that all acts of hostility were to cease immediately that same day by arrangement with washington carleton issued a similar order to british troops british troops however were not to evacuate until a prisoner of war exchange occurred an effort that involved much negotiation and would take some seven months to effect as directed by a congressional resolution of may 26 1783 all noncommissioned officers and enlisted were furloughed to their homes until the definitive treaty of peace when they would be automatically discharged the us armies were directly disbanded in the field as of washingtons general orders on monday june 2 1783 once the treaty of paris was signed with britain on september 3 1783 washington resigned as commanderinchief of the continental army and left to retire at mount vernon territory the expanse of territory that was now the us was ceded from its colonial mother country alone it included millions of sparsely settled acres south of the great lakes line between the appalachian mountains and the mississippi river much of which was part of canada the tentative colonial migration west became a flood during the years of the revolutionary war kentucky county virginia for instance had a 1775 population of 150 by 1790 15 years later its population had grown to over 73000 britains extended postwar policy for the us continued to try to establish an indian barrier state below the great lakes as late as 1814 during the war of 1812 the formally acquired western american lands continued to be populated by a dozen or so american indian tribes that had been british allies for the most part though british forts on their lands had been ceded to either the french or the british prior to the creation of the us natives were not referred to in the british cession to the us while tribes were not consulted by the british for the treaty in practice the british refused to abandon the forts on territory they formally transferred instead they provisioned military allies for continuing frontier raids and sponsored the northwest indian war 17851795 including erecting an additional british fort miami in maumee ohio british sponsorship of local warfare on the us continued until the angloamerican jay treaty authored by hamilton went into effect on february 29 1796 at the same time the spanish also sponsored war within the us by indian proxies in its southwest territory ceded by france to britain then britain to the americans of the european powers with american colonies adjacent to the newly created us spain was most threatened by american independence and it was correspondingly the most hostile to it its territory adjacent to the us was relatively undefended so spanish policy developed a combination of initiatives spanish soft power diplomatically challenged the british territorial cession west to the mississippi river and the previous northern boundaries of spanish florida it imposed a high tariff on american goods then blocked american settler access to the port of new orleans spanish hard power extended war alliances and arms to southwestern natives to resist american settlement a former continental army general james wilkinson settled in kentucky county virginia in 1784 and there he fostered settler secession from virginia during the conflict with the spanishallied chickamauga cherokee beginning in 1787 he received pay as spanish agent 13 and subsequently expanded his efforts to persuade american settlers west of the appalachian mountains to secede from the united states first in the washington administration and later again in the jefferson administration casualties and losses the total loss of life throughout the conflict is largely unknown as was typical in wars of the era diseases such as smallpox claimed more lives than battle between 1775 and 1782 a smallpox epidemic broke out throughout north america killing an estimated 130000 among all its populations during those years historian joseph ellis suggests that washingtons decision to have his troops inoculated against the disease was one of his most important decisions up to 70000 american patriots died during active military service of these approximately 6800 were killed in battle while at least 17000 died from disease the majority of the latter died while prisoners of war of the british mostly in the prison ships in new york harbor the number of patriots seriously wounded or disabled by the war has been estimated from 8500 to 25000 the french suffered 2112 killed in combat in the united states the spanish lost a total of 124 killed and 247 wounded in west florida a british report in 1781 puts their total army deaths at 6046 in north america 17751779 approximately 7774 germans died in british service in addition to 4888 deserters among those labeled german deserters however it is estimated that 1800 were killed in combat legacy the american revolution established the united states with its numerous civil liberties and set an example to overthrow both monarchy and colonial governments the united states has the worlds oldest written constitution and the constitutions of other free countries often bear a striking resemblance to the us constitution often wordforword in places it inspired revolutions in france haiti latin america and elsewhere in the modern era although the revolution eliminated many forms of inequality it did little to change the status of women despite the role they played in winning independence most significantly it failed to end slavery which continued to be a serious social and political issue and caused divisions that would ultimately end in civil war while many were uneasy over the contradiction of demanding liberty for some yet denying it to others the dependence of southern states on slave labor made abolition too great a challenge between 1774 and 1780 many of the states banned the importation of slaves but the institution itself continued in 1782 virginia passed a law permitting manumission and over the next eight years more than 10000 slaves were given their freedom with support from benjamin franklin in 1790 the quakers petitioned congress to abolish slavery the number of abolitionist movements greatly increased and by 1804 all the northern states had outlawed it however even many like adams who viewed slavery as a foul contagion opposed the 1790 petition as a threat to the union in 1808 jefferson passed legislation banning the importation of slaves but allowed the domestic slave trade to continue arguing the federal government had no right to regulate individual states prior to the american revolution slavery was legal and it was normal around the world and it had been that way for thousands of years the american revolution changed that american freedom is what made slavery into an issue as historian christopher l brown put it slavery had never been on the agenda in a serious way before but the revolution forced it to be a public question from there forward historiography the body of historical writings on the american revolution cite many motivations for the patriot revolt that ultimately led to the nations independence and establishment american patriots stressed the denial of their constitutional rights as englishmen especially no taxation without representation contemporaries credit the american enlightenment with laying the intellectual moral and ethical foundations for the american revolution among the founding fathers who were influenced by the classical liberalism of john locke and other enlightenment age writers and philosophers two treatises of government has long been cited as a major influence on revolutionaryera american thinking but historians david lundberg and henry f may contend that lockes essay concerning human understanding was far more widely read than were his political treatises historians since the 1960s have emphasized that the patriot constitutional argument was made possible by the emergence of a sense of american nationalism that united the thirteen colonies in turn that nationalism was rooted in a republican value system that demanded consent of the governed and deeply opposed aristocratic control in britain on the other hand republicanism was largely a fringe ideology since it challenged the aristocratic control of the british monarchy and political system political power was not controlled by an aristocracy or nobility in the 13 colonies instead the colonial political system was based on the winners of free elections which were open at the time to the majority of white men in analysis of the revolution historians in recent decades have often cited three motivations behind it revolutionary war

current the ampere ˈ am us am symbol a often shortened to amp is the unit of electric current in the international system of units si one ampere is equal to 1 coulomb c moving past a point per second it is named after french mathematician and physicist andrémarie ampère 17751836 considered the father of electromagnetism along with danish physicist hans christian ørsted as of the 2019 redefinition of the si base units the ampere is defined by fixing the elementary charge e to be exactly e which means an ampere is an electric current equivalent to 19 elementary charges moving every 1602176634 seconds or 6241509074 elementary charges moving in a second prior to the redefinition the ampere was defined as the current passing through two parallel wires 1 metre apart that produces a magnetic force of 2 newtons per metre the earlier cgs system has two units of current one structured similarly to the sis and the other using coulombs law as a fundamental relationship with the cgs unit of charge defined by measuring the force between two charged metal plates the cgs unit of current is then defined as one unit of charge per second history the ampere is named for french physicist and mathematician andrémarie ampère 17751836 who studied electromagnetism and laid the foundation of electrodynamics in recognition of ampères contributions to the creation of modern electrical science an international convention signed at the 1881 international exposition of electricity established the ampere as a standard unit of electrical measurement for electric current the ampere was originally defined as one tenth of the unit of electric current in the centimetregramsecond system of units that unit now known as the abampere was defined as the amount of current that generates a force of two dynes per centimetre of length between two wires one centimetre apart the size of the unit was chosen so that the units derived from it in the mksa system would be conveniently sized the international ampere was an early realization of the ampere defined as the current that would deposit 0001118 of silver per second from a silver nitrate solution later more accurate measurements revealed that this current is 099985 since power is defined as the product of current and voltage the ampere can alternatively be expressed in terms of the other units using the relationship i and thus 1 a  1 wv current can be measured by a multimeter a device that can measure electrical voltage current and resistance former definition in the si until 2019 the si defined the ampere as follows the ampere is that constant current which if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length of negligible circular crosssection and placed one metre apart in vacuum would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 newtons per metre of length113 ampères force law states that there is an attractive or repulsive force between two parallel wires carrying an electric current this force is used in the formal definition of the ampere the si unit of charge the coulomb was then defined as the quantity of electricity carried in 1 second by a current of 1 ampere144 conversely a current of one ampere is one coulomb of charge going past a given point per second in general charge q was determined by steady current i flowing for a time t as q this definition of the ampere was most accurately realised using a kibble balance but in practice the unit was maintained via ohms law from the units of electromotive force and resistance the volt and the ohm since the latter two could be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce the josephson effect and the quantum hall effect respectively techniques to establish the realisation of an ampere had a relative uncertainty of approximately a few parts in 107 and involved realisations of the watt the ohm and the volt present definition the 2019 redefinition of the si base units defined the ampere by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be e when expressed in the unit c which is equal to as where the second is defined in terms of νcs the unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium133 atom the si unit of charge the coulomb is the quantity of electricity carried in 1 second by a current of 1 ampere conversely a current of one ampere is one coulomb of charge going past a given point per second in general charge q is determined by steady current i flowing for a time t as q constant instantaneous and average current are expressed in amperes as in the charging current is 12 a and the charge accumulated or passed through a circuit over a period of time is expressed in coulombs as in the battery charge is 30000 the relation of the ampere cs to the coulomb is the same as that of the watt js to the joule units derived from the ampere the international system of units si is based on seven si base units the second metre kilogram kelvin ampere mole and candela representing seven fundamental types of physical quantity or dimensions time length mass temperature electric current amount of substance and luminous intensity respectively with all other si units being defined using these these si derived units can either be given special names eg watt volt lux etc or defined in terms of others eg metre per second the units with special names derived from the ampere are there are also some si units that are frequently used in the context of electrical engineering and electrical appliances but are defined independently of the ampere notably the hertz joule watt candela lumen and lux si prefixes like other si units the ampere can be modified by adding a prefix that multiplies it by a power of 10 see also references

automated reasoning achieving automation eventually using human characteristics as descriptors of machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by alan turing with terms such as memory search and stimulus in contrast a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results especially in problem domains where there is no welldefined correct or optimal result for example social media recommender systems rely on heuristics in such a way that although widely characterized as algorithms in 21st century popular media cannot deliver correct results due to the nature of the problem as an effective method an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a welldefined formal language for calculating a function starting from an initial state and initial input perhaps empty the instructions describe a computation that when executed proceeds through a finite number of welldefined successive states eventually producing output and terminating at a final ending state the transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic some algorithms known as randomized

titled carmen de algorismo it begins with which translates to the poem is a few hundred lines long and summarizes the art of calculating with the new styled indian dice tali indorum or hindu numerals english evolution of the word around 1230 the english word algorism is attested and then by chaucer in 1391 english adopted the french term in the 15th century under the influence of the greek word ἀριθμός arithmos number cf arithmetic the latin word was altered to algorithmus in 1656 in the english dictionary glossographia it says algorism latin algorismus the art or use of cyphers or of numbering by cyphers skill in accounting augrime latin algorithmus skil in accounting or numbring in 1658 in the first edition of the new world of english words it says algorithme a word compounded of arabick and spanish the art of reckoning by cyphers in 1706 in the sixth edition of the new world of english words it says algorithm the art of computing or reckoning by numbers which contains the five principle rules of arithmetick viz numeration addition subtraction multiplication and division to which may be added extraction of roots it is also calld logistica numeralis algorism the practical operation in the several parts of specious arithmetick or algebra sometimes it is taken for the practice of common arithmetick by the ten numeral figures in 1751 in the young algebraists companion daniel fenning contrasts the terms algorism and algorithm as follows algorithm signifies the first principles and algorism the practical part or knowing how to put the algorithm in practice

reference to some particular subject or in some particular way as the algorithm of numbers the algorithm of the differential calculus machine usage in 1928 a partial formalization of the modern concept of algorithms began with attempts to solve the entscheidungsproblem decision problem posed by david hilbert later formalizations were framed as attempts to define effective calculability or effective method those formalizations included the gödelherbrandkleene recursive functions of 1930 1934 and 1935 alonzo churchs lambda calculus of 1936 emil posts formulation 1 of 1936 and alan turings turing machines of 193637 and 1939 informal definition one informal definition is a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operationsstone 1972 suggests on page 4 any sequence of instructions that can be obeyed by a robot is called an algorithm which would include all computer programs including programs that do not perform numeric calculations and for example any prescribed bureaucratic procedure or cookbook recipe in general a program is an algorithm only if it stops eventuallyeven though infinite loops may sometimes prove desirable a prototypical example of an algorithm is the euclidean algorithm which is used to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers an example there are others is described by the flowchart above and as an example in a later section boolos offer an informal meaning of the word algorithm in the following quotation an enumerably infinite set is one whose elements can be put into onetoone correspondence with the integers thus boolos and jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that creates output integers from an arbitrary input integer or integers that in theory can be arbitrarily large for example an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as y  m  n ie two arbitrary input variables m and n that produce an output y but various authors attempts to define the notion indicate that the word implies much more than this something on the order of for the addition example the concept of algorithm is also used to define the notion of decidabilitya notion that is central for explaining how formal systems come into being starting from a small set of axioms and rules in logic the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured as it is not apparently related to the customary physical dimension from such uncertainties that characterize ongoing work stems the unavailability of a definition of algorithm that suits both concrete in some sense and abstract usage of the term most algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs however algorithms are also implemented by other means such as in a biological neural network for example the human brain implementing arithmetic or an insect looking for food in an electrical circuit or in a mechanical device formalization algorithms are essential to the way computers process data many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should performin a specific orderto carry out a specified task such as calculating employees paychecks or printing students report cards thus an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a turingcomplete system authors who assert this thesis include minsky 1967 savage 1987 and gurevich 2000 annual plant categories annual plants an annual plant is a plant that completes its life cycle from germination to the production of seeds within one growing season and then dies globally only 6 of all plant species and 15 of herbaceous plants excluding trees and shrubs are annuals the annual life cycle has independently emerged in over 120 different plant families throughout the entire angiosperm phylogeny the evolutionary and ecological drivers of the annual life cycle traditionally there has been a prevailing assumption that annuals have evolved from perennial ancestors however recent research challenges this notion revealing instances where perennials have evolved from annual ancestors intriguingly models propose that transition rates from an annual to a perennial life cycle are twice as fast as the reverse transition the lifehistory theory posits that annual plants are favored when adult mortality is higher than seedling or seed mortality ie annuals will dominate environments with disturbances or high temporal variability reducing adult survival this hypothesis finds support in observations of increased prevalence of annuals in regions with hotdry summers with elevated adult mortality and high seed persistence furthermore the evolution of the annual life cycle under hotdry summer in different families makes it one of the best examples of convergent evolution additionally annual prevalence is also positively affected by yeartoyear variability globally the prevalence of annual plants shows an upward trend with an increasing human footprint moreover domestic grazing has been identified as contributing to the heightened abundance of annuals in grasslands disturbances linked to activities like grazing and agriculture particularly following european settlement have facilitated the invasion of annual species from europe and asia into the new world in various ecosystems the dominance of annual plants is often a temporary phase during secondary succession particularly in the aftermath of disturbances for instance after fields are abandoned annuals may initially colonize them but are eventually replaced by longlived species however in certain mediterranean systems a unique scenario unfolds when annuals establish dominance perennials do not necessarily supplant them this peculiarity is attributed to alternative stable states in the systemboth annual dominance and perennial states prove stable with the ultimate system state dependent on the initial conditions traits of annuals and their implication for agriculture annual plants commonly exhibit a higher growth rate allocate more resources to seeds and allocate fewer resources to roots than perennials in contrast to perennials which feature longlived plants and shortlived seeds annual plants compensate for their lower longevity by maintaining a higher persistence of soil seed banks these differences in life history strategies profoundly affect ecosystem functioning and services for instance annuals by allocating less resources belowground play a minor role in reducing erosion storing organic carbon and achieving lower nutrient and wateruse efficiencies than perennials the distinctions between annual and perennial plants are notably evident in agricultural contexts despite constituting a minor part of global biomass annual species stand out as the primary food source for humankind likely owing to their greater allocation of resources to seed production thereby enhancing agricultural productivity in the anthropocene epoch marked by human impact on the environment there has been a substantial increase in the global cover of annuals this shift is primarily attributed to the conversion of natural systems often dominated by perennials into annual cropland  currently annual plants cover approximately 70 of croplands and contribute to around 80 of worldwide food consumption molecular genetics in 2008 it was discovered that the inactivation of only two genes in one species of annual plant leads to its conversion into a perennial plant researchers deactivated the soc1 and ful genes which control flowering time of arabidopsis thaliana this switch established phenotypes common in perennial plants such as wood formation see also references external links anthophyta categories historically recognized plant taxa the anthophytes are a paraphyletic grouping of plant taxa bearing flowerlike reproductive structures the group once thought to be a clade contained the angiosperms  the extant flowering plants such as roses and grasses  as well as the gnetales and the extinct bennettitales detailed morphological and molecular studies have shown that the group is not actually monophyletic with proposed floral homologies of the gnetophytes and the angiosperms having evolved in parallel this makes it easier to reconcile molecular clock data that suggests that the angiosperms diverged from the gymnosperms around 320300 mya some more recent studies have used the word anthophyte to describe a hypothetical group which includes the angiosperms and a variety of extinct seed plant groups with various suggestions including at least some of the following groups glossopterids corystosperms petriellales pentoxylales bennettitales and caytoniales but not the gnetales

limited evidence base for best practice use common use involves rinsing the mouth with about 2050 ml 23 fl oz of mouthwash the wash is typically swished or gargled for about half a minute and then spat out most companies suggest not drinking water immediately after using mouthwash in some brands the expectorate is stained so that one can see the bacteria and debris mouthwash should not be used immediately after brushing the teeth so as not to wash away the beneficial fluoride residue left from the toothpaste similarly the mouth should not be rinsed out with water after brushing patients were told to spit dont rinse after toothbrushing as part of a national health service campaign in the uk a fluoride mouthrinse can be used at a different time of the day to brushing gargling is where the head is tilted back allowing the mouthwash to sit in the back of the mouth while exhaling causing the liquid to bubble gargling is practiced in japan for perceived prevention of viral infection one commonly used way is with infusions or tea in some cultures gargling is usually done in private typically in a bathroom at a sink so the liquid can be rinsed away dangerous misuse if one drinks mouthwash serious harm and even death can quickly result from the high alcohol content and other substances harmful to ingestion present in mouthwash it is a common cause of death among homeless people during winter months because a person can feel warmer after drinking it  effects the mostcommonlyused mouthwashes are commercial antiseptics which are used at home as part of an oral hygiene routine mouthwashes combine ingredients to treat a variety of oral conditions variations are common and mouthwash has no standard formulation so its use and recommendation involves concerns about patient safety some manufacturers of mouthwash state that their antiseptic and antiplaque mouthwashes kill the bacterial plaque that causes cavities gingivitis and bad breath it is however generally agreed that the use of mouthwash does not eliminate the need for both brushing and flossing the american dental association asserts that regular brushing and proper flossing are enough in most cases in addition to regular dental checkups although they approve many mouthwashes for many patients however the mechanical methods could be tedious and timeconsuming and additionally some local conditions may render them especially difficult chemotherapeutic agents including mouthwashes could have a key role as adjuncts to daily home care preventing and controlling supragingival plaque gingivitis and oral malodor minor and transient side effects of mouthwashes are very common such as taste disturbance tooth staining sensation of a dry mouth etc alcoholcontaining mouthwashes may make dry mouth and halitosis worse as they dry out the mouth soreness ulceration and redness may sometimes occur eg aphthous stomatitis or allergic contact stomatitis if the person is allergic or sensitive to mouthwash ingredients such as preservatives coloring flavors and fragrances such effects might be reduced or eliminated by diluting the mouthwash with water using a different mouthwash eg saltwater or foregoing mouthwash entirely prescription mouthwashes are used prior to and after oral surgery procedures such as tooth extraction or to treat the pain associated with mucositis caused by radiation therapy or chemotherapy they are also prescribed for aphthous ulcers other oral ulcers and other mouth pain magic mouthwashes are prescription mouthwashes compounded in a pharmacy from a list of ingredients specified by a doctor despite a lack of evidence that prescription mouthwashes are more effective in decreasing the pain of oral lesions many patients and prescribers continue to use them there has been only one controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of magic mouthwash it shows no difference in efficacy between the most common magicmouthwash formulation on the one hand and commercial mouthwashes such as chlorhexidine or a salinebaking soda solution on the other current guidelines suggest that saline solution is just as effective as magic mouthwash in pain relief and in shortening the healing time of oral mucositis from cancer therapies history the first known references to mouth rinsing is in ayurveda for treatment of gingivitis later in the greek and roman periods mouth rinsing following mechanical cleansing became common among the upper classes and hippocrates recommended a mixture of salt alum and vinegar the jewish talmud dating back about 1800 years suggests a cure for gum ailments containing dough water and olive oil the ancient chinese had also gargled salt water tea and wine as a form of mouthwash after meals due to the antiseptic properties of those liquids before europeans came to the americas native north american and mesoamerican cultures used mouthwashes often made from plants such as coptis trifolia peoples of the americas used salt water mouthwashes for sore throats and other mouthwashes for problems such as teething and mouth ulcers anton van leeuwenhoek the famous 17th century microscopist discovered living organisms living because they were mobile in deposits on the teeth what we now call dental plaque he also found organisms in water from the canal next to his home in delft he experimented with samples by adding vinegar or brandy and found that this resulted in the immediate immobilization or killing of the organisms suspended in water next he tried rinsing the mouth of himself and somebody else with a mouthwash containing vinegar or brandy and found that living organisms remained in the dental plaque he concludedcorrectlythat the mouthwash either did not reach or was not present long enough to kill the plaque organisms in 1892 german richard seifert invented mouthwash product odol which was produced by company founder karl august lingner 18611916 in dresden that remained the state of affairs until the late 1960s when harald loe at the time a professor at the royal dental college in aarhus denmark demonstrated that a chlorhexidine compound could prevent the buildup of dental plaque the reason for chlorhexidines effectiveness is that it strongly adheres to surfaces in the mouth and thus remains present in effective concentrations for many hours since then commercial interest in mouthwashes has been intense and several newer products claim effectiveness in reducing the buildup in dental plaque and the associated severity of gingivitis in addition to fighting bad breath many of these solutions aim to control the volatile sulfur compoundcreating anaerobic bacteria that live in the mouth and excrete substances that lead to bad breath and unpleasant mouth taste for example the number of mouthwash variants in the united states of america has grown from 15 1970 to 66 1998 to 113 2012 research research in the field of microbiotas shows that only a limited set of microbes cause tooth decay with most of the bacteria in the human mouth being harmless focused attention on cavitycausing bacteria such as streptococcus mutans has led research into new mouthwash treatments that prevent these bacteria from initially growing while current mouthwash treatments must be used with a degree of frequency to prevent this bacteria from regrowing future treatments could provide a viable longterm solution a clinical trial and laboratory studies have shown that alcoholcontaining mouthwash could reduce the growth of neisseria gonorrhoeae in the pharynx however subsequent trials have found that there was no difference in gonorrhoea cases among men using daily mouthwash compared to those who did not use mouthwash for 12 weeks ingredients alcohol alcohol is added to mouthwash not to destroy bacteria but to act as a carrier agent for essential active ingredients such as menthol eucalyptol and thymol which help to penetrate plaque sometimes a significant amount of alcohol up to 27 vol is added as a carrier for the flavor to provide biteseptember 2011 because of the alcohol content it is possible to fail a breathalyzer test after rinsing although breath alcohol levels return to normal after 10 minutes in addition alcohol is a drying agent which encourages bacterial activity in the mouth releasing more malodorous volatile sulfur compounds therefore alcoholcontaining mouthwash may temporarily worsen halitosis in those who already have it or indeed be the sole cause of halitosis in other individuals it is hypothesized that alcohol in mouthwashes acts as a carcinogen cancerinducing agent generally there is no scientific consensus about this one review stated the same researchers also state that the risk of acquiring oral cancer rises almost five times for users of alcoholcontaining mouthwash who neither smoke nor drink with a higher rate of increase for those who do in addition the authors highlight side effects from several mainstream mouthwashes that included dental erosion and accidental poisoning of children the review garnered media attention and conflicting opinions from other researchers yinka ebo of cancer research uk disputed the findings concluding that there is still not enough evidence to suggest that using mouthwash that contains alcohol will increase the risk of mouth cancer studies conducted in 1985 1995 2003 and 2012 did not support an association between alcoholcontaining mouth rinses and oral cancer andrew penman chief executive of the cancer council new south wales called for further research on the matter in a march 2009 brief the american dental association said the available evidence does not support a connection between oral cancer and alcoholcontaining mouthrinse many newer brands of mouthwash are alcoholfree not just in response to consumer concerns about oral cancer but also to cater for religious groups who abstain from alcohol consumption benzydamine analgesic in painful oral conditions such as aphthous stomatitis analgesic mouthrinses eg benzydamine mouthwash or difflam are sometimes used to ease pain commonly used before meals to reduce discomfort while eating benzoic acid benzoic acid acts as a buffer betamethasone betamethasone is sometimes used as an antiinflammatory corticosteroid mouthwash it may be used for severe inflammatory conditions of the oral mucosa such as the severe forms of aphthous stomatitis209 cetylpyridinium chloride antiseptic antimalodor cetylpyridinium chloride containing mouthwash eg 005 is used in some specialized mouthwashes for halitosis cetylpyridinium chloride mouthwash has less antiplaque effect than chlorhexidine and may cause staining of teeth or sometimes an oral burning sensation or ulceration chlorhexidine digluconate and hexetidine antiseptic chlorhexidine digluconate is a chemical antiseptic and is used in a 00502 solution as a mouthwash there is no evidence to support that higher concentrations are more effective in controlling dental plaque and gingivitis a randomized clinical trial conducted in rabat university in morocco found better results in plaque inhibition when chlorohexidine with alcohol base 012 was used when compared to an alcoholfree 01 chlorhexidine mouthrinse chlorhexidine has good substantivity the ability of a mouthwash to bind to hard and soft tissues in the mouth it has antiplaque action and also some antifungal action it is especially effective against gramnegative rods the proportion of gramnegative rods increase as gingivitis develops so it is also used to reduce gingivitis it is sometimes used as an adjunct to prevent dental caries and to treat periodontal disease although it does not penetrate into periodontal pockets well chlorhexidine mouthwash alone is unable to prevent plaque so it is not a substitute for regular toothbrushing and flossing instead chlorhexidine mouthwash is more effective when used as an adjunctive treatment with toothbrushing and flossing in the short term if toothbrushing is impossible due to pain as may occur in primary herpetic gingivostomatitis chlorhexidine mouthwash is used as a temporary substitute for other oral hygiene measures it is not suited for use in acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis however rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthwash before and after a tooth extraction may reduce the risk of a dry socket other uses of chlorhexidine mouthwash include prevention of oral candidiasis in immunocompromised persons treatment of denturerelated stomatitis mucosal ulcerationerosions and oral mucosal lesions general burning sensation and many other uses chlorhexidine mouthwash is known to have minor adverse effects chlorhexidine binds to tannins meaning that prolonged use in persons who consume coffee tea or red wine is associated with extrinsic staining ie removable staining of teeth a systematic review of commercial chlorhexidine products with antidiscoloration systems adss found that the adss were able to reduce tooth staining without affecting the beneficial effects of chlorhexidine chlorhexidine mouthwash can also cause taste disturbance or alteration chlorhexidine is rarely associated with other issues like overgrowth of enterobacteria in persons with leukemia desquamation irritation and stomatitis of oral mucosa salivary gland pain and swelling and hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis hexetidine also has antiplaque analgesic astringent and antimalodor properties but is considered an inferior alternative to chlorhexidine edible oils in traditional ayurvedic medicine the use of oil mouthwashes is called kavala oil swishing or gandusha and this practice has more recently been remarketed by the complementary and alternative medicine industry as oil pulling its promoters claim it works by pulling out toxins which are known as ama in ayurvedic medicine and thereby reducing inflammation ayurvedic literature claims that oil pulling is capable of improving oral and systemic health including a benefit in conditions such as headaches migraines diabetes mellitus asthma and acne as well as whitening teeth oil pulling has received little study and there is little evidence to support claims made by the techniques advocates when compared with chlorhexidine in one small study it was found to be less effective at reducing oral bacterial load and the other health claims of oil pulling have failed scientific verification or have not been investigated there is a report of lipid pneumonia caused by accidental inhalation of the oil during oil pulling the mouth is rinsed with approximately one tablespoon of oil for 1020 minutes then spat out sesame oil coconut oil and ghee are traditionally used but newer oils such as sunflower oil are also used essential oils phenolic compounds and monoterpenes include essential oil constituents that have some antibacterial properties such as eucalyptol eugenol hinokitiol menthol phenol or thymol essential oils are oils which have been extracted from plants mouthwashes based on essential oils could be more effective than traditional mouthcare as antigingival treatments they have been found effective in reducing halitosis and are being used in several commercial mouthwashes fluoride anticavity anticavity mouthwashes use sodium fluoride to protect against tooth decay fluoridecontaining mouthwashes are used as prevention for dental caries for individuals who are considered at higher risk for tooth decay whether due to xerostomia related to salivary dysfunction or side effects of medication to not drinking fluoridated water or to being physically unable to care for their oral needs brushing and flossing and as treatment for those with dentinal hypersensitivity gingival recession root exposure flavoring agents and xylitol flavoring agents include sweeteners such as sorbitol sucralose sodium saccharin and xylitol which stimulate salivary function due to their sweetness and taste and helps restore the mouth to a neutral level of acidity xylitol rinses double as a bacterial inhibitor and have been used as substitute for alcohol to avoid dryness of mouth associated with alcohol hydrogen peroxide hydrogen peroxide can be used as an oxidizing mouthwash eg peroxyl 15 it kills anaerobic bacteria and also has a mechanical cleansing action when it froths as it comes into contact with debris in mouth it is often used in the short term to treat acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis side effects can occur with prolonged use including hypertrophy of the lingual papillae lactoperoxidase saliva substitute enzymes and nonenzymatic proteins such as lactoperoxidase lysozyme and lactoferrin have been used in mouthwashes eg biotene to reduce levels of oral bacteria and hence of the acids produced by these bacteria lidocainexylocaine oral lidocaine is useful for the treatment of mucositis symptoms inflammation of mucous membranes induced by radiation or chemotherapy there is evidence that lidocaine anesthetic mouthwash has the potential to be systemically absorbed when it was tested in patients with oral mucositis who underwent a bone marrow transplant methyl salicylate methyl salicylate functions as an antiseptic antiinflammatory and analgesic agent a flavoring and a fragrance methyl salicylate has some antiplaque action but less than chlorhexidine methyl salicylate does not stain teeth nystatin nystatin suspension is an antifungal ingredient used for the treatment of oral candidiasis potassium oxalate a randomized clinical trial found promising results in controlling and reducing dentine hypersensitivity when potassium oxalate mouthwash was used in conjugation with toothbrushing povidoneiodine pvpi a 2005 study found that gargling three times a day with simple water or with a povidoneiodine solution was effective in preventing upper respiratory infection and decreasing the severity of symptoms if contracted other sources attribute the benefit to a simple placebo effect pvpi in general covers a wider virucidal spectrum covering both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses than the other commercially available antiseptics which also includes the novel sarscov2 virus sanguinarine sanguinarinecontaining mouthwashes are marketed as antiplaque and antimalodor treatments sanguinarine is a toxic alkaloid herbal extract obtained from plants such as sanguinaria canadensis bloodroot argemone mexicana mexican prickly poppy and others however its use is strongly associated with the development of leukoplakia a white patch in the mouth usually in the buccal sulcus this type of leukoplakia has been termed sanguinariaassociated keratosis and more than 80 of people with leukoplakia in the vestibule of the mouth have used this substance upon stopping contact with the causative substance the lesions may persist for years although this type of leukoplakia may show dysplasia the potential for malignant transformation is unknown ironically elements within the complementary and alternative medicine industry promote the use of sanguinaria as a therapy for cancer sodium bicarbonate baking soda sodium bicarbonate is sometimes combined with salt to make a simple homemade mouthwash indicated for any of the reasons that a saltwater mouthwash might be used premixed mouthwashes of 1 sodium bicarbonate and 15 sodium chloride in aqueous solution are marketed although pharmacists will easily be able to produce such a formulation from the base ingredients when required sodium bicarbonate mouthwash is sometimes used to remove viscous saliva and to aid visualization of the oral tissues during examination of the mouth4 sodium chloride salt saline has a mechanical cleansing action and an antiseptic action as it is a hypertonic solution in relation to bacteria which undergo lysis the heat of the solution produces a therapeutic increase in blood flow hyperemia to the surgical site promoting healing hot saltwater mouthwashes also encourage the draining of pus from dental abscesses in contrast if heat is applied on the side of the face eg hot water bottle rather than inside the mouth it may cause a dental abscess to drain extraorally which is later associated with an area of fibrosis on the face see cutaneous sinus of dental origin saltwater mouthwashes are also routinely used after oral surgery to keep food debris out of healing wounds and to prevent infection some oral surgeons consider saltwater mouthwashes the mainstay of wound cleanliness after surgery in dental extractions hot saltwater mouthbaths should start about 24 hours after a dental extraction the term mouth bath implies that the liquid is passively held in the mouth rather than vigorously swilled around which could dislodge a blood clot once the blood clot has stabilized the mouthwash can be used more vigorously these mouthwashes tend to be advised for use about 6 times per day especially after meals to remove food from the socket sodium lauryl sulfate foaming agent sodium lauryl sulfate sls is used as a foaming agent in many oral hygiene products including many mouthwashes some may suggest that it is probably advisable to use mouthwash at least an hour after brushing with toothpaste when the toothpaste contains sls since the anionic compounds in the sls toothpaste can deactivate cationic agents present in the mouthwash sucralfate sucralfate is a mucosal coating agent composed of an aluminum salt of sulfated sucrose it is not recommended for use in the prevention of oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy or chemoradiation due to a lack of efficacy found in a welldesigned randomized controlled trial tetracycline antibiotic tetracycline is an antibiotic which may sometimes be used as a mouthwash in adults it causes red staining of teeth in children it is sometimes use for herpetiforme ulceration an uncommon type of aphthous stomatitis but prolonged use may lead to oral candidiasis as the fungal population of the mouth overgrows in the absence of enough competing bacteria209 similarly minocycline mouthwashes of 05 concentrations can relieve symptoms of recurrent aphthous stomatitis erythromycin is similar tranexamic acid a 48 tranexamic acid solution is sometimes used as an antifibrinolytic mouthwash to prevent bleeding during and after oral surgery in persons with coagulopathies clotting disorders or who are taking anticoagulants blood thinners such as warfarin473 triclosan triclosan is a nonionic chlorinate bisphenol antiseptic found in some mouthwashes when used in mouthwash eg 003 there is moderate substantivity broad spectrum antibacterial action some antifungal action and significant antiplaque effect especially when combined with a copolymer or zinc citrate triclosan does not cause staining of the teeth the safety of triclosan has been questioned zinc astringents like zinc chloride provide a pleasanttasting sensation and shrink tissues zinc when used in combination with other antiseptic agents can limit the buildup of tartar see also references external links alexander the great categories alexander the great ancient persia 4thcentury bc

macedon alexandros 2021 july 356 bc  1011 june 323 bc most commonly known as alexander the greatc was a king of the ancient greek kingdom of macedond he succeeded his father philip ii to the throne in 336 bc at the age of 20 and spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout western asia central asia parts of south asia and egypt by the age of 30 he had created one of the largest empires in history stretching from greece to northwestern india he was undefeated in battle and is widely considered to be one of historys greatest and most successful military commanders until the age of 16 alexander was tutored by aristotle in 335 bc shortly after his assumption of kingship over macedon he campaigned in the balkans and reasserted control over thrace and parts of illyria before marching on the city of thebes which was subsequently destroyed in battle alexander then led the league of corinth and used his authority to launch the panhellenic project envisaged by his father assuming leadership over all greeks in their conquest of persia in 334 bc he invaded the achaemenid persian empire and began a series of campaigns that lasted for 10 years following his conquest of asia minor alexander broke the power of achaemenid persia in a series of decisive battles including those at issus and gaugamela he subsequently overthrew darius iii and conquered the achaemenid empire in its entiretye after the fall of persia the macedonian empire held a vast swath of territory between the adriatic sea and the indus river alexander endeavored to reach the ends of the world and the great outer sea and invaded india in 326 bc achieving an important victory over porus an ancient indian king of presentday punjab at the battle of the hydaspes due to the demand of his homesick troops he eventually turned back at the beas river and later died in 323 bc in babylon the city of mesopotamia that he had planned to establish as his empires capital alexanders death left unexecuted an additional series of planned military and mercantile campaigns that would have begun with a greek invasion of arabia in the years following his death a series of civil wars broke out across the macedonian empire eventually leading to its disintegration at the hands of the diadochi with his death marking the start of the hellenistic period alexanders legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism that his conquests engendered such as grecobuddhism and hellenistic judaism he founded more than twenty cities with the most prominent being the city of alexandria in egypt alexanders settlement of greek colonists and the resulting spread of greek culture led to the overwhelming dominance of hellenistic civilization and influence as far east as the indian subcontinent the hellenistic period developed through the roman empire into modern western culture the greek language became the lingua franca of the region and was the predominant language of the byzantine empire up until its collapse in the mid15th century ad alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of achilles featuring prominently in the historical and mythical traditions of both greek and nongreek cultures his military achievements and unprecedented enduring successes in battle made him the measure against which many later military leaders would compare themselvesf and his tactics remain a significant subject of study in military academies worldwide legends of alexanders exploits coalesced into the thirdcentury alexander romance which in the premodern period went through over one hundred recensions translations and derivations and was translated into almost every european vernacular and every language of the islamic world after the bible it was the most popular form of european literature early life lineage and childhood alexander iii was born in pella the capital of the kingdom of macedon on the sixth day of the ancient greek month of hekatombaion which probably corresponds to 20 july 356 bc although the exact date is uncertain he was the son of the erstwhile king of macedon philip ii and his fourth wife olympias daughter of neoptolemus i king of epirusg although philip had seven or eight wives olympias was his principal wife for some time likely because she gave birth to alexander several legends surround alexanders birth and childhood according to the ancient greek biographer plutarch on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to philip olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread far and wide before dying away sometime after the wedding philip is said to have seen himself in a dream securing his wifes womb with a seal engraved with a lions image plutarch offered a variety of interpretations for these dreams that olympias was pregnant before her marriage indicated by the sealing of her womb or that alexanders father was zeus ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious olympias promulgated the story of alexanders divine parentage variously claiming that she had told alexander or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious on the day alexander was born philip was preparing a siege on the city of potidea on the peninsula of chalcidice that same day philip received news that his general parmenion had defeated the combined illyrian and paeonian armies and that his horses had won at the olympic games it was also said that on this day the temple of artemis in ephesus one of the seven wonders of the world burnt down this led hegesias of magnesia to say that it had burnt down because artemis was away attending the birth of alexander such legends may have emerged when alexander was king and possibly at his instigation to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception in his early years alexander was raised by a nurse lanike sister of alexanders future general cleitus the black later in his childhood alexander was tutored by the strict leonidas a relative of his mother and by lysimachus of acarnania alexander was raised in the manner of noble macedonian youths learning to read play the lyre ride fight and hunt when alexander was ten years old a trader from thessaly brought philip a horse which he offered to sell for thirteen talents the horse refused to be mounted and philip ordered it away alexander however detecting the horses fear of its own shadow asked to tame the horse which he eventually managed plutarch stated that philip overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition kissed his son tearfully declaring my boy you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions macedon is too small for you and bought the horse for him alexander named it bucephalas meaning oxhead bucephalas carried alexander as far as india when the animal died because of old age according to plutarch at age 30 alexander named a city after him bucephala education when alexander was 13 philip began to search for a tutor and considered such academics as isocrates and speusippus the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of the academy to take up the post in the end philip chose aristotle and provided the temple of the nymphs at mieza as a classroom in return for teaching alexander philip agreed to rebuild aristotles hometown of stageira which philip had razed and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the excitizens who were slaves or pardoning those who were in exile mieza was like a boarding school for alexander and the children of macedonian nobles such as ptolemy hephaistion and cassander many of these students would become his friends and future generals and are often known as the companions aristotle taught alexander and his companions about medicine philosophy morals religion logic and art under aristotles tutelage alexander developed a passion for the works of homer and in particular the iliad aristotle gave him an annotated copy which alexander later carried on his campaigns alexander was able to quote euripides from memory during his youth alexander was also acquainted with persian exiles at the macedonian court who received the protection of philip ii for several years as they opposed artaxerxes iii among them were artabazos ii and his daughter barsine possible future mistress of alexander who resided at the macedonian court from 352 to 342 bc as well as amminapes future satrap of alexander or a persian nobleman named sisines this gave the macedonian court a good knowledge of persian issues and may even have influenced some of the innovations in the management of the macedonian state suda writes that anaximenes of lampsacus was one of alexanders teachers and that anaximenes also accompanied alexander on his campaigns heir of philip ii regency and ascent of macedon at the age of 16 alexanders education under aristotle ended philip ii had waged war against the thracians to the north which left alexander in charge as regent and heir apparent during philips absence the thracian tribe of maedi revolted against macedonia alexander responded quickly and drove them from their territory the territory was colonized and a city named alexandropolis was founded upon philips return alexander was dispatched with a small force to subdue the revolts in southern thrace campaigning against the greek city of perinthus alexander reportedly saved his fathers life meanwhile the city of amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to apollo near delphi a sacrilege that gave philip the opportunity to further intervene in greek affairs while philip was occupied in thrace alexander was ordered to muster an army for a campaign in southern greece concerned that other greek states might intervene alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack illyria instead during this turmoil the illyrians invaded macedonia only to be repelled by alexander philip and his army joined his son in 338 bc and they marched south through thermopylae taking it after stubborn resistance from its theban garrison they went on to occupy the city of elatea only a few days march from both athens and thebes the athenians led by demosthenes voted to seek alliance with thebes against macedonia both athens and philip sent embassies to win thebess favour but athens won the contest philip marched on amphissa ostensibly acting on the request of the amphictyonic league capturing the mercenaries sent there by demosthenes and accepting the citys surrender philip then returned to elatea sending a final offer of peace to athens and thebes who both rejected it as philip marched south his opponents blocked him near chaeronea boeotia during the ensuing battle of chaeronea philip commanded the right wing and alexander the left accompanied by a group of philips trusted generals according to the ancient sources the two sides fought bitterly for some time philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat counting on the untested athenian hoplites to follow thus breaking their line alexander was the first to break the theban lines followed by philips generals having damaged the enemys cohesion philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them with the athenians lost the thebans were surrounded left to fight alone they were defeated after the victory at chaeronea philip and alexander marched unopposed into the peloponnese welcomed by all cities however when they reached sparta they were refused but did not resort to war at corinth philip established a hellenic alliance modelled on the old antipersian alliance of the grecopersian wars which included most greek citystates except sparta philip was then named hegemon often translated as supreme commander of this league known by modern scholars as the league of corinth and announced his plans to attack the persian empire exile and return when philip returned to pella he fell in love with and married cleopatra eurydice in 338 bc the niece of his general attalus the marriage made alexanders position as heir less secure since any son of cleopatra eurydice would be a fully macedonian heir while alexander was only halfmacedonian during the wedding banquet a drunken attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir in 337 bc alexander fled macedon with his mother dropping her off with her brother king alexander i of epirus in dodona capital of the molossians he continued to illyria where he sought refuge with one or more illyrian kings perhaps with glaucias and was treated as a guest despite having defeated them in battle a few years before however it appears philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son accordingly alexander returned to macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend demaratus who mediated between the two parties in the following year the persian satrap governor of caria pixodarus offered his eldest daughter to alexanders halfbrother philip arrhidaeus olympias and several of alexanders friends suggested this showed philip intended to make arrhidaeus his heir alexander reacted by sending an actor thessalus of corinth to tell pixodarus that he should not offer his daughters hand to an illegitimate son but instead to alexander when philip heard of this he stopped the negotiations and scolded alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a carian explaining that he wanted a better bride for him philip exiled four of alexanders friends harpalus nearchus ptolemy and erigyius and had the corinthians bring thessalus to him in chains king of macedon accession in summer 336 bc while at aegae attending the wedding of his daughter cleopatra to olympiass brother alexander i of epirus philip was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguards pausaniash as pausanias tried to escape he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers including two of alexanders companions perdiccas and leonnatus alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and army at the age of 20 consolidation of power alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne he had his cousin the former amyntas iv executed he also had two macedonian princes from the region of lyncestis killed for having been involved in his fathers assassination but spared a third alexander lyncestes olympias had cleopatra eurydice and europa her daughter by philip burned alive when alexander learned about this he was furious alexander also ordered the murder of attalus who was in command of the advance guard of the army in asia minor and cleopatras uncle attalus was at that time corresponding with demosthenes regarding the possibility of defecting to athens attalus also had severely insulted alexander and following cleopatras murder alexander may have considered him too dangerous to be left alive alexander spared arrhidaeus who was by all accounts mentally disabled possibly as a result of poisoning by olympias news of philips death roused many states into revolt including thebes athens thessaly and the thracian tribes north of macedon when news of the revolts reached alexander he responded quickly though advised to use diplomacy alexander mustered 3000 macedonian cavalry and rode south towards thessaly he found the thessalian army occupying the pass between mount olympus and mount ossa and ordered his men to ride over mount ossa when the thessalians awoke the next day they found alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered adding their cavalry to alexanders force he then continued south towards the peloponnese alexander stopped at thermopylae where he was recognized as the leader of the amphictyonic league before heading south to corinth athens sued for peace and alexander pardoned the rebels the famous encounter between alexander and diogenes the cynic occurred during alexanders stay in corinth when alexander asked diogenes what he could do for him the philosopher disdainfully asked alexander to stand a little to the side as he was blocking the sunlight this reply apparently delighted alexander who is reported to have said but verily if i were not alexander i would like to be diogenes at corinth alexander took the title of hegemon leader and like philip was appointed commander for the coming war against persia he also received news of a thracian uprising balkan campaign before crossing to asia alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders in the spring of 335 bc he advanced to suppress several revolts starting from amphipolis he travelled east into the country of the independent thracians and at mount haemus the macedonian army attacked and defeated the thracian forces manning the heights the macedonians marched into the country of the triballi and defeated their army near the lyginus river a tributary of the danube alexander then marched for three days to the danube encountering the getae tribe on the opposite shore crossing the river at night he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish news then reached alexander that the illyrian chieftain cleitus and king glaukias of the taulantii were in open revolt against his authority marching west into illyria alexander defeated each in turn forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops with these victories he secured his northern frontier destruction of thebes while alexander campaigned north the thebans and athenians rebelled once again alexander immediately headed south while the other cities again hesitated thebes decided to fight the theban resistance was ineffective and alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other boeotian cities the end of thebes cowed athens leaving all of greece temporarily at peace alexander then set out on his asian campaign leaving antipater as regent conquest of the achaemenid persian empire asia minor after his victory at the battle of chaeronea 338 bc philip ii began the work of establishing himself as hēgemṓn ἡγεμών of a league which according to diodorus was to wage a campaign against the persians for the sundry grievances greece suffered in 480 and free the greek cities of the western coast and islands from achaemenid rule in 336 he sent parmenion amyntas andromenes attalus and an army of 10000 men into anatolia to make preparations for an invasion at first all went well the greek cities on the western coast of anatolia revolted until the news arrived that philip had been murdered and had been succeeded by his young son alexander the macedonians were demoralized by philips death and were subsequently defeated near magnesia by the achaemenids under the command of the mercenary memnon of rhodes taking over the invasion project of philip ii alexanders army crossed the hellespont in 334 bc with approximately 48100 soldiers 6100 cavalry and a fleet of 120 ships with crews numbering 38000 drawn from macedon and various greek citystates mercenaries and feudally raised soldiers from thrace paionia and illyriai he showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the persian empire by throwing a spear into asian soil and saying he accepted asia as a gift from the gods this also showed alexanders eagerness to fight in contrast to his fathers preference for diplomacy after an initial victory against persian forces at the battle of the granicus alexander accepted the surrender of the persian provincial capital and treasury of sardis he then proceeded along the ionian coast granting autonomy and democracy to the cities miletus held by achaemenid forces required a delicate siege operation with persian naval forces nearby further south at halicarnassus in caria alexander successfully waged his first largescale siege eventually forcing his opponents the mercenary captain memnon of rhodes and the persian satrap of caria orontobates to withdraw by sea alexander left the government of caria to a member of the hecatomnid dynasty ada who adopted alexander from halicarnassus alexander proceeded into mountainous lycia and the pamphylian plain asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the persians naval bases from pamphylia onwards the coast held no major ports and alexander moved inland at termessos alexander humbled but did not storm the pisidian city at the ancient phrygian capital of gordium alexander undid the hitherto unsolvable gordian knot a feat said to await the future king of asia according to the story alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and hacked it apart with his sword the levant and syria in spring 333 bc alexander crossed the taurus into cilicia after a long pause due to an illness he marched on towards syria though outmanoeuvered by dariuss significantly larger army he marched back to cilicia where he defeated darius at issus darius fled the battle causing his army to collapse and left behind his wife his two daughters his mother sisygambis and a fabulous treasure he offered a peace treaty that included the lands he had already lost and a ransom of 10000 talents for his family alexander replied that since he was now king of asia it was he alone who decided territorial divisions alexander proceeded to take possession of syria and most of the coast of the levant in the following year 332 bc he was forced to attack tyre which he captured after a long and difficult siege the men of military age were massacred and the women and children sold into slavery egypt when alexander destroyed tyre most of the towns on the route to egypt quickly capitulated however alexander was met with resistance at gaza the stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill requiring a siege when his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible this encouraged alexander all the more to make the attempt after three unsuccessful assaults the stronghold fell but not before alexander had received a serious shoulder wound as in tyre men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery egypt was only one of a large number of territories taken by alexander from the persians after his trip to siwa alexander was crowned in the temple of ptah at memphis it appears that the egyptian people did not find it disturbing that he was a foreigner  nor that he was absent for virtually his entire reign alexander restored the temples neglected by the persians and dedicated new monuments to the egyptian gods in the temple of luxor near karnak he built a chapel for the sacred barge during his brief months in egypt he reformed the taxation system on the greek models and organized the military occupation of the country but early in 331 bc he left for asia in pursuit of the persians alexander advanced on egypt in later 332 bc where he was regarded as a liberator to legitimize taking power and be recognized as the descendant of the long line of pharaohs alexander made sacrifices to the gods at memphis and went to consult the famous oracle of amunra at the siwa oasis in the libyan desert at which he was pronounced the son of the deity amun henceforth alexander often referred to zeusammon as his true father and after his death currency depicted him adorned with horns using the horns of ammon as a symbol of his divinity the greeks interpreted this message  one that the gods addressed to all pharaohs  as a prophecy during his stay in egypt he founded alexandria which would become the prosperous capital of the ptolemaic kingdom after his death control of egypt passed to ptolemy i son of lagos the founder of the ptolemaic dynasty 30530 bc after the death of alexander assyria and babylonia leaving egypt in 331 bc alexander marched eastward into achaemenid assyria in upper mesopotamia now northern iraq and defeated darius again at the battle of gaugamela darius once more fled the field and alexander chased him as far as arbela gaugamela would be the final and decisive encounter between the two darius fled over the mountains to ecbatana modern hamadan while alexander captured babylon babylonian astronomical diaries say that the king of the world alexander sent his scouts with a message to the people of babylon before entering the city i shall not enter your houses persia from babylon alexander went to susa one of the achaemenid capitals and captured its treasury he sent the bulk of his army to the persian ceremonial capital of persepolis via the persian royal road alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city he then stormed the pass of the persian gates in the modern zagros mountains which had been blocked by a persian army under ariobarzanes and then hurried to persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury on entering persepolis alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days alexander stayed in persepolis for five months during his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of xerxes i and spread to the rest of the city possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the acropolis of athens during the second persian war by xerxes plutarch and diodorus allege that alexanders companion the hetaera thaïs instigated and started the fire even as he watched the city burn alexander immediately began to regret his decision plutarch claims that he ordered his men to put out the fires but that the flames had already spread to most of the city curtius claims that alexander did not regret his decision until the next morning plutarch recounts an anecdote in which alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of xerxes as if it were a live person fall of the persian empire and the east alexander then chased darius first into media and then parthia the persian king no longer controlled his own destiny and was taken prisoner by bessus his bactrian satrap and kinsman as alexander approached bessus had his men fatally stab the great king and then declared himself dariuss successor as artaxerxes v before retreating into central asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against alexander alexander buried dariuss remains next to his achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral he claimed that while dying darius had named him as his successor to the achaemenid throne the achaemenid empire is normally considered to have fallen with darius however as basic forms of community life and the general structure of government were maintained and resuscitated by alexander under his own rule he in the words of the iranologist pierre briant may therefore be considered to have acted in many ways as the last of the achaemenids alexander viewed bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him this campaign initially against bessus turned into a grand tour of central asia alexander founded a series of new cities all called alexandria including modern kandahar in afghanistan and alexandria eschate the furthest in modern tajikistan the campaign took alexander through media parthia aria west afghanistan drangiana arachosia south and central afghanistan bactria north and central afghanistan and scythia in 329 bc spitamenes who held an undefined position in the satrapy of sogdiana betrayed bessus to ptolemy one of alexanders trusted companions and bessus was executed however when at some point later alexander was on the jaxartes dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army spitamenes raised sogdiana in revolt alexander personally defeated the scythians at the battle of jaxartes and immediately launched a campaign against spitamenes defeating him in the battle of gabai after the defeat spitamenes was killed by his own men who then sued for peace problems and plots during this time alexander adopted some elements of persian dress and customs at his court notably the custom of proskynesis either a symbolic kissing of the hand or prostration on the ground that persians showed to their social superiors this was one aspect of alexanders broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the iranian upper classes the greeks however regarded the gesture of proskynesis as the province of deities and believed that alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it this cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen and he eventually abandoned it during the long rule of the achaemenids the elite positions in many segments of the empire including the central government the army and the many satrapies were specifically reserved for iranians and to a major degree persian noblemen the latter were in many cases additionally connected through marriage alliances with the royal achaemenid family this created a problem for alexander as to whether he had to make use of the various segments and people that had given the empire its solidity and unity for a lengthy period of time pierre briant explains that alexander realized that it was insufficient to merely exploit the internal contradictions within the imperial system as in asia minor babylonia or egypt he also had to recreate a central government with or without the support of the iranians as early as 334 bc he demonstrated awareness of this when he challenged incumbent king darius iii by appropriating the main elements of the achaemenid monarchys ideology particularly the theme of the king who protects the lands and the peasants alexander wrote a letter in 332 bc to darius iii wherein he argued that he was worthier than darius to succeed to the achaemenid throne however alexanders eventual decision to burn the achaemenid palace at persepolis in conjunction with the major rejection and opposition of the entire persian people made it impracticable for him to pose himself as darius legitimate successor against bessus artaxerxes v however briant adds alexander reasserted his claim to legitimacy as the avenger of darius iii a plot against his life was revealed and one of his officers philotas was executed for failing to alert alexander the death of the son necessitated the death of the father and thus parmenion who had been charged with guarding the treasury at ecbatana was assassinated at alexanders command to prevent attempts at vengeance most infamously alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at granicus cleitus the black during a violent drunken altercation at maracanda modern day samarkand in uzbekistan in which cleitus accused alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially of having forgotten the macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle later in the central asian campaign a second plot against his life was revealed this one instigated by his own royal pages his official historian callisthenes of olynthus was implicated in the plot and in the anabasis of alexander arrian states that callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment and likely died soon after it remains unclear if callisthenes was actually involved in the plot for prior to his accusation he had fallen out of favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis macedon in alexanders absence when alexander set out for asia he left his general antipater an experienced military and political leader and part of philip iis old guard in charge of macedon alexanders sacking of thebes ensured that greece remained quiet during his absence the one exception was a call to arms by spartan king agis iii in 331 bc whom antipater defeated and killed in the battle of megalopolis antipater referred the spartans punishment to the league of corinth which then deferred to alexander who chose to pardon them there was also considerable friction between antipater and olympias and each complained to alexander about the other in general greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during alexanders campaign in asia alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire however alexanders constant demands for troops and the migration of macedonians throughout his empire depleted macedons strength greatly weakening it in the years after alexander and ultimately led to its subjugation by rome after the third macedonian war 171168 bc coinage the conquest by philip ii of pangaeum and then of the island of thasos between 356 and 342 bc brought rich gold and silver mines under macedonian control alexander appears to have introduced a new coinage in cilicia in tarsus after the battle of issus in 333 bc which went on to become the main coinage of the empire alexander minted gold staters silver tetradrachms and drachims and various fractional bronze coins the types of these coins remained constant in his empire the gold series had the head of athena on the obverse and a winged nike victory on the reverse the silver coinage had a beardless head of heracles wearing a lionskin headdress on the obverse and zeus aetophoros eagle bearer enthroned with a scepter in his left hand on the reverse there are both greek and nongreek aspects to this design heracles and zeus were important deities for the macedonians with heracles considered to be the ancestor of the temenid dynasty and zeus the patron of the main macedonian sanctuary dium however the lion was also the symbolic animal of the anatolian god sandas worshipped at tarsus the reverse design of alexanders tetradrachms is closely modelled on the depiction of the god baaltars baal of tarsus on the silver staters minted at tarsus by the persian satrap mazaeus before alexanders conquest alexander did not attempt to impose uniform imperial coinage throughout his new conquests persian coins continued to circulate in all the satrapies of the empire indian campaign forays into the indian subcontinent after the death of spitamenes and his marriage to roxana raoxshna in old iranian to cement relations with his new satrapies alexander turned to the indian subcontinent he invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of gandhara a region presently straddling eastern afghanistan and northern pakistan to come to him and submit to his authority omphis indian name ambhi the ruler of taxila whose kingdom extended from the indus to the hydaspes jhelum complied but the chieftains of some hill clans including the aspasioi and assakenoi sections of the kambojas known in indian texts also as ashvayanas and ashvakayanas refused to submit ambhi hastened to relieve alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents placing himself and all his forces at his disposal alexander not only returned ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of persian robes gold and silver ornaments 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold alexander was emboldened to divide his forces and ambhi assisted hephaestion and perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the indus where it bends at hund supplied their troops with provisions and received alexander himself and his whole army in his capital city of taxila with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality on the subsequent advance of the macedonian king taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the hydaspes after that victory he was sent by alexander in pursuit of porus to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy subsequently however the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of alexander and taxiles after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the hydaspes was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the indus a considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of philip son of machatas and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of alexander himself 323 bc as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at triparadisus 321 bc in the winter of 327326 bc alexander personally led a campaign against the aspasioi of the kunar valley the guraeans of the guraeus valley and the assakenoi of the swat and buner valleys a fierce contest ensued with the aspasioi in which alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart but eventually the aspasioi lost alexander then faced the assakenoi who fought against him from the strongholds of massaga ora and aornos the fort of massaga was reduced after days of bloody fighting in which alexander was seriously wounded in the ankle according to curtius not only did alexander slaughter the entire population of massaga but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble a similar slaughter followed at ora in the aftermath of massaga and ora numerous assakenians fled to the fortress of aornos alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hillfort after four bloody days after aornos alexander crossed the indus and won an epic battle against king porus who ruled a region lying between the hydaspes and the acesines chenab in what is now the punjab in the battle of the hydaspes in 326 bc alexander was impressed by poruss bravery and made him an ally he appointed porus as satrap and added to poruss territory land that he did not previously own towards the southeast up to the hyphasis beas choosing a local helped him control these lands that were distant from greece alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the hydaspes river naming one bucephala in honour of his horse who died around this time the other was nicaea victory thought to be located at the site of modernday mong punjab philostratus the elder in the life of apollonius of tyana writes that in the army of porus there was an elephant who fought bravely against alexanders army and alexander dedicated it to the helios sun and named it ajax because he thought that a great animal deserved a great name the elephant had gold rings around its tusks and an inscription was on them written in greek alexander the son of zeus dedicates ajax to the helios αλεξανδρος ο διος τον αιαντα τωι ηλιωι revolt of the hellenic army east of poruss kingdom near the ganges river was the nanda empire of magadha and further east the gangaridai empire of bengal region of the indian subcontinent fearing the prospect of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning alexanders army mutinied at the hyphasis river beas refusing to march farther east this river thus marks the easternmost extent of alexanders conquests alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther but his general coenus pleaded with him to change his opinion and return the men he said longed to again see their parents their wives and children their homeland alexander eventually agreed and turned south marching along the indus along the way his army conquered the malhi in modernday multan and other indian tribes while besieging the mallian citadel alexander suffered a nearfatal injury when an arrow penetrated his armor and entered his lung alexander sent much of his army to carmania modern southern iran with general craterus and commissioned a fleet to explore the persian gulf shore under his admiral nearchus while he led the rest back to persia through the more difficult southern route along the gedrosian desert and makran alexander reached susa in 324 bc but not before losing many men to the harsh desert last years in persia discovering that many of his satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his absence alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to susa as a gesture of thanks he paid off the debts of his soldiers and announced that he would send overaged and disabled veterans back to macedon led by craterus his troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of opis they refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of persian customs and dress and the introduction of persian officers and soldiers into macedonian units after three days unable to persuade his men to back down alexander gave persians command posts in the army and conferred macedonian military titles upon persian units the macedonians quickly begged forgiveness which alexander accepted and held a great banquet with several thousand of his men in an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his macedonian and persian subjects alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to persian and other noblewomen at susa but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year meanwhile upon his return to persia alexander learned that guards of the tomb of cyrus the great in pasargadae had desecrated it and swiftly executed them alexander admired cyrus the great from an early age reading xenophons cyropaedia which described cyruss heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator during his visit to pasargadae alexander ordered his architect aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of cyruss tomb afterwards alexander travelled to ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the persian treasure there his closest friend hephaestion died of illness or poisoning hephaestions death devastated alexander and he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral pyre in babylon along with a decree for public mourning back in babylon alexander planned a series of new campaigns beginning with an invasion of arabia but he would not have a chance to realize them as he died shortly after hephaestion on the evening of may 29 alexander organized a banquet for his army to celebrate the end of the campaign of india and the onset of the invasion of the arabian peninsula there is a tradition that they would only start serious drinking after everyone was done with their meals but the wine was usually heavily watered death and succession before his death someone asked alexander on who would be his designated successor should he die he responded to the strongest one he may have also added that there would be funeral games to be played after his death on either 10 or 11 june 323 bc alexander died in the palace of nebuchadnezzar ii in babylon at age 32 there are two different versions of alexanders death differing slightly in details plutarchs account is that roughly 14 days before his death alexander entertained admiral nearchus and spent the night and next day drinking with medius of larissa alexander developed a fever which worsened until he was unable to speak the common soldiers anxious about his health were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them in the second account diodorus recounts that alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of heracles followed by 11 days of weakness he did not develop a fever instead dying after some agony arrian also mentioned this as an alternative but plutarch specifically denied this claim given the propensity of the macedonian aristocracy to assassination foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death diodorus plutarch arrian and justin all mentioned the theory that alexander was poisoned justin stated that alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication while both diodorus and arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness the accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating antipater recently removed as macedonian viceroy replaced by craterus as the head of the alleged plot perhaps taking his summons to babylon as a death sentence and having seen the fate of parmenion and philotas antipater purportedly arranged for alexander to be poisoned by his son iollas who was alexanders winepourer there was even a suggestion that aristotle may have participated the strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death such longacting poisons were probably not available however in a 2003 bbc documentary investigating the death of alexander leo schep from the new zealand national poisons centre proposed that the plant white hellebore veratrum album which was known in antiquity may have been used to poison alexander in a 2014 manuscript in the journal clinical toxicology schep suggested alexanders wine was spiked with veratrum album and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the alexander romance veratrum album poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if alexander was poisoned veratrum album offers the most plausible cause another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river styx modernday mavroneri in arcadia greece that contained calicheamicin a dangerous compound produced by bacteria several natural causes diseases have been suggested including malaria and typhoid fever a 1998 article in the new england journal of medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis a 2004 analysis suggested pyogenic infectious spondylitis or meningitis other illnesses fit the symptoms including acute pancreatitis west nile virus and guillainbarré syndrome naturalcause theories also tend to emphasize that alexanders health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds the anguish that alexander felt after hephaestions death may also have contributed to his declining health postdeath events alexanders body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey which was in turn placed in a gold casket according to aelian a seer called aristander foretold that the land where alexander was laid to rest would be happy and unvanquishable forever perhaps more likely the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative while alexanders funeral cortege was on its way to macedon ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to memphis his successor ptolemy ii philadelphus transferred the sarcophagus to alexandria where it remained until at least late antiquity ptolemy ix lathyros one of ptolemys final successors replaced alexanders sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage the 2014 discovery of an enormous tomb in northern greece at amphipolis dating from the time of alexander the great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of alexander this would fit with the intended destination of alexanders funeral cortege however the memorial was found to be dedicated to the dearest friend of alexander the great hephaestion pompey julius caesar and augustus all visited the tomb in alexandria where augustus allegedly accidentally knocked the nose off caligula was said to have taken alexanders breastplate from the tomb for his own use around ad 200 emperor septimius severus closed alexanders tomb to the public his son and successor caracalla a great admirer visited the tomb during his own reign after this details on the fate of the tomb are hazy the socalled alexander sarcophagus discovered near sidon and now in the istanbul archaeology museum is so named not because it was thought to have contained alexanders remains but because its basreliefs depict alexander and his companions fighting the persians and hunting it was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of abdalonymus died 311 bc the king of sidon appointed by alexander immediately following the battle of issus in 331 however in 1969 it was suggested by karl schefold that it may date from earlier than abdalonymuss death demades likened the macedonian army after the death of alexander to the blinded cyclops due to the many random and disorderly movements that it made in addition leosthenes also likened the anarchy between the generals after alexanders death to the blinded cyclops who after he had lost his eye went feeling and groping about with his hands before him not knowing where to lay them division of the macedonian empire alexanders death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached greece they were not immediately believed alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir his son alexander iv by roxane being born after alexanders death according to diodorus alexanders companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom his laconic reply was tôi kratistôito the strongest another theory is that his successors wilfully or erroneously misheard tôi kraterôito craterus the general leading his macedonian troops home and newly entrusted with the regency of macedonia arrian and plutarch claimed that alexander was speechless by this point implying that this was an apocryphal story diodorus curtius and justin offered the more plausible story that alexander passed his signet ring to perdiccas a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry in front of witnesses thereby nominating him perdiccas initially did not claim power instead suggesting that roxanes baby would be king if male with himself craterus leonnatus and antipater as guardians however the infantry under the command of meleager rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion instead they supported alexanders halfbrother philip arrhidaeus eventually the two sides reconciled and after the birth of alexander iv he and philip iii were appointed joint kings albeit in name only dissension and rivalry soon affected the macedonians however the satrapies handed out by perdiccas at the partition of babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power after the assassination of perdiccas in 321 bc macedonian unity collapsed and 40 years of war between the successors diadochi ensued before the hellenistic world settled into three stable power blocs ptolemaic egypt seleucid syria and east and antigonid macedonia in the process both alexander iv and philip iii were murdered last plans diodorus stated that alexander had given detailed written instructions to craterus some time before his death which are known as alexanders last plans craterus started to carry out alexanders commands but the successors chose not to further implement them on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant furthermore perdiccas had read the notebooks containing alexanders last plans to the macedonian troops in babylon who voted not to carry them out according to diodorus alexanders last plans called for military expansion into the southern and western mediterranean monumental constructions and the intermixing of eastern and western populations it included the enormous scale of these plans has led many scholars to doubt their historicity ernst badian argued that they were exaggerated by perdiccas in order to ensure that the macedonian troops voted not to carry them out other scholars have proposed that they were invented by later authors within the tradition of the alexander romance character generalship alexander perhaps earned the epithet the great due to his unparalleled success as a military commander he never lost a battle despite typically being outnumbered this was due to use of terrain phalanx and cavalry tactics bold strategy and the fierce loyalty of his troops the macedonian phalanx armed with the sarissa a spear 6 long had been developed and perfected by philip ii through rigorous training and alexander used its speed and manoeuvrability to great effect against larger but more disparate persian forces alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army which employed various languages and weapons he overcame this by being personally involved in battle in the manner of a macedonian king in his first battle in asia at granicus alexander used only a small part of his forces perhaps 13000 infantry with 5000 cavalry against a much larger persian force of 40000 alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings so that his line matched the length of the persian cavalry line about 3 by contrast the persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry this ensured that alexander would not be outflanked while his phalanx armed with long pikes had a considerable advantage over the persians scimitars and javelins macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the persians at issus in 333 bc his first confrontation with darius he used the same deployment and again the central phalanx pushed through alexander personally led the charge in the center routing the opposing army at the decisive encounter with darius at gaugamela darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes alexander arranged a double phalanx with the center advancing at an angle parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming the advance was successful and broke dariuss center causing the latter to flee once again when faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques such as in central asia and india alexander adapted his forces to his opponents style thus in bactria and sogdiana alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements while massing his cavalry at the center in india confronted by poruss elephant corps the macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants handlers physical appearance historical sources frequently give conflicting accounts of alexanders appearance and the earliest sources are the most scant in their detail during his lifetime alexander carefully curated his image by commissioning works from famous and great artists of the time this included commissioning sculptures by lysippos paintings by apelles and gem engravings by pyrgoteles ancient authors recorded that alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image scholars today however find the claim dubious nevertheless andrew stewart highlights the fact that artistic portraits not least because of who they are commissioned by are always partisan and that artistic portrayals of alexander seek to legitimize him or by extension his successors to interpret him to their audiences to answer their critiques and to persuade them of his greatness and thus should be considered within a framework of praise and blame in the same way sources such as praise poetry are despite those caveats lysipposs sculpture famous for its naturalism as opposed to a stiffer more static pose is thought to be the most faithful depiction curtius rufus a roman historian from the first century ad who wrote the histories of alexander the great gives this account of alexander sitting on the throne of darius iii both curtius and diodorus report a story that when darius iiis mother sisygambis first met alexander and hephaestion she assumed that the latter was alexander because he was the taller and more handsome of the two the greek biographer plutarch 45 discusses the accuracy of his depictions historians have understood the detail of the pleasant odour attributed to alexander as stemming from a belief in ancient greece that pleasant scents are characteristic of gods and heroes the alexander mosaic and contemporary coins portray alexander with a straight nose a slightly protruding jaw full lips and eyes deep set beneath a strongly pronounced forehead he is also described as having a slight upward tilt of his head to the left the ancient historian aelian 175  235 ad in his varia historia 1214 describes alexanders hair color as ξανθὴν xanthín which at the time could mean yellowish brownish or reddish it is sometimes claimed that alexander had one blue and one brown eye referring to the alexander romance however it is a fictional account in the same part of that text it is claimed that alexander had sharp teeth like fangs and did not look like philip or olympias reconstruction based on remaining traces of paint of the original polychromy on his sarcophagus indicates that he was depicted with brown eyes and chestnut brown hair personality both of alexanders parents encouraged his ambitions his father philip was probably alexanders most immediate and influential role model as the young alexander watched him campaign practically every year winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds alexanders relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality he had a need to outdo his father illustrated by his reckless behavior in battle while alexander worried that his father would leave him no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world he also downplayed his fathers achievements to his companions alexanders mother olympia similarly had huge ambitions and encouraged her son to believe it was his destiny to conquer the persian empire she instilled a sense of destiny in him and plutarch tells how his ambition kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years according to plutarch alexander also had a violent temper and rash impulsive nature and this could influence his decision making although alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father he was open to reasoned debate he had a calmer sideperceptive logical and calculating he had a great desire for knowledge a love for philosophy and was an avid reader this was no doubt in part due to aristotles tutelage alexander was intelligent and quick to learn his intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general he had great selfrestraint in pleasures of the body in contrast with his lack of selfcontrol with alcohol alexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences however he had little interest in sports or the olympic games unlike his father seeking only the homeric ideals of honour timê and glory kudos he had great charisma and force of personality characteristics which made him a great leader his unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite macedonia and retain the empire after his deathonly alexander had the ability to do so during his final years and especially after the death of hephaestion alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia his extraordinary achievements coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions may have combined to produce this effect his delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world in as much as he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition an epithet the meaning of which has descended into a historical cliché he appears to have believed himself a deity or at least sought to deify himself olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of zeus a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of amun at siwa he began to identify himself as the son of zeusammon alexander adopted elements of persian dress and customs at court notably proskynesis which was one aspect of alexanders broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the iranian upper classes however the practise of proskynesis was disapproved by the macedonians and they were unwilling to perform it this behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen however alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples many of whom lived in societies where the king was treated as divine thus rather than megalomania his behaviour may have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together personal relationships alexander married three times roxana daughter of the sogdian nobleman oxyartes of bactria out of love and the persian princesses stateira and parysatis the former a daughter of darius iii and the latter a daughter of artaxerxes iii for political reasons he apparently had two sons alexander iv of macedon by roxana and possibly heracles of macedon from his mistress barsine he lost another child when roxana miscarried at babylon alexander also had a close relationship with his friend general and bodyguard hephaestion the son of a macedonian noble hephaestions death devastated alexander this event may have contributed to alexanders failing health and detached mental state during his final months sexuality alexanders sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy in modern times the roman era writer athenaeus says based on the scholar dicaearchus who was alexanders contemporary that the king was quite excessively keen on boys and that alexander kissed the eunuch bagoas in public this episode is also told by plutarch probably based on the same source none of alexanders contemporaries however are known to have explicitly described alexanders relationship with hephaestion as sexual though the pair was often compared to achilles and patroclus who are often interpreted as a couple aelian writes of alexanders visit to troy where alexander garlanded the tomb of achilles and hephaestion that of patroclus the latter hinting that he was a beloved of alexander in just the same way as patroclus was of achilles some modern historians eg robin lane fox believe not only that alexanders youthful relationship with hephaestion was sexual but that their sexual contacts may have continued into adulthood which went against the social norms of at least some greek cities such as athens though some modern researchers have tentatively proposed that macedonia or at least the macedonian court may have been more tolerant of homosexuality between adults green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that alexander had much carnal interest in women he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life however ogden calculates that alexander who impregnated his partners thrice in eight years had a higher matrimonial record than his father at the same age two of these pregnanciesstateiras and barsinesare of dubious legitimacy according to diodorus siculus alexander accumulated a harem in the style of persian kings but he used it rather sparingly not wishing to offend the macedonians showing great selfcontrol in pleasures of the body nevertheless plutarch described how alexander was infatuated by roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her green suggested that in the context of the period alexander formed quite strong friendships with women including ada of caria who adopted him and even dariuss mother sisygambis who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of alexanders death battle record legacy alexanders legacy extended beyond his military conquests and his reign marked a turning point in european and asian history his campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between east and west and vast areas to the east were significantly exposed to greek civilization and influence some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers many surviving into the 21st century his chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched while the greeks themselves got a sense of belonging to a world beyond the mediterranean hellenistic kingdoms alexanders most immediate legacy was the introduction of macedonian rule to huge new swathes of asia at the time of his death alexanders empire covered some 5200000 and was the largest state of its time many of these areas remained in macedonian hands or under greek influence for the next 200300 years the successor states that emerged were at least initially dominant forces and these 300 years are often referred to as the hellenistic period the eastern borders of alexanders empire began to collapse even during his lifetime however the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful indian dynasties in history the maurya empire taking advantage of this power vacuum chandragupta maurya referred to in greek sources as sandrokottos of relatively humble origin took control of the punjab and with that power base proceeded to conquer the nanda empire founding of cities over the course of his conquests alexander founded many cities that bore his name most of them east of the tigris the first and greatest was alexandria in egypt which would become one of the leading mediterranean cities the cities locations reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions at first the cities must have been inhospitable little more than defensive garrisons following alexanders death many greeks who had settled there tried to return to greece however a century or so after alexanders death many of the alexandrias were thriving with elaborate public buildings and substantial populations that included both greek and local peoples funding of temples in 334 bc alexander the great donated funds for the completion of the new temple of athena polias in priene in modernday western turkey an inscription from the temple now housed in the british museum declares king alexander dedicated temple to athena polias this inscription is one of the few independent archaeological discoveries confirming an episode from alexanders life the temple was designed by pytheos one of the architects of the mausoleum at halicarnassus libanius wrote that alexander founded the temple of zeus bottiaios βοττιαίου δῖός in the place where later the city of antioch was built suda wrote that alexander built a big temple to sarapis in 2023 british museum experts have suggested the possibility that a greek temple at girsu in iraq was founded by alexander according to the researchers recent discoveries suggest that this site honours zeus and two divine sons the sons are heracles and alexander hellenization hellenization was coined by the german historian johann gustav droysen to denote the spread of greek language culture and population into the former persian empire after alexanders conquest this process can be seen in such great hellenistic cities as alexandria antioch and seleucia south of modern baghdad alexander sought to insert greek elements into persian culture and to hybridize greek and persian culture homogenizing the populations of asia and europe although his successors explicitly rejected such policies hellenization occurred throughout the region accompanied by a distinct and opposite orientalization of the successor states the core of the hellenistic culture promulgated by the conquests was essentially athenian the close association of men from across greece in alexanders army directly led to the emergence of the largely atticbased koine or common greek dialect koine spread throughout the hellenistic world becoming the lingua franca of hellenistic lands and eventually the ancestor of modern greek furthermore town planning education local government and art current in the hellenistic period were all based on classical greek ideals evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as hellenistic also the new testament was written in the koine greek language aspects of hellenistic culture were still evident in the traditions of the byzantine empire in the mid15th century hellenization in south and central asia some of the most pronounced effects of hellenization can be seen in afghanistan and india in the region of the relatively laterising grecobactrian kingdom 250125 bc in modern afghanistan pakistan and tajikistan and the indogreek kingdom 180 bc  10 ad in modern afghanistan and india on the silk road trade routes hellenistic culture hybridized with iranian and buddhist cultures the cosmopolitan art and mythology of gandhara a region spanning the upper confluence of the indus swat and kabul rivers in modern pakistan of the 3rd century bc to the 5th century ad are most evident of the direct contact between hellenistic civilization and south asia as are the edicts of ashoka which directly mention the greeks within ashokas dominion as converting to buddhism and the reception of buddhist emissaries by ashokas contemporaries in the hellenistic world the resulting syncretism known as grecobuddhism influenced the development of buddhism and created a culture of grecobuddhist art these grecobuddhist kingdoms sent some of the first buddhist missionaries to china sri lanka and hellenistic asia and europe grecobuddhist monasticism some of the first and most influential figurative portrayals of the buddha appeared at this time perhaps modelled on greek statues of apollo in the grecobuddhist style several buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient greek religion the concept of boddhisatvas is reminiscent of greek divine heroes and some mahayana ceremonial practices burning incense gifts of flowers and food placed on altars are similar to those practised by the ancient greeks however similar practices were also observed amongst the native indic culture one greek king menander i probably became buddhist and was immortalized in buddhist literature as milinda the process of hellenization also spurred trade between the east and west for example greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century bc were found in the grecobactrian city of ai khanoum in modernday afghanistan while the greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the longstanding indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain mount meru like the petals of a flower the yavanajataka lit greek astronomical treatise and paulisa siddhanta texts depict the influence of greek astronomical ideas on indian astronomy following the conquests of alexander the great in the east hellenistic influence on indian art was farranging in the area of architecture a few examples of the ionic order can be found as far as pakistan with the jandial temple near taxila several examples of capitals displaying ionic influences can be seen as far as patna especially with the pataliputra capital dated to the 3rd century bc the corinthian order is also heavily represented in the art of gandhara especially through indocorinthian capitals influence on rome alexander and his exploits were admired by many romans especially generals who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements polybius began his histories by reminding romans of alexanders achievements and thereafter roman leaders saw him as a role model pompey the great adopted the epithet magnus and even alexanders anastoletype haircut and searched the conquered lands of the east for alexanders 260yearold cloak which he then wore as a sign of greatness julius caesar dedicated a lysippean equestrian bronze statue but replaced alexanders head with his own while octavian visited alexanders tomb in alexandria and temporarily changed his seal from a sphinx to alexanders profile the emperor trajan also admired alexander as did nero and caracalla the macriani a roman family that in the person of macrinus briefly ascended to the imperial throne kept images of alexander on their persons either on jewellery or embroidered into their clothes on the other hand some roman writers particularly republican figures used alexander as a cautionary tale of how autocratic tendencies can be kept in check by republican values alexander was used by these writers as an example of ruler values such as amicita friendship and clementia clemency but also iracundia anger and cupiditas gloriae overdesire for glory emperor julian in his satire called the caesars describes a contest between the previous roman emperors with alexander the great called in as an extra contestant in the presence of the assembled gods the itinerarium alexandri is a 4thcentury latin description of alexander the greats campaigns julius caesar went to serve his quaestorship in hispania after his wifes funeral in the spring or early summer of 69 bc while there he encountered a statue of alexander the great and realised with dissatisfaction that he was now at an age when alexander had the world at his feet while he had achieved comparatively little pompey posed as the new alexander since he was his boyhood hero after caracalla concluded his campaign against the alamanni it became evident that he was inordinately preoccupied with alexander the great he began openly mimicking alexander in his personal style in planning his invasion of the parthian empire caracalla decided to arrange 16000 of his men in macedonianstyle phalanxes despite the roman army having made the phalanx an obsolete tactical formation the historian christopher matthew mentions that the term phalangarii has two possible meanings both with military connotations the first refers merely to the roman battle line and does not specifically mean that the men were armed with pikes and the second bears similarity to the marian mules of the late roman republic who carried their equipment suspended from a long pole which were in use until at least the 2nd century ad as a consequence the phalangarii of legio ii parthica may not have been pikemen but rather standard battle line troops or possibly triarii caracallas mania for alexander went so far that caracalla visited alexandria while preparing for his persian invasion and persecuted philosophers of the aristotelian school based on a legend that aristotle had poisoned alexander this was a sign of caracallas increasingly erratic behaviour but this mania for alexander strange as it was was overshadowed by subsequent events in alexandria in 39 caligula performed a spectacular stunt by ordering a temporary floating bridge to be built using ships as pontoons stretching for over two miles from the resort of baiae to the neighbouring port of puteoli it was said that the bridge was to rival the persian king xerxes pontoon bridge crossing of the hellespont caligula who could not swim then proceeded to ride his favourite horse incitatus across wearing the breastplate of alexander the great this act was in defiance of a prediction by tiberiuss soothsayer thrasyllus of mendes that caligula had no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the bay of baiae the diffusion of greek culture and language cemented by alexanders conquests in west asia and north africa served as a precondition for the later roman expansion into these territories and entire basis for the byzantine empire according to errington letters alexander wrote and received numerous letters but no originals survive a few official letters addressed to the greek cities survive in copies inscribed in stone and the content of others is sometimes reported in historical sources these only occasionally quote the letters and it is an open question how reliable such quotations are several fictitious letters some perhaps based on actual letters made their way into the romance tradition in legend many of the legends about alexander derive from his own lifetime probably encouraged by alexander himself his court historian callisthenes portrayed the sea in cilicia as drawing back from him in proskynesis writing shortly after alexanders death onesicritus invented a tryst between alexander and thalestris queen of the mythical amazons he reportedly read this passage to his patron king lysimachus who had been one of alexanders generals and who quipped i wonder where i was at the time in the first centuries after alexanders death probably in alexandria a quantity of the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the alexander romance later falsely ascribed to callisthenes and therefore known as pseudocallisthenes this text underwent over one hundred recensions translations and derivations throughout the islamic and european worlds in premodern times containing many dubious stories and was translated into twentyfive languages for example middle persian syriac and arabic in ancient and modern culture alexander the greats accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures alexander has figured in both high and popular culture beginning in his own era to the present day the alexander romance in particular has had a significant impact on portrayals of alexander in later cultures from persian to medieval european to modern greek alexander features prominently in modern greek folklore more so than any other ancient figure the colloquial form of his name in modern greek o megalexandros is a household name and he is the only ancient hero to appear in the karagiozis shadow play one wellknown fable among greek seamen involves a solitary mermaid who would grasp a ships prow during a storm and ask the captain is king alexander alive the correct answer is he is alive and well and rules the world causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm any other answer would cause the mermaid to turn into a raging gorgon who would drag the ship to the bottom of the sea all hands aboard in preislamic middle persian zoroastrian literature alexander is referred to by the epithet gujastak meaning accursed and is accused of destroying temples and burning the sacred texts of zoroastrianism in islamic persia under the influence of the alexander romance in اسکندرنامه iskandarnameh a more positive portrayal of alexander emerges firdausis shahnameh the book of kings includes alexander in a line of legitimate persian shahs a mythical figure who explored the far reaches of the world in search of the fountain of youth in the shahnameh alexanders first journey is to mecca to pray at the kaaba alexander was depicted as performing a hajj pilgrimage to mecca many times in subsequent islamic art and literature later persian writers associate him with philosophy portraying him at a symposium with figures such as socrates plato and aristotle in search of immortality the figure of dhu alqarnayn arabic ذو القرنين lit the twohorned one is believed by the majority of modern researchers of the quran as well as islamic commentators to be a reference to alexander the figure is also believed by scholars to be based on later legends of alexander in this tradition he was a heroic figure who built a wall to defend against the nations of gog and magog he also travelled the known world in search of the water of life and immortality eventually becoming a prophet the syriac version of the alexander romance portrays him as an ideal christian world conqueror who prayed to the one true god in egypt alexander was portrayed as the son of nectanebo ii the last pharaoh before the persian conquest his defeat of darius was depicted as egypts salvation proving egypt was still ruled by an egyptian according to josephus alexander was shown the book of daniel when he entered jerusalem which described a mighty greek king who would conquer the persian empire this is cited as a reason for sparing jerusalem in hindi and urdu the name sikandar derived from the persian name for alexander denotes a rising young talent and the delhi sultanate ruler alauddin khalji stylized himself as sikandarisani the second alexander the great in medieval india turkic and afghan sovereigns from the iraniancultured region of central asia brought positive cultural connotations of alexander to the indian subcontinent resulting in the efflorescence of sikandernameh alexander romances written by indopersian poets such as amir khusrau and the prominence of alexander the great as a popular subject in mughalera persian miniatures in medieval europe alexander the great was revered as a member of the nine worthies a group of heroes whose lives were believed to encapsulate all the ideal qualities of chivalry during the first italian campaign of the french revolutionary wars in a question from bourrienne asking whether he gave his preference to alexander or caesar napoleon said that he places alexander the great in the first rank the main reason being his campaign on asia in the greek anthology there are poems referring to alexander throughout time art objects related to alexander were being created in addition to speech works sculptures and paintings in modern times alexander is still the subject of musical and cinematic works the song alexander the great by the british heavy metal band iron maiden is indicative some films that have been shot with the theme of alexander are there are also many references to other movies and tv series newer novels about alexander are the trilogy alexander the great by valerio massimo manfredi consisting of the son of the dream the sand of amon and the ends of the world the trilogy of mary renault consisting of fire from heaven the persian boy and funeral games irish playwright aubrey thomas de vere wrote alexander the great a dramatic poem historiography apart from a few inscriptions and fragments texts written by people who actually knew alexander or who gathered information from men who served with alexander were all lost contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included alexanders campaign historian callisthenes alexanders generals ptolemy and nearchus aristobulus a junior officer on the campaigns and onesicritus alexanders chief helmsman their works are lost but later works based on these original sources have survived the earliest of these is diodorus siculus 1st century bc followed by quintus curtius rufus midtolate 1st century ad arrian 1st to 2nd century ad the biographer plutarch 1st to 2nd century ad and finally justin whose work dated as late as the 4th century of these arrian is generally considered the most reliable given that he used ptolemy and aristobulus as his sources closely followed by diodorus see also references

ˈalfrɛt kɔˈʐɨpskʲi july 3 1879  march 1 1950 was a polishamerican independent scholar who developed a field called general semantics which he viewed as both distinct from and more encompassing than the field of semantics he argued that human knowledge of the world is limited both by the human nervous system and the languages humans have developed and thus no one can have direct access to reality given that the most we can know is that which is filtered through the brains responses to reality his best known dictum is the map is not the territory early life and career born in warsaw vistula country which was then part of the russian empire korzybski belonged to an aristocratic polish family whose members had worked as mathematicians scientists and engineers for generations he learned the polish language at home and the russian language in schools and having a french and german governess he became fluent in four languages as a child korzybski studied engineering at the warsaw university of technology during the first world war 19141918 korzybski served as an intelligence officer in the russian army after being wounded in a leg and suffering other injuries he moved to north america in 1916 first to canada then to the united states to coordinate the shipment of artillery to russia he also lectured to polishamerican audiences about the conflict promoting the sale of war bonds after the war he decided to remain in the united states becoming a naturalized citizen in 1940 he met mira edgerly a painter of portraits on ivory shortly after the 1918 armistice they married in january 1919 the marriage lasted until his death e p dutton published korzybskis first book manhood of humanity in 1921 in this work he proposed and explained in detail a new theory of humankind mankind as a timebinding class of life humans perform time binding by the transmission of knowledge and abstractions through time which become accreted in cultures in 1925 and 1926 korzybski observed psychiatric patients at st elizabeths hospital in dc under the supervision of william alanson white general semantics korzybskis work culminated in the initiation of a discipline that he named general semantics gs this should not be confused with semantics the basic principles of general semantics which include timebinding are described in the publication science and sanity published in 1933 in 1938 korzybski founded the institute of general semantics in chicago the postworld war ii housing shortage in chicago cost him the institutes building lease so in 1946 he moved the institute to lakeville connecticut us where he directed it until his death in 1950 korzybski maintained that humans are limited in what they know by 1 the structure of their nervous systems and 2 the structure of their languages humans cannot experience the world directly but only through their abstractions nonverbal impressions or gleanings derived from the nervous system and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language these sometimes mislead us about what is the truth our understanding sometimes lacks similarity of structure with what is actually happening he sought to train our awareness of abstracting using techniques he had derived from his study of mathematics and science he called this awareness this goal of his system consciousness of abstracting his system included the promotion of attitudes such as i dont know lets see in order that we may better discover or reflect on its realities as revealed by modern science another technique involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet an experience he termed silence on the objective levels to be many devotees and critics of korzybski reduced his rather complex system to a simple matter of what he said about the verb form is of the general verb to be his system however is based primarily on such terminology as the different orders of abstraction and formulations such as consciousness of abstracting the contention that korzybski opposed the use of the verb to be would be a profound exaggeration he thought that certain uses of the verb to be called the is of identity and the is of predication were faulty in structure eg a statement such as elizabeth is a fool said of a person named elizabeth who has done something that we regard as foolish in korzybskis system ones assessment of elizabeth belongs to a higher order of abstraction than elizabeth herself korzybskis remedy was to deny identity in this example to be aware continually that elizabeth is not what we call her we find elizabeth not in the verbal domain the world of words but the nonverbal domain the two he said amount to different orders of abstraction this was expressed by korzybskis most famous premise the map is not the territory note that this premise uses the phrase is not a form of to be this and many other examples show that he did not intend to abandon to be as such in fact he said explicitlyseptember 2012 that there were no structural problems with the verb to be when used as an auxiliary verb or when used to state existence or location it was even acceptable at times to use the faulty forms of the verb to be as long as one was aware of their structural limitations anecdotes one day korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits wrapped in white paper from his briefcase he muttered that he just had to eat something and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like a biscuit a few students took a biscuit nice biscuit dont you think said korzybski while he took a second one the students were chewing vigorously then he tore the white paper from the biscuits in order to reveal the original packaging on it was a big picture of a dogs head and the words dog cookies the students looked at the package and were shocked two of them wanted to vomit put their hands in front of their mouths and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet you see korzybski remarked i have just demonstrated that people dont just eat food but also words and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter william burroughs went to a korzybski workshop in the autumn of 1939 he was 25 years old and paid 40 his fellow studentsthere were 38 in allincluded young samuel i hayakawa later to become a republican member of the us senate and wendell johnson founder of the monster study influence korzybskis work received positive reactions from a variety of individuals in the 1940s and 1950s robert a heinlein named a character after him in his 1940 short story blowups happen and science fiction writer a e van vogt in his novel the world of nulla published in 1948 on march 8 1949 fellow sciencefiction author l ron hubbard wrote to heinlein referencing kozybski as an influence on what would become dianetics korzybskis ideas influenced philosopher alan watts who used his phrase the map is not the territory in lectures writer robert anton wilson was also deeply influenced by korzybskis ideas as reported in the third edition of science and sanity in world war ii the us army used korzybskis system to treat battle fatigue in europe under the supervision of dr douglas m kelley who went on to become the psychiatrist in charge of the nazi war criminals at nuremberg some of the

vector arcade video games video games developed in the united states asteroids is a spacethemed multidirectional shooter arcade video game designed by lyle rains and ed logg released in november 1979 by atari inc the player controls a single spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers the object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers counterfire the game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases asteroids was conceived during a meeting between logg and rains who decided to use hardware developed by howard delman previously used for lunar lander asteroids was based on an unfinished game titled cosmos its physics model control scheme and gameplay elements were derived from spacewar computer space and space invaders and refined through trial and error the game is rendered on a vector display in a twodimensional view that wraps around both screen axes asteroids was one of the first major hits of the golden age of arcade games the game sold 47840 upright cabinets and 8725 cocktail cabinets arcade cabinets and proved both popular with players and influential with developers in the 1980s it was ported to ataris home systems and the atari vcs version sold over three million copies the game was widely imitated and it directly influenced defender gravitar and many other video games gameplay the objective of asteroids is to destroy asteroids and saucers the player controls a triangular ship that can rotate left and right fire shots straight forward and thrust forward once the ship begins moving in a direction it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction the ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting the player can also send the ship into hyperspace causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen at the risk of selfdestructing or appearing on top of an asteroid each level starts with a few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen objects wrap around screen edges  for instance an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction as the player shoots asteroids they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit smaller asteroids are also worth more points two flying saucers appear periodically on the screen the big saucer shoots randomly and poorly while the small saucer fires frequently at the ship after reaching a score of 40000 only the small saucer appears as the players score increases the angle range of the shots from the small saucer diminishes until the saucer fires extremely accurately once the screen has been cleared of all asteroids and flying saucers a new set of large asteroids appears thus starting the next level the game gets harder as the number of asteroids increases until after the score reaches a range between 40000 and 60000 the player starts with 35 lives upon game start and gains an extra life per 10000 points play continues to the last ship lost which ends the game the machine turns over at 99990 points which is the maximum high score that can be achieved lurking exploit in the original game design saucers were supposed to begin shooting as soon as they appeared but this was changed additionally saucers can only aim at the players ship onscreen they are not capable of aiming across a screen boundary these behaviors allow a lurking strategy in which the player stays near the edge of the screen opposite the saucer by keeping just one or two rocks in play a player can shoot across the boundary and destroy saucers to accumulate points indefinitely with little risk of being destroyed arcade operators began to complain about losing revenue due to this exploit in response atari issued a patched eprom and due to the impact of this exploit atari and other companies changed their development and testing policies to try to prevent future games from having such exploits development concept asteroids was conceived by lyle rains and programmed by ed logg with collaborations from other atari staff logg was impressed with the atari video computer system later called the atari 2600 and he joined ataris coinop division to work on dirt bike which was never released due to an unsuccessful field test paul mancuso joined the development team as asteroids technician and engineer howard delman contributed to the hardware during a meeting in april 1979 rains discussed planet grab a multiplayer arcade game later renamed to cosmos logg did not know the name of the game thinking computer space as the inspiration for the twodimensional approach rains conceived of asteroids as a mixture of computer space and space invaders combining the twodimensional approach of computer space with space invaders addictive gameplay of completion and eliminate all threats the unfinished game featured a giant indestructible asteroid so rains asked logg well why dont we have a game where you shoot the rocks and blow them up in response logg described a similar concept where the player selectively shoots at rocks that break into smaller pieces both agreed on the concept hardware asteroids was implemented on hardware developed by delman and is a vector game in which the graphics are composed of lines drawn on a vector monitor rains initially wanted the game done in raster graphics but logg experienced in vector graphics suggested an xy monitor because the high image quality would permit precise aiming the hardware is chiefly a mos 6502 executing the game program and quadrascan a highresolution vector graphics processor developed by atari and referred to as an xy display system and the digital vector generator dvg the original design concepts for quadrascan came out of cyan engineering ataris offcampus research lab in grass valley california in 1978 cyan gave it to delman who finished the design and first used it for lunar lander logg received delmans modified board with five buttons 13 sound effects and additional ram and he used it to develop asteroids the size of the board was 4 by 4 inches and it was linked up to a monitor implementation logg modeled the players ship the fivebutton control scheme and the game physics after spacewar which he had played as a student at the university of california berkeley but made several changes to improve playability the ship was programmed into the hardware and rendered by the monitor and it was configured to move with thrust and inertia the hyperspace button was not placed near loggs right thumb which he was dissatisfied with as he had a problem taking his hand off the thrust button drawings of asteroids in various shapes were incorporated into the game logg copied the idea of a high score table with initials from exidys star fire the two saucers were formulated to be different from each other a steadily decreasing timer shortens intervals between saucer attacks to keep the player from not shooting asteroids and saucers a heartbeat soundtrack quickens as the game progresses the game does not have a sound chip delman created a hardware circuit for 13 sound effects by hand which was wired onto the board a prototype of asteroids was well received by several atari staff and engineers who wandered between labs passing comment and stopping to play as they went logg was often asked when he would be leaving by employees eager to play the prototype so he created a second prototype for staff to play atari tested the game in arcades in sacramento california and also observed players during focus group sessions at atari players used to spacewar struggled to maintain grip on the thrust button and requested a joystick players accustomed to space invaders noted they get no break in the game logg and other engineers observed proceedings and documented comments in four pages asteroids slows down as the player gains 50100 lives because there is no limit to the number of lives displayed the player can lose the game after more than 250 lives are collected ports asteroids was released for the atari vcs later renamed the atari 2600 and atari 8bit family in 1981 then the atari 7800 in 1986 a port for the atari 5200 identical to the atari 8bit computer version was in development in 1982 but was not published the atari 7800 version was a launch title and includes cooperative play the asteroids have colorful textures and the heartbeat sound effect remains intact programmers brad stewart and bob smith were unable to fit the atari vcs port into a 4 kb cartridge it became the first game for the console to use bank switching a technique that increases rom size from 4 kb to 8 kb reception asteroids was immediately successful upon release it displaced space invaders by popularity in the united states and became ataris best selling arcade game of all time with over 70000 units sold atari earned an estimated 150 million in sales from the game and arcade operators earned a further 500 million from coin drops atari had been in the process of manufacturing another vector game lunar lander but demand for asteroids was so high that several hundred asteroids games were shipped in lunar lander cabinets asteroids was so popular that some video arcade operators had to install large boxes to hold the number of coins spent by players it replaced space invaders at the top of the us replay amusement arcade charts in april 1980 though space invaders remained the top game at street locations asteroids went on to become the highestgrossing arcade video game of 1980 in the united states dethroning space invaders it shipped 70000 arcade units worldwide in 1980 including over 60000 sold in the united states that year and grossed about 700 million worldwide us billion adjusted for inflation by 1980 the game remained at the top of the us replay charts through march 1981 the game did not perform as well overseas in europe and asia it sold 30000 arcade units overseas for a total of 100000 arcade units sold worldwide atari manufactured 76312 units from its us and ireland plants including 21394 asteroids deluxe units it was a commercial failure in japan when it released there in 1980 partly due to its complex controls and partly due to the japanese market beginning to lose interest in space shoot em ups at the time asteroids received positive reviews from video game critics and has been regarded as loggs magnum opus richard a edwards reviewed the 1981 asteroids home cartridge in the space gamer no 46 edwards commented that this home cartridge is a virtual

first appearances asparagales asparagoid lilies is an order of plants in modern classification systems such as the angiosperm phylogeny group apg and the angiosperm phylogeny web the order takes its name from the type family asparagaceae and is placed in the monocots amongst the lilioid monocots the order has only recently been recognized in classification systems it was first put forward by huber in 1977 and later taken up in the dahlgren system of 1985 and then the apg in 1998 2003 and 2009 before this many of its families were assigned to the old order liliales a very large order containing almost all monocots with colorful tepals and lacking starch in their endosperm dna sequence analysis indicated that many of the taxa previously included in liliales should actually be redistributed over three orders liliales asparagales and dioscoreales the boundaries of the asparagales and of its families have undergone a series of changes in recent years future research may lead to further changes and ultimately greater stability in the apg circumscription asparagales is the largest order of monocots with 14 families 1122 genera and about 36000 species the order is clearly circumscribed on the basis of molecular phylogenetics but it is difficult to define morphologically since its members are structurally diverse most species of asparagales are herbaceous perennials although some are climbers and some are trees or shrubs the order also contains many geophytes bulbs corms and various kinds of tuber according to telomere sequence at least two evolutionary switchpoints happened within the order the basal sequence is formed by tttaggg like in the majority of higher plants basal motif was changed to vertebratelike ttaggg and finally the most divergent motif ctcggttatggg appears in allium one of the defining characteristics synapomorphies of the order is the presence of phytomelanin a black pigment present in the seed coat creating a dark crust phytomelanin is found in most families of the asparagales although not in orchidaceae thought to be the sistergroup of the rest of the order the leaves of almost all species form a tight rosette either at the base of the plant or at the end of the stem but occasionally along the stem the flowers are not particularly distinctive being lily type with six tepals and up to six stamina the order is thought to have first diverged from other related monocots some 120130 million years ago early in the cretaceous period although given the difficulty in classifying the families involved estimates are likely to be uncertain from an economic point of view the order asparagales is second in importance within the monocots only to the order poales which includes grasses and cereals species are used as food and flavourings eg onion garlic leek asparagus vanilla saffron in medicinal or cosmetic applications aloe as cut flowers eg freesia gladiolus iris orchids and as garden ornamentals eg day lilies lily of the valley agapanthus description although most species in the order are herbaceous some no more than 15 cm high there are a number of climbers eg some species of asparagus as well as several genera forming trees eg agave cordyline yucca dracaena aloe  which can exceed 10 m in height succulent genera occur in several families eg aloe almost all species have a tight cluster of leaves a rosette either at the base of the plant or at the end of a moreorless woody stem as with yucca in some cases the leaves are produced along the stem the flowers are in the main not particularly distinctive being of a general lily type with six tepals either free or fused from the base and up to six stamina they are frequently clustered at the end of the plant stem the asparagales are generally distinguished from the liliales by the lack of markings on the tepals the presence of septal nectaries in the ovaries rather than the bases of the tepals or stamen filaments and the presence of secondary growth they are generally geophytes but with linear leaves and a lack of fine reticular venation the seeds characteristically have the external epidermis either obliterated in most species bearing fleshy fruit or if present have a layer of black carbonaceous phytomelanin in species with dry fruits nuts the inner part of the seed coat is generally collapsed in contrast to liliales whose seeds have a well developed outer epidermis lack phytomelanin and usually display a cellular inner layer the orders which have been separated from the old liliales are difficult to characterize no single morphological character appears to be diagnostic of the order asparagales taxonomy as circumscribed within the angiosperm phylogeny group system asparagales is the largest order within the monocotyledons with 14 families 1122 genera and about 2500042000 species thus accounting for about 50 of all monocots and 1015 of the flowering plants angiosperms the attribution of botanical authority for the name asparagales belongs to johann heinrich friedrich link 17671851 who coined the word asparaginae in 1829 for a higher order taxon that included asparagus although adanson and jussieau had also done so earlier see history earlier circumscriptions of asparagales attributed the name to bromhead 1838 who had been the first to use the term asparagales history predarwinian the type genus asparagus from which the name of the order is derived was described by carl linnaeus in 1753 with ten species he placed asparagus within the hexandria monogynia six stamens one carpel in his sexual classification in the species plantarum the majority of taxa now considered to constitute asparagales have historically been placed within the very large and diverse family liliaceae the family liliaceae was first described by michel adanson in 1763 and in his taxonomic scheme he created eight sections within it including the asparagi with asparagus and three other genera the system of organising genera into families is generally credited to antoine laurent de jussieu who formally described both the liliaceae and the type family of asparagales the asparagaceae as lilia and asparagi respectively in 1789 jussieu established the hierarchical system of taxonomy phylogeny placing asparagus and related genera within a division of monocotyledons a class iii of stamina perigynia and order asparagi divided into three subfamilies the use of the term ordo order at that time was closer to what we now understand as family rather than order in creating his scheme he used a modified form of linnaeus sexual classification but using the respective topography of stamens to carpels rather than just their numbers while de jussieus stamina perigynia also included a number of orders that would eventually form families within the asparagales such as the asphodeli asphodelaceae narcissi amaryllidaceae and irides iridaceae the remainder are now allocated to other orders jussieus asparagi soon came to be referred to as asparagacées in the french literature latin asparagaceae meanwhile the narcissi had been renamed as the amaryllidées amaryllideae in 1805 by jean henri jaume sainthilaire using amaryllis as the type species rather than narcissus and thus has the authority attribution for amaryllidaceae in 1810 brown proposed that a subgroup of liliaceae be distinguished on the basis of the position of the ovaries and be referred to as amaryllideae and in 1813 de candolle described liliacées juss and amaryllidées brown as two quite separate families the literature on the organisation of genera into families and higher ranks became available in the english language with samuel frederick grays a natural arrangement of british plants 1821 gray used a combination of linnaeus sexual classification and jussieus natural classification to group together a number of families having in common six equal stamens a single style and a perianth that was simple and petaloid but did not use formal names for these higher ranks within the grouping he separated families by the characteristics of their fruit and seed he treated groups of genera with these characteristics as separate families such as amaryllideae liliaceae asphodeleae and asparageae the circumscription of asparagales has been a source of difficulty for many botanists from the time of john lindley 1846 the other important british taxonomist of the early nineteenth century in his first taxonomic work an introduction to the natural system of botany 1830 he partly followed jussieu by describing a subclass he called endogenae or monocotyledonous plants preserving de candolles endogenæ phanerogamæ divided into two tribes the petaloidea and glumaceae he divided the former often referred to as petaloid monocots into 32 orders including the liliaceae defined narrowly but also most of the families considered to make up the asparagales today including the amaryllideae by 1846 in his final scheme lindley had greatly expanded and refined the treatment of the monocots introducing both an intermediate ranking alliances and tribes within orders ie families lindley placed the liliaceae within the liliales but saw it as a paraphyletic catchall family being all liliales not included in the other orders but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better the order liliales was very large and included almost all monocotyledons with colourful tepals and without starch in their endosperm the lilioid monocots the liliales was difficult to divide into families because morphological characters were not present in patterns that clearly demarcated groups this kept the liliaceae separate from the amaryllidaceae narcissales of these liliaceae was divided into eleven tribes with 133 genera and amaryllidaceae into four tribes with 68 genera yet both contained many genera that would eventually segregate to each others contemporary orders liliales and asparagales respectively the liliaceae would be reduced to a small core represented by the tribe tulipae while large groups such scilleae and asparagae would become part of asparagales either as part of the amaryllidaceae or as separate families while of the amaryllidaceae the agaveae would be part of asparagaceae but the alstroemeriae would become a family within the liliales the number of known genera and species continued to grow and by the time of the next major british classification that of the bentham  hooker system in 1883 published in latin several of lindleys other families had been absorbed into the liliaceae they used the term series to indicate suprafamilial rank with seven series of monocotyledons including glumaceae but did not use lindleys terms for these however they did place the liliaceous and amaryllidaceous genera into separate series the liliaceae were placed in series coronariae while the amaryllideae were placed in series epigynae the liliaceae now consisted of twenty tribes including tulipeae scilleae and asparageae and the amaryllideae of five including agaveae and alstroemerieae an important addition to the treatment of the liliaceae was the recognition of the allieae as a distinct tribe that would eventually find its way to the asparagales as the subfamily allioideae of the amaryllidaceae postdarwinian the appearance of charles darwins origin of species in 1859 changed the way that taxonomists considered plant classification incorporating evolutionary information into their schemata the darwinian approach led to the concept of phylogeny treelike structure in assembling classification systems starting with eichler eichler having established a hierarchical system in which the flowering plants angiosperms were divided into monocotyledons and dicotyledons further divided into former into seven orders within the liliiflorae were seven families including liliaceae and amaryllidaceae liliaceae included allium and ornithogalum modern allioideae and asparagus engler in his system developed eichlers ideas into a much more elaborate scheme which he treated in a number of works including die natürlichen pflanzenfamilien engler and prantl 1888 and syllabus der pflanzenfamilien 18921924 in his treatment of liliiflorae the liliineae were a suborder which included both families liliaceae and amaryllidaceae the liliaceae had eight subfamilies and the amaryllidaceae four in this rearrangement of liliaceae with fewer subdivisions the core liliales were represented as subfamily lilioideae with tulipae and scilleae as tribes the asparagae were represented as asparagoideae and the allioideae was preserved representing the alliaceous genera allieae agapantheae and gilliesieae were the three tribes within this subfamily in the amaryllidaceae there was little change from the bentham  hooker a similar approach was adopted by wettstein twentieth century in the twentieth century the wettstein system 19011935 placed many of the taxa in an order called liliiflorae next johannes paulus lotsy 1911 proposed dividing the liliiflorae into a number of smaller families including asparagaceae then herbert huber 1969 1977 following lotsys example proposed that the liliiflorae be split into four groups including the asparagoid liliiflorae the widely used cronquist system 19681988 used the very broadly defined order liliales these various proposals to separate small groups of genera into more homogeneous families made little impact till that of dahlgren 1985 incorporating new information including synapomorphy dahlgren developed hubers ideas further and popularised them with a major deconstruction of existing families into smaller units they created a new order calling it asparagales this was one of five orders within the superorder liliiflorae where cronquist saw one family dahlgren saw forty distributed over three orders predominantly liliales and asparagales over the 1980s in the context of a more general review of the classification of angiosperms the liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny by the end of that decade the royal botanic gardens at kew the british museum of natural history and the edinburgh botanical gardens formed a committee to examine the possibility of separating the family at least for the organization of their herbaria that committee finally recommended that 24 new families be created in the place of the original broad liliaceae largely by elevating subfamilies to the rank of separate families phylogenetics the order asparagales as currently circumscribed has only recently been recognized in classification systems through the advent of phylogenetics the 1990s saw considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory enabling a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of the flowering plants the establishment of major new clades necessitated a departure from the older but widely used classifications such as cronquist and thorne based largely on morphology rather than genetic data this complicated the discussion about plant evolution and necessitated a major restructuring rbcl gene sequencing and cladistic analysis of monocots had redefined the liliales in 1995 from four morphological orders sensu dahlgren the largest clade representing the liliaceae all previously included in liliales but including both the calochortaceae and liliaceae sensu tamura this redefined family that became referred to as core liliales but corresponded to the emerging circumscription of the angiosperm phylogeny group 1998 phylogeny and apg system the 2009 revision of the angiosperm phylogeny group system apg iii places the order in the clade monocots from the dahlgren system of 1985 onwards studies based mainly on morphology had identified the asparagales as a distinct group but had also included groups now located in liliales pandanales and zingiberales research in the 21st century has supported the monophyly of asparagales based on morphology 18s rdna and other dna sequences although some phylogenetic reconstructions based on molecular data have suggested that asparagales may be paraphyletic with orchidaceae separated from the rest within the monocots asparagales is the sister group of the commelinid clade this cladogram shows the placement of asparagales within the orders of lilianae sensu chase  reveal monocots based on molecular phylogenetic evidence the lilioid monocot orders are bracketed namely petrosaviales dioscoreales pandanales liliales and asparagales these constitute a paraphyletic assemblage that is groups with a common ancestor that do not include all direct descendants in this case commelinids as the sister group to asparagales to form a clade all the groups joined by thick lines would need to be included while acorales and alismatales have been collectively referred to as alismatid monocots basal or early branching monocots the remaining clades lilioid and commelinid monocots have been referred to as the core monocots the relationship between the orders with the exception of the two sister orders is pectinate that is diverging in succession from the line that leads to the commelinids numbers indicate crown group most recent common ancestor of the sampled species of the clade of interest divergence times in mya million years ago subdivision a phylogenetic tree for the asparagales generally to family level but including groups which were recently and widely treated as families but which are now reduced to subfamily rank is shown below the tree shown above can be divided into a basal paraphyletic group the lower asparagales asparagoids from orchidaceae to asphodelaceae and a wellsupported monophyletic group of core asparagales higher asparagoids comprising the two largest families amaryllidaceae sensu lato and asparagaceae sensu lato two differences between these two groups although with exceptions are the mode of microsporogenesis and the position of the ovary the lower asparagales typically have simultaneous microsporogenesis ie cell walls develop only after both meiotic divisions which appears to be an apomorphy within the monocots whereas the core asparagales have reverted to successive microsporogenesis ie cell walls develop after each division the lower asparagales typically have an inferior ovary whereas the core asparagales have reverted to a superior ovary a 2002 morphological study by rudall treated possessing an inferior ovary as a synapomorphy of the asparagales stating that reversions to a superior ovary in the core asparagales could be associated with the presence of nectaries below the ovaries however stevens notes that superior ovaries are distributed among the lower asparagales in such a way that it is not clear where to place the evolution of different ovary morphologies the position of the ovary seems a much more flexible character here and in other angiosperms than previously thought changes to family structure in apg iii the apg iii system when it was published in 2009 greatly expanded the families xanthorrhoeaceae amaryllidaceae and asparagaceae thirteen of the families of the earlier apg ii system were thereby reduced to subfamilies within these three families the expanded xanthorrhoeaceae is now called asphodelaceaejuly 2018 the apg ii families left and their equivalent apg iii subfamilies right are as follows structure of asparagales orchid clade orchidaceae is possibly the largest family of all angiosperms only asteraceae might  or might not  be more speciose and hence by far the largest in the order the dahlgren system recognized three families of orchids but dna sequence analysis later showed that these families are polyphyletic and so should be combined several studies suggest with high bootstrap support that orchidaceae is the sister of the rest of the asparagales other studies have placed the orchids differently in the phylogenetic tree generally among the boryaceaehypoxidaceae clade the position of orchidaceae shown above seems the best current hypothesis but cannot be taken as confirmed orchids have simultaneous microsporogenesis and inferior ovaries two characters that are typical of the lower asparagales however their nectaries are rarely in the septa of the ovaries and most orchids have dustlike seeds atypical of the rest of the order some members of vanilloideae and cypripedioideae have crustose seeds probably associated with dispersal by birds and mammals that are attracted by fermenting fleshy fruit releasing fragrant compounds eg vanilla in terms of the number of species orchidaceae diversification is remarkable with recent estimations suggesting that despite the old origin of the family dating back to the late cretaceous modern orchid diversity originated mostly during the last 5 million years however although the other asparagales may be less rich in species they are more variable morphologically including treelike forms boryaceae to hypoxidaceae the four families excluding boryaceae form a wellsupported clade in studies based on dna sequence analysis all four contain relatively few species and it has been suggested that they be combined into one family under the name hypoxidaceae sensu lato the relationship between boryaceae which includes only two genera borya and alania and other asparagales has remained unclear for a long time the boryaceae are mycorrhizal but not in the same way as orchids morphological studies have suggested a close relationship between boryaceae and blandfordiaceae there is relatively low support for the position of boryaceae in the tree shown above ixioliriaceae to xeronemataceae the relationship shown between ixioliriaceae and tecophilaeaceae is still unclear some studies have supported a clade of these two families others have not the position of doryanthaceae has also varied with support for the position shown above but also support for other positions the clade from iridaceae upwards appears to have stronger support all have some genetic characteristics in common having lost arabidopsistype telomeres iridaceae is distinctive among the asparagales in the unique structure of the inflorescence a rhipidium the combination of an inferior ovary and three stamens and the common occurrence of unifacial leaves whereas bifacial leaves are the norm in other asparagales members of the clade from iridaceae upwards have infralocular septal nectaries which rudall interpreted as a driver towards secondarily superior ovaries asphodelaceae  core asparagales the next node in the tree xanthorrhoeaceae sensu lato  the core asparagales has strong support anomalous secondary thickening occurs among this clade eg in xanthorrhoea family asphodelaceae and dracaena family asparagaceae sensu lato with species reaching treelike proportions the core asparagales comprising amaryllidaceae sensu lato and asparagaceae sensu lato are a strongly supported clade as are clades for each of the families relationships within these broadly defined families appear less clear particularly within the asparagaceae sensu lato stevens notes that most of its subfamilies are difficult to recognize and that significantly different divisions have been used in the past so that the use of a broadly defined family to refer to the entire clade is justified thus the relationships among subfamilies shown above based on apweb 2010 is somewhat uncertain evolution several studies have attempted to date the evolution of the asparagales based on phylogenetic evidence earlier studies generally give younger dates than more recent studies which have been preferred in the table below a 2009 study suggests that the asparagales have the highest diversification rate in the monocots about the same as the order poales although in both orders the rate is little over half that of the eudicot order lamiales the clade with the highest rate comparison of family structures the taxonomic diversity of the monocotyledons is described in detail by kubitzki uptodate information on the asparagales can be found on the angiosperm phylogeny website the apg iii systems family circumscriptions are being used as the basis of the kewhosted world checklist of selected plant families with this circumscription the order consists of 14 families dahlgren had 31 with approximately 1120 genera and 26000 species order asparagales link the earlier 2003 version apg ii allowed bracketed families ie families which could either be segregated from more comprehensive families or could be included in them these are the families given under including in the list above apg iii does not allow bracketed families requiring the use of the more comprehensive family otherwise the circumscription of the asparagales is unchanged a separate paper accompanying the publication of the 2009 apg iii system provided subfamilies to accommodate the families which were discontinued the first apg system of 1998 contained some extra families included in square brackets in the list above two older systems which use the order asparagales are the dahlgren system and the kubitzki system the families included in the circumscriptions of the order in these two systems are shown in the first and second columns of the table below the equivalent family in the modern apg iii system see below is shown in the third column note that although these systems may use the same name for a family the genera which it includes may be different so the equivalence between systems is only approximate in some cases uses the asparagales include many important crop plants and ornamental plants crops include allium asparagus and vanilla while ornamentals include irises hyacinths and orchids see also notes references bibliography books chapters articles apg historical sources websites reference

mostly tropical or aquatic some grow in fresh water some in marine habitats perhaps the most important food crop in the order is the corm of the taro plant colocasia esculenta description the alismatales comprise herbaceous flowering plants of often aquatic and marshy habitats and the only monocots known to have green embryos other than the amaryllidaceae they also include the only marine angiosperms growing completely submerged the seagrasses the flowers are usually arranged in inflorescences and the mature seeds lack endosperm both marine and freshwater forms include those with staminate flowers that detach from the parent plant and float to the surface there they can pollinate carpellate flowers floating on the surface via long pedicels in others pollination occurs underwater where pollen may form elongated strands increasing chance of success most aquatic species have a totally submerged juvenile phase and flowers are either floating or emerge above the waters surface vegetation may be totally submersed have floating leaves or protrude from the water collectively they are commonly known as water plantain taxonomy the alismatales contain about 165 genera in 13 families with a cosmopolitan distribution phylogenetically they are basal monocots diverging early in evolution relative to the lilioid and commelinid monocot lineages together with the acorales the alismatales are referred to informally as the alismatid monocots early systems the cronquist system 1981 places the alismatales in subclass alismatidae class liliopsida monocotyledons and includes only three families as shown cronquists subclass alismatidae conformed fairly closely to the order alismatales as defined by apg minus the araceae the dahlgren system places the alismatales in the superorder alismatanae in the subclass liliidae monocotyledons in the class magnoliopsida angiosperms with the following families included in tahktajans classification 1997 the order alismatales contains only the alismataceae and limnocharitaceae making it equivalent to the alismataceae as revised in apgiii other families included in the alismatates as currently defined are here distributed among 10 additional orders all of which are assigned with the following exception to the subclass alismatidae araceae in tahktajan 1997 is assigned to the arales and placed in the subclass aridae tofieldiaceae to the melanthiales and placed in the liliidae angiosperm phylogeny group the angiosperm phylogeny group system apg of 1998 and apg ii 2003 assigned the alismatales to the monocots which may be thought of as an unranked clade containing the families listed below the biggest departure from earlier systems see below is the inclusion of family araceae by its inclusion the order has grown enormously in number of species the family araceae alone accounts for about a hundred genera totaling over two thousand species the rest of the families together contain only about five hundred species many of which are in very small families the apg iii system 2009 differs only in that the limnocharitaceae are combined with the alismataceae it was also suggested that the genus maundia of the juncaginaceae could be separated into a monogeneric family the maundiaceae but the authors noted that more study was necessary before the maundiaceae could be recognized in apg iv 2016 it was decided that evidence was sufficient to elevate maundia to family level as the monogeneric maundiaceae the authors considered including a number of the smaller orders within the juncaginaceae but an online survey of botanists and other users found little support for this lumping approach consequently the family structure for apg iv is phylogeny cladogram showing the orders of monocots lilianae sensu chase  reveal based on molecular phylogenetic evidence references further reading external links apiales categories apiales angiosperm orders taxa named by takenoshin nakai the apiales are an order of flowering plants the families are those recognized in the apg iii system this is typical of the newer classifications though there is some slight variation and in particular the torriceliaceae may also be divided under this definition wellknown members include carrots celery parsley and hedera helix english ivy the order apiales is placed within the asterid group of eudicots as circumscribed by the apg iii system within the asterids apiales belongs to an unranked group called the campanulids and within the campanulids it belongs to a clade known in phylogenetic nomenclature as apiidae in 2010 a subclade of apiidae named dipsapiidae was defined to consist of the three orders apiales paracryphiales and dipsacales taxonomy under the cronquist system only the apiaceae and araliaceae were included here and the restricted order was placed among the rosids rather than the asterids the pittosporaceae were placed within the rosales and many of the other forms within the family cornaceae pennantia was in the family icacinaceae in the classification system of dahlgren the families apiaceae and araliaceae were placed in the order ariales in the superorder araliiflorae also called aralianae the present understanding of the apiales is fairly recent and is based upon comparison of dna sequences by phylogenetic methods the circumscriptions of some of the families have changed in 2009 one of the subfamilies of araliaceae was shown to be polyphyletic gynoecia the largest and obviously closely related families of apiales are araliaceae myodocarpaceae and apiaceae which resemble each other in the structure of their gynoecia in this respect however the pittosporaceae is notably distinct from them typical syncarpous gynoecia exhibit four vertical zones determined by the extent of fusion of the carpels in most plants the synascidiate ie united bottleshaped and symplicate zones are fertile and bear the ovules each of the first three families possess mainly bi or multilocular ovaries in a gynoecium with a long synascidiate but very short symplicate zone where the ovules are inserted at their transition the socalled crosszone or querzone in gynoecia of the pittosporaceae the symplicate is much longer than the synascidiate zone and the ovules are arranged along the first members of the latter family consequently have unilocular ovaries with a single cavity between adjacent carpels references asterales categories asterales angiosperm orders asterales ˌ is an order of dicotyledonous flowering plants that includes the large family asteraceae or compositae known for composite flowers made of florets and ten families related to the asteraceae while asterids in general are characterized by fused petals composite flowers consisting of many florets create the false appearance of separate petals as found in the rosids the order is cosmopolitan plants found throughout most of the world including desert and frigid zones and includes mostly herbaceous species although a small number of trees such as the lobelia deckenii the giant lobelia and dendrosenecio giant groundsels and shrubs are also present asterales are organisms that seem to have evolved from one common ancestor asterales share characteristics on morphological and biochemical levels synapomorphies a character that is shared by two or more groups through evolutionary development include the presence in the plants of oligosaccharide inulin a nutrient storage molecule used instead of starch and unique stamen morphology the stamens are usually found around the style either aggregated densely or fused into a tube probably an adaptation in association with the plunger brush or secondary pollination that is common among the families of the order wherein pollen is collected and stored on the length of the pistil taxonomy the name and order asterales is botanically venerable dating back to at least 1926 in the hutchinson system of plant taxonomy when it contained only five families of which only two are retained in the apg iii classification under the cronquist system of taxonomic classification of flowering plants asteraceae was the only family in the group but newer systems such as apg ii and apg iii have expanded it to 11 in the classification system of rolf dahlgren the asterales were in the superorder asteriflorae also called asteranae the order asterales currently includes 11 families the largest of which are the asteraceae with about 25000 species and the campanulaceae bellflowers with about 2000 species the remaining families count together for less than 1500 species the two large families are cosmopolitan with many of their species found in the northern hemisphere and the smaller families are usually confined to australia and the adjacent areas or sometimes south america only the asteraceae have composite flower heads the other families do not but share other characteristics such as storage of inulin that define the 11 families as more closely related to each other than to other plant families or orders such as the rosids the phylogenetic tree according to apg iii for the campanulid clade is as below phylogeny although most extant species of asteraceae are herbaceous the examination of the basal members in the family suggests that the common ancestor of the family was an arborescent plant a tree or shrub perhaps adapted to dry conditions radiating from south america less can be said about the asterales themselves with certainty although since several families in asterales contain trees the ancestral member is most likely to have been a tree or shrub because all clades are represented in the southern hemisphere but many not in the northern hemisphere it is natural to conjecture that there is a common southern origin to them asterales are angiosperms flowering plants that appeared about 140 million years ago the asterales order probably originated in the cretaceous 145  66 mya on the supercontinent gondwana which broke up from 184  80 mya forming the area that is now australia south america africa india and antarctica asterales contain about 14 of eudicot diversity from an analysis of relationships and diversities within the asterales and with their superorders estimates of the age of the beginning of the asterales have been made which range from 116 mya to 82mya however few fossils have been found of the menyanthaceaeasteraceae clade in the oligocene about 29 mya fossil evidence of the asterales is rare and belongs to rather recent epochs so the precise estimation of the orders age is quite difficult an oligocene 34  23 mya pollen is known for asteraceae and goodeniaceae and seeds from oligocene and miocene 23  53 mya are known for menyanthaceae and campanulaceae respectively biogeography the core asterales are stylidiaceae six genera apa clade alseuosmiaceae phellinaceae and argophyllaceae together seven genera mgca clade menyanthaceae goodeniaceae calyceraceae in total twenty genera and asteraceae about sixteen hundred genera other asterales are rousseaceae four genera campanulaceae eightyfour genera and pentaphragmataceae one genus all asterales families are represented in the southern hemisphere however asteraceae and campanulaceae are cosmopolitan and menyanthaceae nearly so uses the asterales by dint of being a superset of the family asteraceae include some species grown for food including the sunflower helianthus annuus lettuce lactuca sativa and chicory cichorium many are also used as spices and traditional medicines asterales are common plants and have many known uses for example pyrethrum derived from old world members of the genus chrysanthemum is a natural insecticide with minimal environmental impact wormwood derived from a genus that includes the sagebrush is used as a source of flavoring for absinthe a bitter classical liquor of european origin references further reading external links asteroid categories asteroids minor planets an asteroid is a minor planetan object that is neither a true planet nor a cometthat orbits within the inner solar system they are rocky metallic or icy bodies with no atmosphere the size and shape of asteroids vary significantly ranging from small rubble piles under a kilometer across to ceres a dwarf planet almost 1000 km in diameter of the roughly one million known asteroids the greatest number are located between the orbits of mars and jupiter approximately 2 to 4 au from the sun in a region known as the main asteroid belt asteroids are generally classified to be of three types ctype mtype and stype these describe asteroids with carbonaceous metallic and silicaceous compositions respectively the size of asteroids varies greatly the largest ceres is almost 1000 across and qualifies as a dwarf planet the total mass of all the asteroids combined is only 3 that of earths moon the majority of main belt asteroids follow slightly elliptical stable orbits revolving in the same direction as the earth and taking from three to six years to complete a full circuit of the sun asteroids have historically been observed from earth the galileo spacecraft made the first closeup observation of an asteroidseveral dedicated missions to asteroids were subsequently launched by nasa and jaxa with plans for other missions in progress nasas near shoemaker studied eros and dawn observed vesta and ceres jaxas missions hayabusa and hayabusa2 studied and returned samples of itokawa and ryugu respectively osirisrex studied bennu collecting a sample in 2020 which was delivered back to earth in 2023 nasas lucy launched in 2021 is tasked with studying ten different asteroids two from the main belt and eight jupiter trojans psyche launched in october 2023 aims to study a metallic asteroid of the same name nearearth asteroids can threaten all life on the planet an asteroid impact event may have resulted in the cretaceouspaleogene extinction different asteroid deflection strategies have been proposed the double asteroid redirection test spacecraft or dart was launched in 2021 and intentionally impacted dimorphos in september 2022 successfully altering its orbit by crashing into it history of observations despite their large numbers asteroids are a relatively recent discovery with the first known asteroidceresonly being identified in 1801 only one asteroid 4 vesta which has a relatively reflective surface is normally visible to the naked eye when favorably positioned 4 vesta can be seen in dark skies rarely small asteroids passing close to earth may be visible to the naked eye for a short amount of time 2022 the minor planet center had data on 1199224 minor planets in the inner and outer solar system of which about 614690 had enough information to be given numbered designations discovery of ceres in 1772 german astronomer johann elert bode citing johann daniel titius published a numerical procession known as the titiusbode law now discredited except for an unexplained gap between mars and jupiter bodes formula seemed to predict the orbits of the known planets he wrote the following explanation for the existence of a missing planet bodes formula predicted another planet would be found with an orbital radius near 28 astronomical units au or 420 million km from the sun the titiusbode law got a boost with william herschels discovery of uranus near the predicted distance for a planet beyond saturn in 1800 a group headed by franz xaver von zach editor of the german astronomical journal monatliche correspondenz monthly correspondence sent requests to 24 experienced astronomers whom he dubbed the celestial police asking that they combine their efforts and begin a methodical search for the expected planet although they did not discover ceres they later found the asteroids 2 pallas 3 juno and 4 vesta one of the astronomers selected for the search was giuseppe piazzi a catholic priest at the academy of palermo sicily before receiving his invitation to join the group piazzi discovered ceres on 1 january 1801 he was searching for the 87th star of the catalogue of the zodiacal stars of mr la caille but found that it was preceded by another instead of a star piazzi had found a moving starlike object which he first thought was a comet piazzi observed ceres a total of 24 times the final time on 11 february 1801 when illness interrupted his work he announced his discovery on 24 january 1801 in letters to only two fellow astronomers his compatriot barnaba oriani of milan and bode in berlin he reported it as a comet but since its movement is so slow and rather uniform it has occurred to me several times that it might be something better than a comet in april piazzi sent his complete observations to oriani bode and french astronomer jérôme lalande the information was published in the september 1801 issue of the monatliche correspondenz by this time the apparent position of ceres had changed mostly due to earths motion around the sun and was too close to the suns glare for other astronomers to confirm piazzis observations toward the end of the year ceres should have been visible again but after such a long time it was difficult to predict its exact position to recover ceres mathematician carl friedrich gauss then 24 years old developed an efficient method of orbit determination in a few weeks he predicted the path of ceres and sent his results to von zach on 31 december 1801 von zach and fellow celestial policeman heinrich w m olbers found ceres near the predicted position and thus recovered it at 28 au from the sun ceres appeared to fit the titiusbode law almost perfectly however neptune once discovered in 1846 was 8 au closer than predicted leading most astronomers to conclude that the law was a coincidence piazzi named the newly discovered object ceres ferdinandea in honor of the patron goddess of sicily and of king ferdinand of bourbon further search three other asteroids 2 pallas 3 juno and 4 vesta were discovered by von zachs group over the next few years with vesta found in 1807 no new asteroids were discovered until 1845 amateur astronomer karl ludwig hencke started his searches of new asteroids in 1830 and fifteen years later while looking for vesta he found the asteroid later named 5 astraea it was the first new asteroid discovery in 38 years carl friedrich gauss was given the honor of naming the asteroid after this other astronomers joined 15 asteroids were found by the end of 1851 in 1868 when james craig watson discovered the 100th asteroid the french academy of sciences engraved the faces of karl theodor robert luther john russell hind and hermann goldschmidt the three most successful asteroidhunters at that time on a commemorative medallion marking the event in 1891 max wolf pioneered the use of astrophotography to detect asteroids which appeared as short streaks on longexposure photographic plates this dramatically increased the rate of detection compared with earlier visual methods wolf alone discovered 248 asteroids beginning with 323 brucia whereas only slightly more than 300 had been discovered up to that point it was known that there were many more but most astronomers did not bother with them some calling them vermin of the skies a phrase variously attributed to eduard suess and edmund weiss even a century later only a few thousand asteroids were identified numbered and named 19th and 20th centuries in the past asteroids were discovered by a fourstep process first a region of the sky was photographed by a widefield telescope or astrograph pairs of photographs were taken typically one hour apart multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days second the two films or plates of the same region were viewed under a stereoscope a body in orbit around the sun would move slightly between the pair of films under the stereoscope the image of the body would seem to float slightly above the background of stars third once a moving body was identified its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope the location would be measured relative to known star locations these first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery the observer has only found an apparition which gets a provisional designation made up of the year of discovery a letter representing the halfmonth of discovery and finally a letter and a number indicating the discoverys sequential number example 1998 fj the last step is sending the locations and time of observations to the minor planet center where computer programs determine whether an apparition ties together earlier apparitions into a single orbit if so the object receives a catalogue number and the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer and granted the honor of naming the object subject to the approval of the international astronomical union naming by 1851 the royal astronomical society decided that asteroids were being discovered at such a rapid rate that a different system was needed to categorize or name asteroids in 1852 when de gasparis discovered the twentieth asteroid benjamin valz gave it a name and a number designating its rank among asteroid discoveries 20 massalia sometimes asteroids were discovered and not seen again so starting in 1892 new asteroids were listed by the year and a capital letter indicating the order in which the asteroids orbit was calculated and registered within that specific year for example the first two asteroids discovered in 1892 were labeled 1892a and 1892b however there were not enough letters in the alphabet for all of the asteroids discovered in 1893 so 1893z was followed by 1893aa a number of variations of these methods were tried including designations that included year plus a greek letter in 1914 a simple chronological numbering system was established in 1925 currently all newly discovered asteroids receive a provisional designation such as 2002 at consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code indicating the halfmonth of discovery and the sequence within that halfmonth once an asteroids orbit has been confirmed it is given a number and later may also be given a name eg 433 eros the formal naming convention uses parentheses around the numbereg 433 erosbut dropping the parentheses is quite common informally it is also common to drop the number altogether or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text in addition names can be proposed by the asteroids discoverer within guidelines established by the international astronomical union symbols the first asteroids to be discovered were assigned iconic symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate the planets by 1855 there were two dozen asteroid symbols which often occurred in multiple variants in 1851 after the fifteenth asteroid eunomia had been discovered johann franz encke made a major change in the upcoming 1854 edition of the berliner astronomisches jahrbuch baj berlin astronomical yearbook he introduced a disk circle a traditional symbol for a star as the generic symbol for an asteroid the circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid the numberedcircle convention was quickly adopted by astronomers and the next asteroid to be discovered 16 psyche in 1852 was the first to be designated in that way at the time of its discovery however psyche was given an iconic symbol as well as were a few other asteroids discovered over the next few years 20 massalia was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol and no iconic symbols were created after the 1855 discovery of 37 fides terminologyterminology the first discovered asteroid ceres was originally considered a new planet it was followed by the discovery of other similar bodies which with the equipment of the time appeared to be points of light like stars showing little or no planetary disc though readily distinguishable from stars due to their apparent motions this prompted the astronomer sir william herschel to propose the term asteroid coined in greek as ἀστεροειδής or asteroeidēs meaning starlike starshaped and derived from the ancient greek ἀστήρ astēr star planet in the early second half of the 19th century the terms asteroid and planet not always qualified as minor were still used interchangeably traditionally small bodies orbiting the sun were classified as comets asteroids or meteoroids with anything smaller than one meter across being called a meteoroid the term asteroid never had a formal definition with the broader term small solar system bodies being preferred by the international astronomical union iau as no iau definition exists asteroid can be defined as an irregularly shaped rocky body orbiting the sun that does not qualify as a planet or a dwarf planet under the iau definitions of those terms when found asteroids were seen as a class of objects distinct from comets and there was no unified term for the two until small solar system body was coined in 2006 the main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to sublimation of nearsurface ices by solar radiation a few objects have ended up being duallisted because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity conversely some perhaps all comets are eventually depleted of their surface volatile ices and become asteroidlike a further distinction is that comets typically have more eccentric orbits than most asteroids asteroids with notably eccentric orbits are probably dormant or extinct comets for almost two centuries from the discovery of ceres in 1801 until the discovery of the first centaur 2060 chiron in 1977 all known asteroids spent most of their time at or within the orbit of jupiter though a few such as 944 hidalgo ventured far beyond jupiter for part of their orbit when astronomers started finding more small bodies that permanently resided further out than jupiter now called centaurs they numbered them among the traditional asteroids there was debate over whether these objects should be considered asteroids or given a new classification then when the first transneptunian object other than pluto 15760 albion was discovered in 1992 and especially when large numbers of similar objects started turning up new terms were invented to sidestep the issue kuiperbelt object transneptunian object scattereddisc object and so on they inhabit the cold outer reaches of the solar system where ices remain solid and cometlike bodies are not expected to exhibit much cometary activity if centaurs or transneptunian objects were to venture close to the sun their volatile ices would sublimate and traditional approaches would classify them as comets and not asteroids the innermost of these are the kuiperbelt objects called objects partly to avoid the need to classify them as asteroids or comets they are thought to be predominantly cometlike in composition though some may be more akin to asteroids furthermore most do not have the highly eccentric orbits associated with comets and the ones so far discovered are larger than traditional comet nuclei the much more distant oort cloud is hypothesized to be the main reservoir of dormant comets other recent observations such as the analysis of the cometary dust collected by the stardust probe are increasingly blurring the distinction between comets and asteroids suggesting a continuum between asteroids and comets rather than a sharp dividing line the minor planets beyond jupiters orbit are sometimes also called asteroids especially in popular presentations however it is becoming increasingly common for the term asteroid to be restricted to minor planets of the inner solar system therefore this article will restrict itself for the most part to the classical asteroids objects of the asteroid belt jupiter trojans and nearearth objects when the iau introduced the class small solar system bodies in 2006 to include most objects previously classified as minor planets and comets they created the class of dwarf planets for the largest minor planetsthose that have enough mass to have become ellipsoidal under their own gravity according to the iau the term minor planet may still be used but generally the term small solar system body will be preferred currently only the largest object in the asteroid belt ceres at about 975 across has been placed in the dwarf planet category formation many asteroids are the shattered remnants of planetesimals bodies within the young suns solar nebula that never grew large enough to become planets it is thought that planetesimals in the asteroid belt evolved much like the rest of objects in the solar nebula until jupiter neared its current mass at which point excitation from orbital resonances with jupiter ejected over 99 of planetesimals in the belt simulations and a discontinuity in spin rate and spectral properties suggest that asteroids larger than approximately 120 in diameter accreted during that early era whereas smaller bodies are fragments from collisions between asteroids during or after the jovian disruption ceres and vesta grew large enough to melt and differentiate with heavy metallic elements sinking to the core leaving rocky minerals in the crust in the nice model many kuiperbelt objects are captured in the outer asteroid belt at distances greater than 26 au most were later ejected by jupiter but those that remained may be the dtype asteroids and possibly include ceres distribution within the solar system various dynamical groups of asteroids have been discovered orbiting in the inner solar system their orbits are perturbed by the gravity of other bodies in the solar system and by the yarkovsky effect significant populations include asteroid belt the majority of known asteroids orbit within the asteroid belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter generally in relatively loweccentricity ie not very elongated orbits this belt is estimated to contain between 11 and 19 million asteroids larger than 1 in diameter and millions of smaller ones these asteroids may be remnants of the protoplanetary disk and in this region the accretion of planetesimals into planets during the formative period of the solar system was prevented by large gravitational perturbations by jupiter contrary to popular imagery the asteroid belt is mostly empty the asteroids are spread over such a large volume that reaching an asteroid without aiming carefully would be improbable nonetheless hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known and the total number ranges in the millions or more depending on the lower size cutoff over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100 km and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that the asteroid belt has between 700000 and 17 million asteroids with a diameter of 1 km or more the absolute magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are between 11 and 19 with the median at about 16 the total mass of the asteroid belt is estimated to be 239e21 kg which is just 3 of the mass of the moon the mass of the kuiper belt and scattered disk is over 100 times as large the four largest objects ceres vesta pallas and hygiea account for maybe 62 of the belts total mass with 39 accounted for by ceres alone trojans trojans are populations that share an orbit with a larger planet or moon but do not collide with it because they orbit in one of the two lagrangian points of stability yes and yes which lie 60 ahead of and behind the larger body in the solar system most known trojans share the orbit of jupiter they are divided into the greek camp at yes ahead of jupiter and the trojan camp at yes trailing jupiter more than a million jupiter trojans larger than one kilometer are thought to exist of which more than 7000 are currently catalogued in other planetary orbits only nine mars trojans 28 neptune trojans two uranus trojans and two earth trojans have been found to date a temporary venus trojan is also known numerical orbital dynamics stability simulations indicate that saturn and uranus probably do not have any primordial trojans nearearth asteroids nearearth asteroids or neas are asteroids that have orbits that pass close to that of earth asteroids that actually cross earths orbital path are known as earthcrossers 2022 a total of 28772 nearearth asteroids were known 878 have a diameter of one kilometer or larger a small number of neas are extinct comets that have lost their volatile surface materials although having a faint or intermittent cometlike tail does not necessarily result in a classification as a nearearth comet making the boundaries somewhat fuzzy the rest of the nearearth asteroids are driven out of the asteroid belt by gravitational interactions with jupiter many asteroids have natural satellites minorplanet moons 2021 there were 85 neas known to have at least one moon including three known to have two moons the asteroid 3122 florence one of the largest potentially hazardous asteroids with a diameter of 45 has two moons measuring 100300 across which were discovered by radar imaging during the asteroids 2017 approach to earth nearearth asteroids are divided into groups based on their semimajor axis a perihelion distance q and aphelion distance q martian moons it is unclear whether martian moons phobos and deimos are captured asteroids or were formed due to impact event on mars phobos and deimos both have much in common with carbonaceous ctype asteroids with spectra albedo and density very similar to those of c or dtype asteroids based on their similarity one hypothesis is that both moons may be captured mainbelt asteroids both moons have very circular orbits which lie almost exactly in marss equatorial plane and hence a capture origin requires a mechanism for circularizing the initially highly eccentric orbit and adjusting its inclination into the equatorial plane most probably by a combination of atmospheric drag and tidal forces although it is not clear whether sufficient time was available for this to occur for deimos capture also requires dissipation of energy the current martian atmosphere is too thin to capture a phobossized object by atmospheric braking geoffrey a landis has pointed out that the capture could have occurred if the original body was a binary asteroid that separated under tidal forces phobos could be a secondgeneration solar system object that coalesced in orbit after mars formed rather than forming concurrently out of the same birth cloud as mars another hypothesis is that mars was once surrounded by many phobos and deimossized bodies perhaps ejected into orbit around it by a collision with a large planetesimal the high porosity of the interior of phobos based on the density of 188 gcm3 voids are estimated to comprise 25 to 35 percent of phoboss volume is inconsistent with an asteroidal origin observations of phobos in the thermal infrared suggest a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates which are well known from the surface of mars the spectra are distinct from those of all classes of chondrite meteorites again pointing away from an asteroidal origin both sets of findings support an origin of phobos from material ejected by an impact on mars that reaccreted in martian orbit similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of earths moon characteristics size distribution asteroids vary greatly in size from almost 1000 for the largest down to rocks just 1 meter across below which an object is classified as a meteoroid the three largest are very much like miniature planets they are roughly spherical have at least partly differentiated interiors and are thought to be surviving protoplanets the vast majority however are much smaller and are irregularly shaped they are thought to be either battered planetesimals or fragments of larger bodies the dwarf planet ceres is by far the largest asteroid with a diameter of 940 the next largest are 4 vesta and 2 pallas both with diameters of just over 500 vesta is the brightest of the four mainbelt asteroids that can on occasion be visible to the naked eye on some rare occasions a nearearth asteroid may briefly become visible without technical aid see 99942 apophis the mass of all the objects of the asteroid belt lying between the orbits of mars and jupiter is estimated to be 2394  325 of the mass of the moon of this ceres comprises 938 about 40 of the total adding in the next three most massive objects vesta 11 pallas 85 and hygiea 34 brings this figure up to a bit over 60 whereas the next seven mostmassive asteroids bring the total up to 70 the number of asteroids increases rapidly as their individual masses decrease the number of asteroids decreases markedly with increasing size although the size distribution generally follows a power law there are bumps at about 5 and 100 where more asteroids than expected from such a curve are found most asteroids larger than approximately 120 km in diameter are primordial surviving from the accretion epoch whereas most smaller asteroids are products of fragmentation of primordial asteroids the primordial population of the main belt was probably 200 times what it is today largest asteroids three largest objects in the asteroid belt ceres vesta and pallas are intact protoplanets that share many characteristics common to planets and are atypical compared to the majority of irregularly shaped asteroids the fourthlargest asteroid hygiea appears nearly spherical although it may have an undifferentiated interior like the majority of asteroids the four largest asteroids constitute half the mass of the asteroid belt ceres is the only asteroid that appears to have a plastic shape under its own gravity and hence the only one that is a dwarf planet it has a much higher absolute magnitude than the other asteroids of around 332 and may possess a surface layer of ice like the planets ceres is differentiated it has a crust a mantle and a core no meteorites from ceres have been found on earth vesta too has a differentiated interior though it formed inside the solar systems frost line and so is devoid of water its composition is mainly of basaltic rock with minerals such as olivine aside from the large crater at its southern pole rheasilvia vesta also has an ellipsoidal shape vesta is the parent body of the vestian family and other vtype asteroids and is the source of the hed meteorites which constitute 5 of all meteorites on earth pallas is unusual in that like uranus it rotates on its side with its axis of rotation tilted at high angles to its orbital plane its composition is similar to that of ceres high in carbon and silicon and perhaps partially differentiated pallas is the parent body of the palladian family of asteroids hygiea is the largest carbonaceous asteroid and unlike the other largest asteroids lies relatively close to the plane of the ecliptic it is the largest member and presumed parent body of the hygiean family of asteroids because there is no sufficiently large crater on the surface to be the source of that family as there is on vesta it is thought that hygiea may have been completely disrupted in the collision that formed the hygiean family and recoalesced after losing a bit less than 2 of its mass observations taken with the very large telescopes sphere imager in 2017 and 2018 revealed that hygiea has a nearly spherical shape which is consistent both with it being in hydrostatic equilibrium or formerly being in hydrostatic equilibrium or with being disrupted and recoalescing internal differentiation of large asteroids is possibly related to their lack of natural satellites as satellites of main belt asteroids are mostly believed to form from collisional disruption creating a rubble pile structure rotation measurements of the rotation rates of large asteroids in the asteroid belt show that there is an upper limit very few asteroids with a diameter larger than 100 meters have a rotation period less than 22 hours for asteroids rotating faster than approximately this rate the inertial force at the surface is greater than the gravitational force so any loose surface material would be flung out however a solid object should be able to rotate much more rapidly this suggests that most asteroids with a diameter over 100 meters are rubble piles formed through the accumulation of debris after collisions between asteroids color asteroids become darker and redder with age due to space weathering however evidence suggests most of the color change occurs rapidly in the first hundred thousand years limiting the usefulness of spectral measurement for determining the age of asteroids surface features except for the big four ceres pallas vesta and hygiea asteroids are likely to be broadly similar in appearance if irregular in shape 50 253 mathilde is a rubble pile saturated with craters with diameters the size of the asteroids radius earthbased observations of 300 511 davida one of the largest asteroids after the big four reveal a similarly angular profile suggesting it is also saturated with radiussize craters mediumsized asteroids such as mathilde and 243 ida that have been observed up close also reveal a deep regolith covering the surface of the big four pallas and hygiea are practically unknown vesta has compression fractures encircling a radiussize crater at its south pole but is otherwise a spheroid dawn spacecraft revealed that ceres has a heavily cratered surface but with fewer large craters than expected models based on the formation of the current asteroid belt had suggested ceres should possess 10 to 15 craters larger than 400 in diameter the largest confirmed crater on ceres kerwan basin is 284 across the most likely reason for this is viscous relaxation of the crust slowly flattening out larger impacts composition asteroids are classified by their characteristic emission spectra with the majority falling into three main groups ctype mtype and stype these describe carbonaceous carbonrich metallic and silicaceous stony compositions respectively the physical composition of asteroids is varied and in most cases poorly understood ceres appears to be composed of a rocky core covered by an icy mantle where vesta is thought to have a nickeliron core olivine mantle and basaltic crust thought to be the largest undifferentiated asteroid 10 hygiea seems to have a uniformly primitive composition of carbonaceous chondrite but it may actually be a differentiated asteroid that was globally disrupted by an impact and then reassembled other asteroids appear to be the remnant cores or mantles of protoplanets high in rock and metal most small asteroids are believed to be piles of rubble held together loosely by gravity although the largest are probably solid some asteroids have moons or are coorbiting binaries rubble piles moons binaries and scattered asteroid families are thought to be the results of collisions that disrupted a parent asteroid or possibly a planet in the main asteroid belt there appear to be two primary populations of asteroid a dark volatilerich population consisting of the ctype and ptype asteroids with albedos less than 010 and densities under 22 and a dense volatilepoor population consisting of the stype and mtype asteroids with albedos over 015 and densities greater than 27 within these populations larger asteroids are denser presumably due to compression there appears to be minimal macroporosity interstitial vacuum in the score of asteroids with masses greater than 10 composition is calculated from three primary sources albedo surface spectrum and density the last can only be determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have so far every asteroid with moons has turned out to be a rubble pile a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume the investigated asteroids are as large as 280 km in diameter and include 121 hermione 268186183 km and 87 sylvia 384262232 km few asteroids are larger than 87 sylvia none of them have moons the fact that such large asteroids as sylvia may be rubble piles presumably due to disruptive impacts has important consequences for the formation of the solar system computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge this means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly water scientists hypothesize that some of the first water brought to earth was delivered by asteroid impacts after the collision that produced the moon in 2009 the presence of water ice was confirmed on the surface of 24 themis using nasas infrared telescope facility the surface of the asteroid appears completely covered in ice as this ice layer is sublimating it may be getting replenished by a reservoir of ice under the surface organic compounds were also detected on the surface the presence of ice on 24 themis makes the initial theory plausible in october 2013 water was detected on an extrasolar body for the first time on an asteroid orbiting the white dwarf gd 61 on 22 january 2014 european space agency esa scientists reported the detection for the first definitive time of water vapor on ceres the largest object in the asteroid belt the detection was made by using the farinfrared abilities of the herschel space observatory the finding is unexpected because comets not asteroids are typically considered to sprout jets and plumes according to one of the scientists the lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids findings have shown that solar winds can react with the oxygen in the upper layer of the asteroids and create water it has been estimated that every cubic metre of irradiated rock could contain up to 20 litres study was conducted using an atom probe tomography numbers are given for the itokawa stype asteroid acfer 049 a meteorite discovered in algeria in 1990 was shown in 2019 to have an ultraporous lithology upl porous texture that could be formed by removal of ice that filled these pores this suggests that upl represent fossils of primordial ice organic compounds asteroids contain traces of amino acids and other organic compounds and some speculate that asteroid impacts may have seeded the early earth with the chemicals necessary to initiate life or may have even brought life itself to earth an event called panspermia in august 2011 a report based on nasa studies with meteorites found on earth was published suggesting dna and rna components adenine guanine and related organic molecules may have been formed on asteroids and comets in outer space in november 2019 scientists reported detecting for the first time sugar molecules including ribose in meteorites suggesting that chemical processes on asteroids can produce some fundamentally essential bioingredients important to life and supporting the notion of an rna world prior to a dnabased origin of life on earth and possibly as well the notion of panspermia classification asteroids are commonly categorized according to two criteria the characteristics of their orbits and features of their reflectance spectrum orbital classification many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics apart from the broadest divisions it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered groups are relatively loose dynamical associations whereas families are tighter and result from the catastrophic breakup of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past families are more common and easier to identify within the main asteroid belt but several small families have been reported among the jupiter trojans main belt families were first recognized by kiyotsugu hirayama in 1918 and are often called hirayama families in his honor about 3035 of the bodies in the asteroid belt belong to dynamical families each thought to have a common origin in a past collision between asteroids a family has also been associated with the plutoid dwarf planet haumea some asteroids have unusual horseshoe orbits that are coorbital with earth or another planet examples are 3753 cruithne and 2002 aa the first instance of this type of orbital arrangement was discovered between saturns moons epimetheus and janus sometimes these horseshoe objects temporarily become quasisatellites for a few decades or a few hundred years before returning to their earlier status both earth and venus are known to have quasisatellites such objects if associated with earth or venus or even hypothetically mercury are a special class of aten asteroids however such objects could be associated with the outer planets as well spectral classification in 1975 an asteroid taxonomic system based on color albedo and spectral shape was developed by chapman morrison and zellner these properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroids surface material the original classification system had three categories ctypes for dark carbonaceous objects 75 of known asteroids stypes for stony silicaceous objects 17 of known asteroids and u for those that did not fit into either c or s this classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types the number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied the two most widely used taxonomies now used are the tholen classification and smass classification the former was proposed in 1984 by david j tholen and was based on data collected from an eightcolor asteroid survey performed in the 1980s this resulted in 14 asteroid categories in 2002 the small mainbelt asteroid spectroscopic survey resulted in a modified version of the tholen taxonomy with 24 different types both systems have three broad categories of c s and x asteroids where x consists of mostly metallic asteroids such as the mtype there are also several smaller classes the proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type some types are easier to detect than others biasing the totals problems originally spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroids composition however the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good and a variety of classifications are in use this has led to significant confusion although asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of the same or similar materials active asteroids active asteroid active asteroids are objects that have asteroidlike orbits but show cometlike visual characteristics that is they show comae tails or other visual evidence of massloss like a comet but their orbit remains within jupiters orbit like an asteroid these bodies were originally designated mainbelt comets mbcs in 2006 by astronomers david jewitt and henry hsieh but this name implies they are necessarily icy in composition like a comet and that they only exist within the mainbelt whereas the growing population of active asteroids shows that this is not always the case the first active asteroid discovered is 7968 elstpizarro it was discovered as an asteroid in 1979 but then was found to have a tail by eric elst and guido pizarro in 1996 and given the cometary designation 133pelstpizarro another notable object is 311ppanstarrs observations made by the hubble space telescope revealed that it had six cometlike tails the tails are suspected to be streams of material ejected by the asteroid as a result of a rubble pile asteroid spinning fast enough to remove material from it by smashing into the asteroid dimorphos nasas double asteroid redirection test spacecraft made it an active asteroid scientists had proposed that some active asteroids are the result of impact events but no one had ever observed the activation of an asteroid the dart mission activated dimorphos under precisely known and carefully observed impact conditions enabling the detailed study of the formation of an active asteroid for the first time observations show that dimorphos lost approximately 1 million kilograms after the collision impact produced a dust plume that temporarily brightened the didymos system and developed a 10000long dust tail that persisted for several months observation and exploration until the age of space travel objects in the asteroid belt could only be observed with large telescopes their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery the best modern groundbased telescopes and the earthorbiting hubble space telescope can only resolve a small amount of detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their light curves variation in brightness during rotation and their spectral properties sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occultations when an asteroid passes directly in front of a star radar imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters especially for nearearth asteroids spacecraft flybys can provide much more data than any ground or spacebased observations samplereturn missions gives insights about regolith composition groundbased observations as asteroids are rather small and faint objects the data that can be obtained from groundbased observations gbo are limited by means of groundbased optical telescopes the visual magnitude can be obtained when converted into the absolute magnitude it gives a rough estimate of the asteroids size lightcurve measurements can also be made by gbo when collected over a long period of time it allows an estimate of the rotational period the pole orientation sometimes and a rough estimate of the asteroids shape spectral data both visiblelight and nearinfrared spectroscopy gives information about the objects composition used to classify the observed asteroids such observations are limited as they provide information about only the thin layer on the surface up to several micrometers as planetologist patrick michel writes nearearth asteroids that come into close vicinity of the planet can be studied in more details with radar it provides information about the surface of the asteroid for example can show the presence of craters and boulders such observations were conducted by the arecibo observatory in puerto rico 305 meter dish and goldstone observatory in california 70 meter dish radar observations can also be used for accurate determination of the orbital and rotational dynamics of observed objects spacebased observations both space and groundbased observatories conducted asteroid search programs the spacebased searches are expected to detect more objects because there is no atmosphere to interfere and because they can observe larger portions of the sky neowise observed more than 100000 asteroids of the main belt spitzer space telescope observed more than 700 nearearth asteroids these observations determined rough sizes of the majority of observed objects but provided limited detail about surface properties such as regolith depth and composition angle of repose cohesion and porosity asteroids were also studied by the hubble space telescope such as tracking the colliding asteroids in the main belt breakup of an asteroid observing an active asteroid with six cometlike tails and observing asteroids that were chosen as targets of dedicated missions space probe missions according to patrick michel dedicated missions the first asteroid to be photographed in closeup was 951 gaspra in 1991 followed in 1993 by 243 ida and its moon dactyl all of which were imaged by the galileo probe en route to jupiter other asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft en route to other destinations include 9969 braille by deep space 1 in 1999 5535 annefrank by stardust in 2002 2867 šteins and 21 lutetia by the rosetta probe in 2008 and 4179 toutatis chinas lunar orbiter change 2 which flew within 2 in 2012 the first dedicated asteroid probe was nasas near shoemaker which photographed 253 mathilde in 1997 before entering into orbit around 433 eros finally landing on its surface in 2001 it was the first spacecraft to successfully orbit and land on an asteroid from september to november 2005 the japanese hayabusa probe studied 25143 itokawa in detail and returned samples of its surface to earth on 13 june 2010 the first asteroid samplereturn mission in 2007 nasa launched the dawn spacecraft which orbited 4 vesta for a year and observed the dwarf planet ceres for three years hayabusa2 a probe launched by jaxa 2014 orbited its target asteroid 162173 ryugu for more than a year and took samples that were delivered to earth in 2020 the spacecraft is now on an extended mission and expected to arrive at a new target in 2031 nasa launched the osirisrex in 2016 a sample return mission to asteroid 101955 bennu in 2021 the probe departed the asteroid with a sample from its surface sample was delivered to earth in september 2023 the spacecraft continues its extended mission designated osirisapex to explore nearearth asteroid apophis in 2029 in 2021 nasa launched double asteroid redirection test dart a mission to test technology for defending earth against potential hazardous objects dart deliberately crashed into the minorplanet moon dimorphos of the double asteroid didymos in september 2022 to assess the potential of a spacecraft impact to deflect an asteroid from a collision course with earth in october nasa declared dart a success confirming it had shortened dimorphos orbital period around didymos by about 32 minutes planned missions asteroid mining the concept of asteroid mining was proposed in 1970s matt anderson defines successful asteroid mining as the development of a mining program that is both financially selfsustaining and profitable to its investors it has been suggested that asteroids might be used as a source of materials that may be rare or exhausted on earth or materials for constructing space habitats materials that are heavy and expensive to launch from earth may someday be mined from asteroids and used for space manufacturing and construction as resource depletion on earth becomes more real the idea of extracting valuable elements from asteroids and returning these to earth for profit or using spacebased resources to build solarpower satellites and space habitats becomes more attractive hypothetically water processed from ice could refuel orbiting propellant depots from the astrobiological perspective asteroid prospecting could provide scientific data for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence seti some astrophysicists have suggested that if advanced extraterrestrial civilizations employed asteroid mining long ago the hallmarks of these activities might be detectable threats to earth there is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross earths and that could given enough time collide with earth the three most important groups of nearearth asteroids are the apollos amors and atens the nearearth asteroid 433 eros had been discovered as long ago as 1898 and the 1930s brought a flurry of similar objects in order of discovery these were 1221 amor 1862 apollo 2101 adonis and finally 69230 hermes which approached within 0005 au of earth in 1937 astronomers began to realize the possibilities of earth impact two events in later decades increased the alarm the increasing acceptance of the alvarez hypothesis that an impact event resulted in the cretaceouspaleogene extinction and the 1994 observation of comet shoemakerlevy 9 crashing into jupiter the us military also declassified the information that its military satellites built to detect nuclear explosions had detected hundreds of upperatmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to ten meters across all of these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient surveys consisting of chargecoupled device ccd cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes 2011 it was estimated that 89 to 96 of nearearth asteroids one kilometer or larger in diameter had been discovered 2018 the linear system alone had discovered 147132 asteroids among the surveys 19266 nearearth asteroids have been discovered including almost 900 more than 1 in diameter in june 2018 the national science and technology council warned that the united states is unprepared for an asteroid impact event and has developed and released the national nearearth object preparedness strategy action plan to better prepare according to expert testimony in the united states congress in 2013 nasa would require at least five years of preparation before a mission to intercept an asteroid could be launched asteroid deflection strategies various collision avoidance techniques have different tradeoffs with respect to metrics such as overall performance cost failure risks operations and technology readiness there are various methods for changing the course of an asteroidcomet these can be differentiated by various types of attributes such as the type of mitigation deflection or fragmentation energy source kinetic electromagnetic gravitational solarthermal or nuclear and approach strategy interception20160126interception rendezvous or remote station strategies fall into two basic sets fragmentation and delay fragmentation concentrates on rendering the impactor harmless by fragmenting it and scattering the fragments so that they miss the earth or are small enough to burn up in the atmosphere delay exploits the fact that both the earth and the impactor are in orbit an impact occurs when both reach the same point in space at the same time or more correctly when some point on earths surface intersects the impactors orbit when the impactor arrives since the earth is approximately 12750 km in diameter and moves at approx 30 km per second in its orbit it travels a distance of one planetary diameter in about 425 seconds or slightly over seven minutes delaying or advancing the impactors arrival by times of this magnitude can depending on the exact geometry of the impact cause it to miss the earth project icarus was one of the first projects designed in 1967 as a contingency plan in case of collision with 1566 icarus the plan relied on the new saturn v rocket which did not make its first flight until after the report had been completed six saturn v rockets would be used each launched at variable intervals from months to hours away from impact each rocket was to be fitted with a single 100megaton nuclear warhead as well as a modified apollo service module and uncrewed apollo command module for guidance to the target the warheads would be detonated 30 meters from the surface deflecting or partially destroying the asteroid depending on the subsequent impacts on the course or the destruction of the asteroid later missions would be modified or cancelled as needed the lastditch launch of the sixth rocket would be 18 hours prior to impact fiction asteroids and the asteroid belt are a staple of science fiction stories asteroids play several potential roles in science fiction as places human beings might colonize resources for extracting minerals hazards encountered by spacecraft traveling between two other points and as a threat to life on earth or other inhabited planets dwarf planets and natural satellites by potential impact see also notes references further reading external links allocution categories criminal procedure evidence law an allocution or allocutus is a formal statement made to the court by the defendant who has been found guilty prior to being sentenced it is part of the criminal procedure in some jurisdictions using common law concept an allocution allows the defendant to explain why the sentence should be lenient in plea bargains an allocution may be required of the defendant the defendant explicitly admits specifically and in detail the actions and their reasons in exchange for a reduced sentence in principle that removes any doubt as to the exact nature of the defendants guilt in the matter the term allocution is used generally only in jurisdictions in the united states but there are vaguely similar processes in other common law countries in many other jurisdictions it is for the defense lawyer to mitigate on their clients behalf and the defendant rarely has the opportunity to speak australia in australia the term allocutus is used by the clerk of arraigns or another formal associate of the court it is generally phrased as prisoner at the bar you have been found guilty by a jury of your peers of the offence of xyz do you have anything to say as to why the sentence of this court should not now be passed upon you the defense counsel will then make a plea in mitigation also called submissions on penalty in an attempt to mitigate the relative seriousness of the offense and heavily refer to and rely upon the defendants previous good character and good works if any the right to make a plea in mitigation is absolute if a judge or magistrate refuses to hear such a plea or does not properly consider it the sentence can be overturned on appeal united states in most of the united states defendants are allowed the opportunity to allocute before a sentence is passed some jurisdictions hold that as an absolute right in its absence a sentence but not the conviction may be overturned resulting in the need for a new sentencing hearing in the federal system federal rules of criminal procedure 32i4 provides that the court must address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence the federal public defender recommends that defendants speak in terms of how a lenient sentence will be sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory directives set forth in 18 see also references affidavit categories

under an oath or affirmation which is administered by a person who is authorized to do so by law such a statement is witnessed as to the authenticity of the affiants signature by a taker of oaths such as a notary public or commissioner of oaths an affidavit is a type of verified statement or showing or in other words it contains a verification which means that it is made under oath on penalty of perjury and this serves as evidence for its veracity and is required in court proceedings definition an affidavit is typically defined as a written declaration or statement that is sworn or affirmed before a person who has authority to administer an oath there is no general defined form for an affidavit although for some proceedings an affidavit must satisfy legal or statutory requirements in order to be considered an affidavit may include in some cases an introductory clause called a preamble is added attesting that the affiant personally appeared before the authenticating authority an affidavit may also recite that the statement it records was made under penalty of perjury an affidavit that is prepared for use within the context of litigation may also include a caption that identifies the venue and parties to the relevant judicial proceedings worldwide australia on 2 march 2016 the high court of australia held that the act uniform evidence legislation is neutral in the way sworn evidence and unsworn evidence is treated as being of equal weight united kingdom the term affidavit is used in the uk according the uk government website the affidavit can be sworn or

therein the courts have no jurisdiction to admit evidence by way of affidavit affidavit is not treated as evidence within the meaning of section 3 of the evidence act however it was held by the supreme court that an affidavit can be used as evidence only if the court so orders for sufficient reasons namely the right of the opposite party to have the deponent produced for crossexamination therefore an affidavit cannot ordinarily be used as evidence in absence of a specific order of the court sri lanka in sri lanka under the oaths ordinance with the exception of a courtmartial a person may submit an affidavit signed in the presence of a commissioner for oaths or a justice of the peace ireland affidavits are made in a similar way as to england and wales although make oath is sometimes omitted an affirmed affidavit may be substituted for an sworn affidavit in most cases for those opposed to swearing oaths the person making the affidavit is known as the deponent and signs

rejected when the name cannot be ascertained in august 2020 a new method of filing affidavits came into force under section 21 of the civil law and criminal law miscellaneous provisions act 2020 witnesses are no longer required to swear before god or make an affirmation when filing an affidavit instead witnesses will make a nonreligious statement of truth and if it is breached will be liable for up to one year in prison if convicted summarily or upon conviction on indictment to a maximum fine of 250000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both this is designed to replace affidavits and statutory declarations in situations where the electronic means of lodgement or filing of documents with the court provided for in section 20 is utilised as of january 2022 it has yet to be adopted widely and it is expected it will not be used for some time by lay litigants who will still lodge papers in person united states in american jurisprudence under the rules for hearsay admission of an unsupported affidavit as evidence is unusual especially if the affiant is not available for crossexamination with regard to material facts which may be dispositive of the matter at bar affidavits from persons who are dead or otherwise incapacitated or who cannot be located or made to appear may be accepted by the court but usually only in the presence of corroborating evidence an affidavit which reflected a better grasp of the facts close in time to the actual events may be used to refresh a witnesss recollection materials used to refresh recollection are admissible as evidence if the affiant is a party in the case the affiants opponent may be successful in having the affidavit admitted as evidence as statements by a partyopponent are admissible through an exception

person signs an affidavit that person is eligible to take the stand at a trial or evidentiary hearing one party may wish to summon the affiant to verify the contents of the affidavit while the other party may want to crossexamine the affiant about the affidavit some types of motions will not be accepted by the court unless accompanied by an independent sworn statement or other evidence in support of the need for the motion in such a case a court will accept an affidavit from the filing attorney in support of the motion as certain assumptions are made to wit the affidavit in place of sworn testimony promotes judicial economy the lawyer is an officer of the court and knows that a false swearing by them if found out could be grounds for severe penalty up to and including disbarment the lawyer if called upon would be able to present independent and more detailed evidence to prove the facts set forth in his affidavit affidavits should not be confused with unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury in federal courts and about 20 states as of 2006 unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury are authorized by statute as acceptable in lieu of affidavits the key differences are that an unsworn declaration does not bear the jurat of a notary public and the declarant is not required to swear an oath or affirmation rather the signature of the declarant under a carefully worded phrase binding them to the truth of their statements under penalty of perjury is deemed as a matter of law to be sufficiently solemn to remind the declarant of their duty to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the point of such affidavit substitution statutes is that unsworn declarations can be prepared and executed far more quickly and economically than affidavits in that the witness need not meet personally with a notary public for the notarization process the acceptance of an affidavit by one society does not confirm its acceptance as a legal document in other jurisdictions equally the acceptance that a lawyer is an officer of the court for swearing the affidavit is not a given this matter is addressed by the use of the apostille a means of certifying the legalization of a document for international use under the terms of the 1961 hague convention abolishing the requirement of legalization for foreign public documents documents which have been notarized by a notary public and certain other documents and then certified with a conformant apostille are accepted for legal use in all the nations that have signed the hague convention thus most affidavits now require to be apostilled if used for cross border issues see also references aries constellation categories aries constellation constellations constellations listed by ptolemy northern constellations aries is one of the constellations of the zodiac it is located in the northern celestial hemisphere between pisces to the west and taurus to the east the name aries is latin for ram its old astronomical symbol is 20px  it is one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations it is a midsized constellation ranking 39th in overall size with an area of 441 square degrees 11 of the celestial sphere aries has represented a ram since late babylonian times before that the stars of aries formed a farmhand different cultures have incorporated the stars of aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in china and a porpoise in the marshall islands aries is a relatively dim constellation possessing only four bright stars hamal alpha arietis second magnitude sheratan beta arietis third magnitude mesarthim gamma arietis fourth magnitude and 41 arietis also fourth magnitude the few deepsky objects within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies several meteor showers appear to radiate from aries including the daytime arietids and the epsilon arietids history and mythology aries is now recognized as an official constellation albeit as a specific region of the sky by the international astronomical union it was originally defined in ancient texts as a specific pattern of stars and has remained a constellation since ancient times it now includes the ancient pattern and the surrounding stars in the description of the babylonian zodiac given in the clay tablets known as the mulapin the constellation now known as aries was the final station along the ecliptic the mulapin was a comprehensive table of the rising and settings of stars which likely served as an agricultural calendar modernday aries was known as mullúḫungá the agrarian worker or the hired man although likely compiled in the 12th or 11th century bc the mulapin reflects a tradition that marks the pleiades as the vernal equinox which was the case with some precision at the beginning of the middle bronze age the earliest identifiable reference to aries as a distinct constellation comes from the boundary stones that date from 1350 to 1000 bc on several boundary stones a zodiacal ram figure is distinct from the other characters the shift in identification from the constellation as the agrarian worker to the ram likely occurred in later babylonian tradition because of its growing association with dumuzi the shepherd by the time the mulapin was createdin 1000 bcmodern aries was identified with both dumuzis ram and a hired labourer the exact timing of this shift is difficult to determine due to the lack of images of aries or other ram figures in ancient egyptian astronomy aries was associated with the god amunra who was depicted as a man with a rams head and represented fertility and creativity because it was the location of the vernal equinox it was called the indicator of the reborn sun during the times of the year when aries was prominent priests would process statues of amonra to temples a practice that was modified by persian astronomers centuries later aries acquired the title of lord of the head in egypt referring to its symbolic and mythological importance aries was not fully accepted as a constellation until classical times in hellenistic astrology the constellation of aries is associated with the golden ram of greek mythology that rescued phrixus and helle on orders from hermes taking phrixus to the land of colchis phrixus and helle were the son and daughter of king athamas and his first wife nephele the kings second wife ino was jealous and wished to kill his children to accomplish this she induced famine in boeotia then falsified a message from the oracle of delphi that said phrixus must be sacrificed to end the famine athamas was about to sacrifice his son atop mount laphystium when aries sent by nephele arrived helle fell off of ariess back in flight and drowned in the dardanelles also called the hellespont in her honour historically aries has been depicted as a crouched wingless ram with its head turned towards taurus ptolemy asserted in his almagest that hipparchus depicted alpha arietis as the rams muzzle though ptolemy did not include it in his constellation figure instead it was listed as an unformed star and denoted as the star over the head john flamsteed in his atlas coelestis followed ptolemys description by mapping it above the figures head flamsteed followed the general convention of maps by depicting aries lying down astrologically aries has been associated with the head and its humors it was strongly associated with mars both the planet and the god it was considered to govern western europe and syria and to indicate a strong temper in a person the first point of aries the location of the vernal equinox is named for the constellation this is because the sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in aries more than two millennia ago hipparchus defined it in 130 bc as a point south of gamma arietis because of the precession of the equinoxes the first point of aries has since moved into pisces and will move into aquarius by around 2600 ad the sun now appears in aries from late april through midmay though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring medieval muslim astronomers depicted aries in various ways astronomers like alsufi saw the constellation as a ram modelled on the precedent of ptolemy however some islamic celestial globes depicted aries as a nondescript fourlegged animal with what may be antlers instead of horns some early bedouin observers saw a ram elsewhere in the sky this constellation featured the pleiades as the rams tail the generally accepted arabic formation of aries consisted of thirteen stars in a figure along with five unformed stars four of which were over the animals hindquarters and one of which was the disputed star over ariess head alsufis depiction differed from both other arab astronomers and flamsteeds in that his aries was running and looking behind itself the obsolete constellations apes vespa lilium and musca borealis all centred on the same four stars now known as 33 35 39 and 41 arietis in 1612 petrus plancius introduced apes a constellation representing a bee in 1624 the same stars were used by jakob bartsch for vespa representing a wasp in 1679 augustin royer used these stars for his constellation lilium representing the fleurdelis none of these constellations became widely accepted johann hevelius renamed the constellation musca in 1690 in his firmamentum sobiescianum to differentiate it from musca the southern fly it was later renamed musca borealis but it did not gain acceptance and its stars were ultimately officially reabsorbed into aries in 1922 the international astronomical union defined its recommended threeletter abbreviation ari the official boundaries of aries were defined in 1930 by eugène delporte as a polygon of 12 segments its right ascension is between 1h 464m and 3h 294m and its declination is between 1036 and 3122 in the equatorial coordinate system in nonwestern astronomy in traditional chinese astronomy stars from aries were used in several constellations the brightest starsalpha beta and gamma arietisformed a constellation called louvariously translated as bond or lasso also sickle which was associated with the ritual sacrifice of cattle this name was shared by the 16th lunar mansion the location of the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox this constellation has also been associated with harvesttime as it could represent a woman carrying a basket of food on her head 35 39 and 41 arietis were part of a constellation called wei 胃 which represented a fat abdomen and was the namesake of the 17th lunar mansion which represented granaries delta and zeta arietis were a part of the constellation tianyin 天陰 thought to represent the emperors hunting partner zuogeng 左更 a constellation depicting a marsh and pond inspector was composed of mu nu omicron pi and sigma arietis he was accompanied by yeoukang a constellation depicting an official in charge of pasture distribution in a similar system to the chinese the first lunar mansion in hindu astronomy was called aswini after the traditional names for beta and gamma arietis the aswins because the hindu new year began with the vernal equinox the rig veda contains over 50 newyears related hymns to the twins making them some of the most prominent characters in the work aries itself was known as aja and mesha in hebrew astronomy aries was named taleh it signified either simeon or gad and generally symbolizes the lamb of the world the neighboring syrians named the constellation amru and the bordering turks named it kuzi half a world away in the marshall islands several stars from aries were incorporated into a constellation depicting a porpoise along with stars from cassiopeia andromeda and triangulum alpha beta and gamma arietis formed the head of the porpoise while stars from andromeda formed the body and the bright stars of cassiopeia formed the tail other polynesian peoples recognized aries as a constellation the marquesas islanders called it napaika the māori constellation pipiri may correspond to modern aries as well in indigenous peruvian astronomy a constellation with most of the same stars as aries existed it was called the market moon and the kneeling terrace as a reminder of when to hold the annual harvest festival ayri huay features stars bright stars aries has three prominent stars forming an asterism designated alpha beta and gamma arietis by johann bayer alpha hamal and beta sheratan are commonly used for navigation there is also one other star above the fourth magnitude 41 arietis bharani α arietis called hamal is the brightest star in aries its traditional name is derived from the arabic word for lamb or head of the ram ras alhamal which references ariess mythological background with a spectral class of k2 and a luminosity class of iii it is an orange giant with an apparent visual magnitude of 200 which lies 66 lightyears from earth hamal has a luminosity of 96 and its absolute magnitude is 01 β arietis also known as sheratan is a bluewhite star with an apparent visual magnitude of 264 its traditional name is derived from sharatayn the arabic word for the two signs referring to both beta and gamma arietis in their position as heralds of the vernal equinox the two stars were known to the bedouin as qarna alhamal horns of the ram it is 59 lightyears from earth it has a luminosity of 11 and its absolute magnitude is 21 it is a spectroscopic binary star one in which the companion star is only known through analysis of the spectra the spectral class of the primary is a5 hermann carl vogel determined that sheratan was a spectroscopic binary in 1903 its orbit was determined by hans ludendorff in 1907 it has since been studied for its eccentric orbit γ arietis with a common name of mesarthim is a binary star with two whitehued components located in a rich field of magnitude 812 stars its traditional name has conflicting derivations it may be derived from a corruption of alsharatan the arabic word meaning pair or a word for fat ram however it may also come from the sanskrit for first star of aries or the hebrew for ministerial servants both of which are unusual languages of origin for star names along with beta arietis it was known to the bedouin as qarna alhamal the primary is of magnitude 459 and the secondary is of magnitude 468 the system is 164 lightyears from earth the two components are separated by 78 arcseconds and the system as a whole has an apparent magnitude of 39 the primary has a luminosity of 60 and the secondary has a luminosity of 56 the primary is an atype star with an absolute magnitude of 02 and the secondary is a b9type star with an absolute magnitude of 04 the angle between the two components is 1 mesarthim was discovered to be a double star by robert hooke in 1664 one of the earliest such telescopic discoveries the primary γ1 arietis is an alpha² canum venaticorum variable star that has a range of 002 magnitudes and a period of 2607 days it is unusual because of its strong silicon

prototype of its class helium variable stars sx arietis stars have very prominent emission lines of helium i and silicon iii they are normally mainsequence b0pb9p stars and their variations are not usually visible to the naked eye therefore they are observed photometrically usually having periods that fit in the course of one night similar to α2s sx arietis stars have periodic changes in their light and magnetic field which correspond to the periodic rotation they differ from the α2 canum venaticorum variables in their higher temperature there are between 39 and 49 sx arietis variable stars currently known ten are noted as being uncertain in the general catalog of variable stars deep sky objects ngc 772 is a spiral galaxy with an integrated magnitude of 103 located southeast of β arietis and 15 arcminutes west of 15 arietis it is a relatively bright galaxy and shows obvious nebulosity and ellipticity in an amateur telescope it is 72 by 42 arcminutes meaning that its surface brightness magnitude 136 is significantly lower than its integrated magnitude ngc 772 is a class sasb galaxy which means that it is an unbarred spiral galaxy without a ring that possesses a somewhat prominent bulge and spiral arms that are wound somewhat tightly the main arm on the northwest side of the galaxy is home to many star forming regions this is due to previous gravitational interactions with other galaxies ngc 772 has a small companion galaxy ngc 770 that is about 113000 lightyears away from the larger galaxy the two galaxies together are also classified as arp 78 in the arp peculiar galaxy catalog ngc 772 has a diameter of 240000 lightyears and the system is 114 million lightyears from earth another spiral galaxy in aries is ngc 673 a faceon class sabsc galaxy it is a weakly barred spiral galaxy with loosely wound arms it has no ring and a faint bulge and is 25 by 19 arcminutes it has two primary arms with fragments located farther from the core 171000 lightyears in diameter ngc 673 is 235 million lightyears from earth ngc 678 and ngc 680 are a pair of galaxies in aries that are only about 200000 lightyears apart part of the ngc 691 group of galaxies both are at

at magnitude 129 ngc 678 has a magnitude of 1335 both galaxies have bright cores but ngc 678 is the larger galaxy at a diameter of 171000 lightyears ngc 680 has a diameter of 72000 lightyears ngc 678 is further distinguished by its prominent dust lane ngc 691 itself is a spiral galaxy slightly inclined to our line of sight it has multiple spiral arms and a bright core because it is so diffuse it has a low surface brightness it has a diameter of 126000 lightyears and is 124 million lightyears away ngc 877 is the brightest member of an 8galaxy group that also includes ngc 870 ngc 871 and ngc

of ngc 877 they are interacting gravitationally as they are connected by a faint stream of gas and dust arp 276 is a different pair of interacting galaxies in aries consisting of ngc 935 and ic 1801 ngc 821 is an e6 elliptical galaxy it is unusual because it has hints of an early spiral structure which is normally only found in lenticular and spiral galaxies ngc 821 is 26 by 20 arcminutes and has a visual magnitude of 113 its diameter is 61000 lightyears and it is 80 million lightyears away another unusual galaxy in aries is segue 2 a dwarf and satellite galaxy of the milky way recently discovered to be a potential relic of the epoch of reionization meteor showers aries is home to several meteor showers the daytime arietid meteor shower is one of the strongest meteor showers that occurs during the day lasting from 22 may to 2 july it is an annual shower associated with the marsden group of comets that peaks on 7 june with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 54 meteors its parent body may be the asteroid icarus the meteors are sometimes visible before dawn because the radiant is 32 degrees away from the sun they usually appear at a rate of 12 per hour as earthgrazers meteors that last several seconds and often begin at the horizon because most of the daytime arietids are not visible to the naked eye they are observed in the radio spectrum this is possible because of the ionized gas they leave in their wake other meteor showers radiate from aries during the day these include the daytime epsilon arietids and the northern and southern daytime may arietids the jodrell bank observatory discovered the daytime arietids in 1947 when james hey and g s stewart adapted the world war iiera radar systems for meteor observations the delta arietids are another meteor shower radiating from aries peaking on 9 december with a low peak rate the shower lasts from 8 december to 14 january with the highest rates visible from 8 to 14 december the average delta arietid meteor is very slow with an average velocity of 132 per second however this shower sometimes produces bright fireballs this meteor shower has northern and southern components both of which are likely associated with 1990 ha a nearearth asteroid the autumn arietids also radiate from aries the shower lasts from 7 september to 27 october and peaks on 9 october its peak rate is low the epsilon arietids appear from 12 to 23 october other meteor showers radiating from aries include the october delta arietids daytime epsilon arietids daytime may arietids sigma arietids nu arietids and beta arietids the sigma arietids a class iv meteor shower are visible from 12 to 19 october with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of less than two meteors per hour on 19 october planetary systems aries contains several stars with extrasolar planets hip 14810 a g5 type star is orbited by three giant planets those more than ten times the mass of earth hd 12661 like hip 14810 is a gtype main sequence star slightly larger than the sun with two orbiting planets one planet is 23 times the mass of jupiter and the other is 157 times the mass of jupiter hd 20367 is a g0 type star approximately the size of the sun with one orbiting planet the planet discovered in 2002 has a mass 107 times that of jupiter and orbits every 500 days in 2019 scientists conducting the carmenes survey at the calar alto observatory announced evidence of two earthmass exoplanets orbiting teegardens star located in aries within its habitable zone the star is a small red dwarf with only around a tenth of the mass and radius of the sun it has a large radial velocity see also references explanatory notes citations bibliography online sources simbad external links aquarius constellation categories aquarius constellation constellations equatorial constellations constellations listed by ptolemy aquarius is an equatorial constellation of the zodiac between capricornus and pisces its name is latin for watercarrier or cupcarrier and its old astronomical symbol is 20px  a representation of water aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the zodiac the suns apparent path it was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer ptolemy and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations it is found in a region often called the sea due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as cetus the whale pisces the fish and eridanus the river at apparent magnitude 29 beta aquarii is the brightest star in the constellation history and mythology aquarius is identified as gula the great one in the babylonian star catalogues and represents the god ea himself who is commonly depicted holding an overflowing vase the babylonian starfigure appears on entitlement stones and cylinder seals from the second millennium it contained the winter solstice in the early bronze age in old babylonian astronomy ea was the ruler of the southernmost quarter of the suns path the way of ea corresponding to the period of 45 days on either side of winter solstice aquarius was also associated with the destructive floods that the babylonians regularly experienced and thus was negatively connoted in ancient egypt astronomy aquarius was associated with the annual flood of the nile the banks were said to flood when aquarius put his jar into the river beginning spring in the greek tradition the constellation came to be represented simply as a single vase from which a stream poured down to piscis austrinus the name in the hindu zodiac is likewise kumbha waterpitcher in greek mythology aquarius is sometimes associated with deucalion the son of prometheus who built a ship with his wife pyrrha to survive an imminent flood they sailed for nine days before washing ashore on mount parnassus aquarius is also sometimes identified with beautiful ganymede a youth in greek mythology and the son of trojan king tros who was taken to mount olympus by zeus to act as cupcarrier to the gods neighboring aquila represents the eagle under zeus command that snatched the young boy some versions of the myth indicate that the eagle was in fact zeus transformed an alternative version of the tale recounts ganymedes kidnapping by the goddess of the dawn eos motivated by her affection for young men zeus then stole him from eos and employed him as cupbearer yet another figure associated with the water bearer is cecrops i a king of athens who sacrificed water instead of wine to the gods depictions in the first century ptolemys almagest established the common western depiction of aquarius his water jar an asterism itself consists of gamma pi eta and zeta aquarii it pours water in a stream of more than 20 stars terminating with fomalhaut now assigned solely to piscis austrinus the water bearers head is represented by 5th magnitude 25 aquarii while his left shoulder is beta aquarii his right shoulder and forearm are represented by alpha and gamma aquarii respectively in eastern astronomy in chinese astronomy the stream of water flowing from the water jar was depicted as the army of yulin yulimkiun or yulinjun hanzi 羽林君 the name yulin means feathers and forests referring to the numerous lightfooted soldiers from the northern reaches of the empire represented by these faint stars the constellations stars were the most numerous of any chinese constellation numbering 45 the majority of which were located in modern aquarius the celestial army was protected by the wall leibizhen 垒壁阵 which counted iota lambda phi and sigma aquarii among its 12 stars 88 89 and 98 aquarii represent fouyoue the axes used as weapons and for hostage executions also in aquarius is louipitchin the ramparts that stretch from 29 and 27 piscium and 33 and 30 aquarii through phi lambda sigma and iota aquarii to delta gamma kappa and epsilon capricorni near the border with cetus the axe fuyue was represented by three stars its position is disputed and may have instead been located in sculptor tienliecheng also has a disputed position the 13star castle replete with ramparts may have possessed nu and xi aquarii but may instead have been located south in piscis austrinus the water jar asterism was seen to the ancient chinese as the tomb fenmu nearby the emperors mausoleum xiuliang stood demarcated by kappa aquarii and three other collinear stars ku crying and qi weeping each composed of two stars were located in the same region three of the chinese lunar mansions shared their name with constellations nu also the name for the 10th lunar mansion was a handmaiden represented by epsilon mu 3 and 4 aquarii the 11th lunar mansion shared its name with the constellation xu emptiness formed by beta aquarii and alpha equulei it represented a bleak place associated with death and funerals wei the rooftop and 12th lunar mansion was a vshaped constellation formed by alpha aquarii theta pegasi and epsilon pegasi it shared its name with two other chinese constellations in modernday scorpius and aries features stars despite both its prominent position on the zodiac and its large size aquarius has no particularly bright stars its four brightest stars being less than magnitude 2  however recent research has shown that there are several stars lying within its borders that possess planetary systems the two brightest stars α aquarii and β aquarii are luminous yellow supergiants of spectral types g0ib and g2ib respectively that were once hot bluewhite bclass main sequence stars 5 to 9 times as massive as the sun the two are also moving through space perpendicular to the plane of the milky way just shadingjune 2023 α β aquarii is the brightest star in aquarius with apparent magnitude 291  it also has the proper name of sadalsuud

masses and a radius of 087 solar radii wasp6 b was discovered in 2008 by the transit method it orbits its parent star every 336 days at a distance of 0042 astronomical units au it is 0503 jupiter masses but has a proportionally larger radius of 1224 jupiter radii hd 206610 a k0 star located 194 parsecs from earth is host to one planet hd 206610 b the host star is larger than the sun more massive at 156 solar masses and larger at 61 solar radii the planet was discovered by the radial velocity method in 2010 and has a mass of 22 jupiter masses it orbits every 610 days at a distance of

orbits at nearly the same distance as earth orbits the sun11 au though its orbital period is significantly longer at around 442 days hd 210277 b was discovered earlier than most of the other planets in aquarius detected by the radial velocity method in 1998 the star it orbits resembles the sun beyond their similar spectral class it has a radius of 11 solar radii and a mass of 109 solar masses hd 212771 b a larger planet at 23 jupiter masses orbits host star hd 212771 at a distance of 122 au the star itself barely below the threshold of nakedeye visibility at magnitude 76 is a g8iv yellow

2010 by the radial velocity method like several other exoplanets in the constellation as of 2013 there were only two known multipleplanet systems within the bounds of aquarius the gliese 876 and hd 215152 systems the former is quite prominent the latter has only two planets and has a host star farther away at 215 parsecs the hd 215152 system consists of the planets hd 215152 b and hd 215152 c orbiting their k0type magnitude 813 sun both discovered in 2011 by the radial velocity method the two tiny planets orbit very close to their host star hd 215152 c is the larger at 00097 jupiter masses still significantly larger than the earth which weighs in at 000315 jupiter masses its smaller sibling is barely smaller at 00087 jupiter masses the error in the mass measurements 00032 and 00049 respectively is large enough to make this discrepancy statistically insignificant hd 215152 c also orbits further from the star than hd 215152 b 00852 au compared to 00652 on 23 february 2017 nasa announced that ultracool dwarf star trappist1 in aquarius has seven earthlike rocky planets of these as many as four may lie within the systems habitable zone and may have liquid water on their surfaces the discovery of the trappist1 system is seen by astronomers as a significant step toward finding life beyond earth deep sky objects because of its position away from the galactic plane the majority of deepsky objects in aquarius are galaxies globular clusters and planetary nebulae aquarius contains three deep sky objects that are in the messier catalog the globular clusters messier 2 messier 72 and the asterism messier 73 while m73 was originally catalogued as a sparsely populated open cluster modern analysis indicates the 6 main stars are not close enough together to fit this definition reclassifying m73 as an asterism two wellknown planetary nebulae are also located in aquarius the saturn nebula ngc 7009 to the southeast of μ aquarii and the famous helix nebula ngc 7293 southwest of δ aquarii m2 also catalogued as ngc 7089 is a rich globular cluster located approximately 37000 lightyears from earth at magnitude 65 it is viewable in smallaperture instruments but a 100 mm aperture telescope is needed to resolve any stars m72 also catalogued as ngc 6981 is a small 9th magnitude globular cluster located approximately 56000 lightyears from earth m73 also catalogued as ngc 6994 is an open cluster with highly disputed status aquarius is also home to several planetary nebulae ngc 7009 also known as the saturn nebula is an 8th magnitude planetary nebula located 3000 lightyears from earth it was given its moniker by the 19th century astronomer lord rosse for its resemblance to the planet saturn in a telescope it has faint protrusions on either side that resemble saturns rings it appears bluegreen in a telescope and has a central star of magnitude 113 compared to the helix nebula another planetary nebula in aquarius it is quite small ngc 7293 also known as the helix nebula is the closest planetary nebula to earth at a distance of 650 lightyears it covers 025 square degrees making it also the largest planetary nebula as seen from earth however because it is so large it is only viewable as a very faint object though it has a fairly high integrated magnitude of 60 one of the visible galaxies in aquarius is ngc 7727 of particular interest for amateur astronomers who wish to discover or observe supernovae a spiral galaxy type s it has an integrated magnitude of 107 and is 3 by 3 arcseconds ngc 7252 is a tangle of stars resulting from the collision of two large galaxies and is known as the atomsforpeace galaxy because of its resemblance to a cartoon atom meteor showers there are three major meteor showers with radiants in aquarius the eta aquariids the delta aquariids and the iota aquariids the eta aquariids are the strongest meteor shower radiating from aquarius it peaks between 5 and 6 may with a rate of approximately 35 meteors per hour originally discovered by chinese astronomers in 401 eta aquariids can be seen coming from the water jar beginning on 21 april and as late as 12 may the parent body of the shower is halleys comet a periodic comet fireballs are common shortly after the peak approximately between 9 may and 11 may the normal meteors appear to have yellow trails the delta aquariids is a double radiant meteor shower that peaks first on 29 july and second on 6 august the first radiant is located in the south of the constellation while the second radiant is located in the northern circlet of pisces asterism the southern radiants peak rate is about 20 meteors per hour while the northern radiants peak rate is about 10 meteors per hour the iota aquariids is a fairly weak meteor shower that peaks on 6 august with a rate of approximately 8 meteors per hour astrology 2002 the sun appears in the constellation aquarius from 16 february to 12 march in tropical astrology the sun is considered to be in the sign aquarius from 20 january to 19 february and in sidereal astrology from 15 february to 14 march aquarius is also associated with the age of aquarius a concept popular in 1960s counterculture and medieval alchemy the date of the start of the age of aquarius is a topic of much debate notes see also references external links anime categories anime 1917 introductions anime and manga terminology

animation is written in japanese katakana as アニメーション ja and as アニメ ja aɲime in its shortened form some sources claim that the term is derived from the french term for animation dessin animé cartoon

portmanteau of japan and animation was prevalent throughout the 1970s and 1980s in the mid1980s the term anime began to supplant japanimation in general the latter term now only appears in period works where it is used to distinguish and identify japanese animation history precursors emakimono and shadow plays kagee are considered precursors of japanese animation emakimono was common in the eleventh century traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while the emakimono was unrolled from the right to left in chronological order as a moving panorama kagee was popular during the edo period and originated from the shadow plays of china magic lanterns from the netherlands were also popular in the eighteenth century the paper play called kamishibai surged in the twelfth century

inspiration for anime cartoonists kitzawa rakuten and okamoto ippei used film elements in their strips pioneers animation in japan began in the early 20th century when filmmakers started to experiment with techniques pioneered in france germany the united states and russia a claim for the earliest japanese animation is katsudō shashin 1907 a private work by an unknown creator in 1917 the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear animators such as ōten shimokawa seitarō kitayama and junichi kōuchi considered the fathers of anime produced numerous films the oldest surviving of which is kōuchis namakura gatana many early works were lost with the destruction of shimokawas warehouse in the 1923 great kantō earthquake by the mid1930s animation was wellestablished in japan as an alternative format to the liveaction industry it suffered competition from foreign producers such as disney and many animators including noburō ōfuji and yasuji murata continued to work with cheaper cutout animation rather than cel animation other creators including kenzō masaoka and mitsuyo seo nevertheless made great strides in technique benefiting from the patronage of the government which employed animators to produce educational shorts and propaganda in 1940 the government dissolved several artists organizations to form the shin nippon mangaka kyōkai the first talkie anime was chikara to onna no yo no naka 1933 a short film produced by masaoka the first featurelength anime film was momotaro sacred sailors 1945 produced by seo with a sponsorship from the imperial

characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today the giant robot genre also known as mecha for instance took shape under tezuka developed into the super robot genre under go nagai and others and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by yoshiyuki tomino who developed the real robot genre robot anime series such as gundam and super dimension fortress macross became instant classics in the 1980s and the genre remained one of the most popular in the following decades the bubble economy of the 1980s spurred a new era of highbudget and experimental anime films including nausicaä of the valley of the wind 1984 royal space force the wings of honnêamise 1987 and akira 1988 neon genesis evangelion 1995 a television series produced by gainax and directed by

ever nonenglish language series to earn the title of worlds most indemand tv show previously held by only the walking dead and game of thrones attributes anime differs from other forms of animation by its art styles methods of animation its production and its process visually anime works exhibit a wide variety of art styles differing between creators artists and studios while no single art style predominates anime as a whole they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation technique and character design anime is fundamentally characterized by the use of limited animation flat expression the suspension of time its thematic range the presence of historical figures its complex narrative line and above all a peculiar drawing style with characters characterized by large and oval eyes with very defined lines bright colors and reduced movement of the lips technique modern anime follows a typical animation production process involving storyboarding voice acting character design and cel production since the 1990s animators have increasingly used computer animation to improve the efficiency of the production process early anime works were experimental and consisted of images drawn on blackboards stop motion animation of paper cutouts and silhouette animation cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium in the 21st century the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by tadahito mochinaga kihachirō kawamoto and tomoyasu murata computers were integrated into the animation process in the 1990s with works such as ghost in the shell and princess mononoke mixing cel animation with computergenerated images fuji film a major cel production company announced it would stop cel production producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes prior to the digital era anime was produced with traditional animation methods using a pose to pose approach the majority of mainstream anime uses fewer expressive key frames and more inbetween animation japanese animation studios were pioneers of many limited animation techniques and have given anime a distinct set of conventions unlike disney animation where the emphasis is on the movement anime emphasizes the art quality and let limited animation techniques make up for the lack of time spent on movement such techniques are often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices anime scenes place emphasis on achieving threedimensional views and backgrounds are instrumental in creating the atmosphere of the work the backgrounds are not always invented and are occasionally based on real locations as exemplified in howls moving castle and the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya oppliger stated that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an allstar cast usually comes out looking tremendously impressive the cinematic effects of anime differentiates itself from the stage plays found in american animation anime is cinematically shot as if by camera including panning zooming distance and angle shots to more complex dynamic shots that would be difficult to produce in reality in anime the animation is produced before the voice acting contrary to american animation which does the voice acting first characters the body proportions of human anime characters tend to accurately reflect the proportions of the human body in reality the height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion head heights can vary but most anime characters are about seven to eight heads tall anime artists occasionally make deliberate modifications to body proportions to produce super deformed characters that feature a disproportionately small body compared to the head many super deformed characters are two to four heads tall some anime works like crayon shinchan completely disregard these proportions in such a way that they resemble caricatured western cartoons a common anime character design convention is exaggerated eye size the animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to osamu tezuka who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as betty boop who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes the artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth generally a mixture of a light shade the tone color and a dark shade is used cultural anthropologist rachel thorn argues that japanese animators and audiences do not perceive such stylized eyes as inherently more or less foreign however not all anime characters have large eyes for example the works of hayao miyazaki are known for having realistically proportioned eyes as well as realistic hair colors on their characters hair in anime is often unnaturally lively and colorful or uniquely styled the movement of hair in anime is exaggerated and hair actions is used to emphasize the action and emotions of characters for added visual effect poitras traces hairstyle color to cover illustrations on manga where eyecatching artwork and colorful tones are attractive for childrens manga despite being produced for a domestic market anime features characters whose race or nationality is not always defined and this is often a deliberate decision such as in the pokémon animated series anime and manga artists often draw from a common canon of iconic facial expression illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts these techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in western animation and they include a fixed iconography that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods for example a male character may develop a nosebleed when aroused a variety of visual symbols are employed including sweat drops to depict nervousness visible blushing for embarrassment or glowing eyes for an intense glare another recurring sight gag is the use of chibi deformed simplified character designs figures to comedically punctuate emotions like confusion or embarrassment music the opening and credits sequences of most anime television series are accompanied by jpop or jrock songs often by reputed bandsas written with the series in mindbut are also aimed at the general music market therefore they often allude only vaguely or not at all to the thematic settings or plot of the series also they are often used as incidental music insert songs in an episode in order to highlight particularly important scenesper wpamrssituational anime news networks encyclopedia is not a reliable source future funk a musical microgenre that evolved in the early 2010s from vaporwave with a french house euro disco influence heavily uses anime visuals and samples along with japanese city pop to build an aesthetic since the 2020s anime songs have experienced a rapid growth in global online

a diverse range of genres targeting an adult audience shoujo and shounen anime sometimes contain elements popular with children of all genders in an attempt to gain crossover appeal adult anime may feature a slower pace or greater plot complexity that younger audiences may typically find unappealing as well as adult themes and situations a subset of adult anime works featuring pornographic elements are labeled r18 in japan and are internationally known as hentai originating from pervert by contrast some anime subgenres incorporate ecchi sexual themes or undertones without depictions of sexual intercourse as typified in the comedic or harem genres due to its popularity among adolescent and adult anime enthusiasts the inclusion of such elements is considered a form of fan service some genres explore homosexual romances such as yaoi male homosexuality and yuri female homosexuality while often used in a pornographic context the terms yaoi and yuri can also be used broadly in a wider context to describe or focus on the themes or the development of the relationships themselves animes genre classification differs from other types of animation and does not lend itself to simple classification gilles poitras compared the labeling of gundam 0080 and its complex depiction of war as a giant robot anime akin to simply labeling war and peace a war novel science fiction is a major

news networks encyclopedia is not a reliable source the home distribution of anime releases was popularized in the 1980s with the vhs and laserdisc formats the vhs ntsc video format used in both japan and the united states is credited with aiding the rising popularity of anime in the 1990s the laserdisc and vhs formats were transcended by the dvd format which offered the unique advantages including multiple subtitling and dubbing tracks on the same disc the dvd format also has its drawbacks in its usage of region coding adopted by the industry to solve licensing piracy and export problems and restricted region indicated on the dvd player the video cd vcd format was popular in hong kong and taiwan but became only a minor format in the united states that was closely associated with bootleg copies a key characteristic of many anime television shows is serialization where a continuous story arc stretches over multiple episodes or seasons traditional american television had an episodic format with each episode typically consisting of a selfcontained story in contrast anime shows such as dragon ball z had a serialization format where continuous story arcs stretch over multiple episodes or seasons which distinguished them from traditional american television shows serialization has since also become a common characteristic of american streaming television shows during the peak tv era industry the animation industry consists of more than 430 production companies with some of the major studios including toei animation gainax madhouse gonzo sunrise bones tms entertainment nippon animation paworks studio pierrot production ig ufotable and studio ghibli many of the studios are organized into a trade association the association of japanese animations there is also a labor

anime episode can cost between us100000 and us300000 to produce in 2001 animation accounted for 7 of the japanese film market above the 46 market share for liveaction works the popularity and success of anime is seen through the profitability of the dvd market contributing nearly 70 of total sales according to a 2016 article on nikkei asian review japanese television stations have bought over 60 billion worth of anime from production companies over the past few years compared with under 20 billion from overseas there has been a rise in sales of shows to television stations in japan caused by late night anime with adults as the target demographic this type of anime is less popular outside japan being considered more of a niche product spirited away 2001 was the alltime highestgrossing film

name anime films represent a large part of the highestgrossing japanese films yearly in japan with 6 out of the top 10 in 2014 in 2015 and also in 2016 anime has to be licensed by companies in other countries in order to be legally released while anime has been licensed by its japanese owners for use outside japan since at least the 1960s the practice became wellestablished in the united states in the late 1970s to early 1980s when such tv series as gatchaman and captain harlock were licensed from their japanese parent companies for distribution in the us market the trend towards american distribution of anime continued into the 1980s with the licensing of titles such as voltron and the creation of new series such as robotech through the use of source material from several original series in the early 1990s several companies began to experiment with the licensing of less childoriented material some such as ad vision and central park media and its imprints achieved fairly substantial commercial success and went on to become major players in the now very lucrative american anime market others such as animeigo achieved limited success many companies created directly by japanese parent companies did not do as well most releasing only one or two titles before completing their american operations licenses are expensive often hundreds of thousands of dollars for one series and tens of thousands for one movie the prices vary widely for example jinki extend cost only 91000 to license while kurau phantom memory cost 960000 simulcast internet streaming rights can be cheaper with prices around 10002000 an episode but can also be more expensive with some series costing more than 200000 per episode the anime market for the united states was worth approximately 274 billion in 2009 dubbed animation began airing in the united states in 2000 on networks like the wb and cartoon networks adult swim in 2005 this resulted in five of the top ten anime titles having previously aired on cartoon network as a part of localization some editing of cultural references may occur to better follow the references of the nonjapanese culture the cost of english localization averages us10000 per episode the industry has been subject to both praise and condemnation for fansubs the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films fansubs which were originally distributed on vhs bootlegged cassettes in the 1980s have been freely available and disseminated online since the 1990s since this practice raises concerns for copyright and piracy issues fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten moral code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed they also try to encourage viewers to buy an official copy of the release once it comes out in english although fansubs typically continue to circulate through filesharing networks even so the laid back regulations of the japanese animation industry tend to overlook these issues allowing it to grow underground and thus increasing its popularity until there is a demand for official highquality releases for animation companies this has led to an increase in global popularity of japanese animation reaching 40 million in sales in 2004 since the 2010s anime has become a global multibillion industry setting a sales record in 2017 of 215 trillion 198 billion driven largely by demand from overseas audiences in 2019 japans anime industry was valued at 24 billion a year with 48 of that revenue coming from overseas

kishida promised to improve the working conditions and salary of all animators and creators working in the industry a few anime studios such as mappa have taken actions to improve the working conditions of their employees there has also been a slight increase in production costs and animator pays during the covid19 pandemic on april 27 2023 nippon anime film culture association nafca was officially founded the association aims to solve problems in the industry including the improvement of conditions of the workers globalization and cultural impact anime has become commercially profitable in western countries as demonstrated by early commercially successful western adaptations of anime such as astro boy and speed racer early american adaptions in the 1960s made japan expand into the continental european market first with productions aimed at european and japanese children such as heidi vicky the viking and barbapapa which aired in various countries italy spain and france grew a particular interest in japans output due to its cheap selling price and productive output as of 2014 italy imported the most anime outside japan anime and manga were introduced to france in the late 1970s and became massively popular in spite of a moral panic led by french politicians in the 1980s and 1990s these mass imports influenced anime popularity in south american arabic and german markets the beginning of 1980september 2023 saw the introduction of japanese anime series into the american culture in the 1990s japanese animation slowly gained popularity in america media companies such as viz and mixx began publishing and releasing animation into the american market the 1988 film akira is largely credited with popularizing anime in the western world during the early 1990s before anime was further popularized by television shows such as pokémon and dragon ball z in the late 1990s by 1997 japanese anime was the fastestgrowing genre in the american video industry the growth of the internet later provided international audiences with an easy way to access japanese content early on online piracy played a major role in this through over time many legal alternatives appeared since the 2010s various streaming services have become increasingly involved in the production and licensing of anime for the international markets this is especially the case with net services such as netflix and crunchyroll which have large catalogs in western countries although as of 2020 anime fans in many developing nonwestern countries such as india and philippines have fewer options for obtaining access to legal content and therefore still turn to online piracy however beginning with the 2020s anime has been experiencing yet another boom in global popularity and demand due to the covid19 pandemic and streaming services like netflix amazon prime video hbo max disney hulu and animeonly services like crunchyroll and hidive increasing the international availability of

university students in the united kingdom wanting to get a degree in the japanese language the word anime alongside other japanese pop cultural terms like shonen and shojo have been added to the oxford english dictionary various anime and manga series have influenced hollywood in the making of numerous famous movies and characters hollywood itself has produced liveaction adaptations of various anime series such as ghost in the shell death note dragon ball evolution and cowboy bebop however most of these adaptations have been reviewed negatively by both the critics and the audience and have become boxoffice flops the main reasons for the unsuccessfulness of hollywoods adaptions of anime being the often change of plot and characters from the original source material and the limited capabilities a liveaction movie or series can do in comparison to an animated counterpart one particular exception however is alita battle angel which has become a moderate commercial success receiving generally positive reviews from both the critics and the audience for its visual effects and following the source material the movie grossed 404 million worldwide making it director robert

1920 the grand national assembly of turkey was established in ankara which became the headquarters of the turkish national movement during the turkish war of independence ankara became the new turkish capital upon the establishment of the republic on 29 october 1923 succeeding in this role as the former turkish capital istanbul following the fall of the ottoman empire the government is a prominent employer but ankara is also an important commercial and industrial city located at the center of turkeys road and railway networks the city gave its name to the angora wool shorn from angora rabbits the longhaired angora goat the source of mohair and the angora cat the area is also known for its pears honey and muscat grapes although situated in one of the driest regions of turkey and surrounded mostly by steppe vegetation except for the forested areas on the southern periphery ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per inhabitant at 72 per head etymology the orthography of the name ankara has varied over the ages it has been identified with the hittite cult center ankuwaš although this remains a matter of debate in classical antiquity and during the medieval period the city was known as ánkyra ἄγκυρα lit anchor in greek and ancyra in latin the galatian celtic name was probably a similar variant following its annexation by the seljuk turks in 1073 the city became known in many european languages as angora it was also known in ottoman turkish as engürü انگورو the form angora is preserved in the names of breeds of many different kinds of animals and in the names of several locations in the us see angora history the regions history can be traced back to the bronze age hattic civilization which was succeeded in the 2nd millennium bc by the hittites in the 10th century bc by the phrygians and later by the lydians persians greeks galatians romans byzantines and turks the seljuk sultanate of rûm the ottoman empire and finally republican turkey ancient history the oldest settlements in and around the city center of ankara belonged to the hattic civilization which existed during the bronze age and was gradually absorbed c 2000  1700 bc by the indoeuropean hittites the city grew significantly in size and importance under the phrygians starting around 1000 bc and experienced a large expansion following the mass migration from gordion the capital of phrygia after an earthquake which severely damaged that city around that time in phrygian tradition king midas was venerated as the founder of ancyra but pausanias mentions that the city was actually far older which accords with present archeological knowledge phrygian rule was succeeded first by lydian and later by persian rule though the strongly phrygian character of the peasantry remained as evidenced by the gravestones of the much later roman period persian sovereignty lasted until the persians defeat at the hands of alexander the great who conquered the city in 333 bc alexander came from gordion to ankara and stayed in the city for a short period after his death at babylon in 323 bc and the subsequent division of his empire among his generals ankara and its environs fell into the share of antigonus another important expansion took place under the greeks of pontos who came there around 300 bc and developed the city as a trading center for the commerce of goods between the black sea ports and crimea to the north assyria cyprus and lebanon to the south and georgia armenia and persia to the eastoctober 2023 by that timeoctober 2023 the city also took its name ἄγκυρα ánkyra meaning anchor in greek which in slightly modified form provides the modern name of ankara celtic history in 278 bc the city along with the rest of central anatolia was occupied by a celtic group the galatians who were the first to make ankara one of their main tribal centers the headquarters of the tectosages tribe other centers were pessinus todays ballıhisar for the trocmi tribe and tavium to the east of ankara for the tolistobogii tribe the city was then known as ancyra the celtic element was probably relatively small in numbers a warrior aristocracy which ruled over phrygianspeaking peasants however the celtic language continued to be spoken in galatia for many centuries at the end of the 4th century st jerome a native of dalmatia observed that the language spoken around ankara was very similar to that being spoken in the northwest of the roman world near trier roman history the city was subsequently passed under the control of the roman empire in 25 bc emperor augustus raised it to the status of a polis and made it the capital city of the roman province of galatia ankara is famous for the monumentum ancyranum temple of augustus and rome which contains the official record of the acts of augustus known as the res gestae divi augusti an inscription cut in marble on the walls of this temple the ruins of ancyra still furnish today valuable basreliefs inscriptions and other architectural fragments two other galatian tribal centers tavium near yozgat and pessinus balhisar to the west near sivrihisar continued to be reasonably important settlements in the roman period but it was ancyra that grew into a grand metropolis an estimated 200000 people lived in ancyra in good times during the roman empire a far greater number than was to be the case from after the fall of the roman empire until the early 20th century the small ankara river ran through the center of the roman town it has now been covered and diverted but it formed the northern boundary of the old town during the roman byzantine and ottoman periods çankaya the rim of the majestic hill to the south of the present city center stood well outside the roman city but may have been a summer resort in the 19th century the remains of at least one roman villa or large house were still standing not far from where the çankaya presidential residence stands today to the west the roman city extended until the area of the gençlik park and railway station while on the southern side of the hill it may have extended downward as far as the site presently occupied by hacettepe university it was thus a sizeable city by any standards and much larger than the roman towns of gaul or britanniaoctober 2012 ancyras importance rested on the fact that it was the junction point where the roads in northern anatolia running northsouth and eastwest intersected giving it major strategic importance for romes eastern frontier the great imperial road running east passed through ankara and a succession of emperors and their armies came this way they were not the only ones to use the roman highway network which was equally convenient for invaders in the second half of the 3rd century ancyra was invaded in rapid succession by the goths coming from the west who rode far into the heart of cappadocia taking slaves and pillaging and later by the arabs for about a decade the town was one of the western outposts of one of palmyrean empress zenobia in the syrian desert who took advantage of a period of weakness and disorder in the roman empire to set up a shortlived state of her own the town was reincorporated into the roman empire under emperor aurelian in 272 the tetrarchy a system of multiple up to four emperors introduced by diocletian 284305 seems to have engaged in a substantial program of rebuilding and of road construction from ancyra westwards to germe and dorylaeum now eskişehir in its heyday roman ancyra was a large market and trading center but it also functioned as a major administrative capital where a high official ruled from the citys praetorium a large administrative palace or office during the 3rd century life in ancyra as in other anatolian towns seems to have become somewhat militarized in response to the invasions and instability of the town byzantine history the city is well known during the 4th century as a center of christian activity see also below due to frequent imperial visits and through the letters of the pagan scholar libanius bishop marcellus of ancyra and basil of ancyra were active in the theological controversies of their day and the city was the site of no fewer than three church synods in 314 358 and 375 the latter two in favor of arianism the city was visited by emperor constans i r 337350 in 347 and 350 julian r 361363 during his persian campaign in 362 and julians successor jovian r 363364 in winter 363364 he entered his consulship while in the city after jovians death soon after valentinian i r 364375 was acclaimed emperor at ancyra and in the next year his brother valens r 364378 used ancyra as his base against the usurper procopius when the province of galatia was divided sometime in 39699 ancyra remained the civil capital of galatia i as well as its ecclesiastical center metropolitan see emperor arcadius r 383408 frequently used the city as his summer residence and some information about the ecclesiastical affairs of the city during the early 5th century is found in the works of palladius of galatia and nilus of ancyra in 479 the rebel marcian attacked the city without being able to capture it in 61011 comentiolus brother of emperor phocas r 602610 launched his own unsuccessful rebellion in the city against heraclius r 610641 ten years later in 620 or more likely 622 it was captured by the sassanid persians during the byzantinesassanid war of 602628 although the city returned to byzantine hands after the end of the war the persian presence left traces in the citys archeology and likely began the process of its transformation from a late antique city to a medieval fortified settlement in 654 the city also known in arabic sources as qalat assalasil fortress of the chains was captured for the first time by the arabs of the rashidun caliphate under muawiyah the future founder of the umayyad caliphate at about the same time the themes were established in anatolia and ancyra became capital of the opsician theme which was the largest and most important theme until it was split up under emperor constantine v r 741775 ancyra then became the capital of the new bucellarian theme the city was captured at least temporarily by the umayyad prince maslama ibn hisham in 73940 the last of the umayyads territorial gains from the byzantine empire ancyra was attacked without success by abbasid forces in 776 and in 79899 in 805 emperor nikephoros i r 802811 strengthened its fortifications a fact which probably saved it from sack during the largescale invasion of anatolia by caliph harun alrashid in the next year arab sources report that harun and his successor almamun r 813833 took the city but this information is later invention in 838 however during the amorium campaign the armies of caliph almutasim r 833842 converged and met at the city abandoned by its inhabitants ancara was razed to the ground before the arab armies went on to besiege and destroy amorium reaching as far as smyrna in 859 emperor michael iii r 842867 came to the city during a campaign against the arabs and ordered its fortifications restored in 872 the city was menaced but not taken by the paulicians under chrysocheir the last arab raid to reach the city was undertaken in 931 by the abbasid governor of tarsus thamal aldulafi but the city again was not captured ecclesiastical history early christian martyrs of ancyra about whom little is known included proklos and hilarios who were natives of the otherwise unknown nearby village of kallippi and suffered repression under the emperor trajan 98117 in the 280s we hear of philumenos a christian corn merchant from southern anatolia being captured and martyred in ankara and eustathius as in other roman towns the reign of diocletian marked the culmination of the persecution of the christians in 303 ancyra was one of the towns where the coemperors diocletian and his deputy galerius launched their antichristian persecution in ancyra their first target was the 38yearold bishop of the town whose name was clement clements life describes how he was taken to rome then sent back and forced to undergo many interrogations and hardship before he and his brother and various companions were put to death the remains of the church of st clement can be found today in a building just off işıklar caddesi in the ulus district quite possibly this marks the site where clement was originally buried four years later a doctor of the town named plato and his brother antiochus also became celebrated martyrs under galerius theodotus of ancyra is also venerated as a saint however the persecution proved unsuccessful and in 314 ancyra was the center of an important council of the early church its 25 disciplinary canons constitute one of the most important documents in the early history of the administration of the sacrament of penance the synod also considered ecclesiastical policy for the reconstruction of the christian church after the persecutions and in particular the treatment of lapsichristians who had given in to forced paganism sacrifices to avoid martyrdom during these persecutions though paganism was probably tottering in ancyra in clements day it may still have been the majority religion twenty years later christianity and monotheism had taken its place ancyra quickly turned into a christian city with a life dominated by monks and priests and theological disputes the town council or senate gave way to the bishop as the main local figurehead during the middle of the 4th century ancyra was involved in the complex theological disputes over the nature of christ and a form of arianism seems to have originated there in 362363 emperor julian passed through ancyra on his way to an illfated campaign against the persians and according to christian sources engaged in a persecution of various holy men the stone base for a statue with an inscription describing julian as lord of the whole world from the british ocean to the barbarian nations can still be seen built into the eastern side of the inner circuit of the walls of ankara castle the column of julian which was erected in honor of the emperors visit to the city in 362 still stands today in 375 arian bishops met at ancyra and deposed several bishops among them st gregory of nyssa in the late 4th century ancyra became something of an imperial holiday resort after constantinople became the east roman capital emperors in the 4th and 5th centuries would retire from the humid summer weather on the bosporus to the drier mountain atmosphere of ancyra theodosius ii 408450 kept his court in ancyra in the summers laws issued in ancyra testify to the time they spent there the metropolis of ancyra continued to be a residential see of the eastern orthodox church until the 20th century with about 40000 faithful mostly turkishspeaking but that situation ended as a result of the 1923 convention concerning the exchange of greek and turkish populations the earlier armenian genocide put an end to the residential eparchy of ancyra of the armenian catholic church which had been established in 1850 it is also a titular metropolis of the ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople both the ancient byzantine metropolitan archbishopric and the modern armenian eparchy are now listed by the catholic church as titular sees with separate apostolic successions seljuk and ottoman history after the battle of manzikert in 1071 the seljuk turks overran much of anatolia by 1073 the turkish settlers had reached the vicinity of ancyra and the city was captured shortly after at the latest by the time of the rebellion of nikephoros melissenos in 1081 in 1101 when the crusade under raymond iv of toulouse arrived the city had been under danishmend control for some time the crusaders captured the city and handed it over to the byzantine emperor alexios i komnenos r 10811118 byzantine rule did not last long and the city was captured by the seljuk sultanate of rum at some unknown point in 1127 it returned to danishmend control until 1143 when the seljuks of rum retook it after the battle of köse dağ in 1243 in which the mongols defeated the seljuks most of anatolia became part of the dominion of the mongols taking advantage of seljuk decline a semireligious cast of craftsmen and trade people named ahiler chose angora as their independent citystate in 1290 orhan the second bey of the ottoman empire captured the city in 1356 timur defeated bayezid i at the battle of ankara in 1402 and took the city but in 1403 angora was again under ottoman control the levant company maintained a factory in the town from 1639 to 1768 in the 19th century its population was estimated at 20000 to 60000 it was sacked by egyptians under ibrahim pasha in 1832 from 1867 to 1922 the city served as the capital of the angora vilayet which included most of ancient galatia prior to world war i the town had a british consulate and a population of around 28000 roughly 1 of whom were christian turkish republican capital following the ottoman defeat in world war i the ottoman capital constantinople modern istanbul and much of anatolia was occupied by the allies who planned to share these lands between armenia france greece italy and the united kingdom leaving for the turks the core piece of land in central anatolia in response the leader of the turkish nationalist movement mustafa kemal atatürk established the headquarters of his resistance movement in angora in 1920 after the turkish war of independence was won and the treaty of sèvres was superseded by the treaty of lausanne 1923 the turkish nationalists replaced the ottoman empire with the republic of turkey on 29 october 1923 a few days earlier angora had officially replaced constantinople as the new turkish capital city on 13 october 1923 and republican officials declared that the citys name is ankara after ankara became the capital of the newly founded republic of turkey new development divided the city into an old section called ulus and a new section called yenişehir ancient buildings reflecting roman byzantine and ottoman history and narrow winding streets mark the old section the new section now centered on kızılay square has the trappings of a more modern city wide streets hotels theaters shopping malls and highrises government offices and foreign embassies are also located in the new section ankara has experienced a phenomenal growth since it was made turkeys capital in 1923 when it was a small town of no importance in 1924 the year after the government had moved there ankara had about 35000 residents by 1927 there were 44553 residents and by 1950 the population had grown to 286781 after 1930 the city officially became known in western languages as ankara by the late 1930s the english name angora was no longer in popular use ankara continued to grow rapidly during the

the city grew in a planned and orderly pace however from the 1950s onward the city grew much faster than envisioned because unemployment and poverty forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city to seek a better standard of living as a result many illegal houses called gecekondu were built around the city causing the unplanned and uncontrolled urban landscape of ankara as not enough planned housing could be built fast enough although precariously built the vast majority of them have electricity running water and modern household amenities nevertheless many of these gecekondus have been replaced by huge public housing projects in the form of tower blocks such as elvankent eryaman and güzelkent and also as mass housing compounds for military and civil service accommodation although many gecekondus still remain they too are gradually being replaced by mass housing compounds as empty land plots in the city of ankara for new construction projects are becoming impossible to

party chp who won the mayoral election in 2019 ankara is politically a triple battleground between the ruling conservative ak party the opposition kemalist centerleft republican peoples party chp and the nationalist farright mhp the province of ankara is divided into 25 districts the chps key and almost only political stronghold in ankara lies within the central area of çankaya which is the citys most populous district while the chp has always gained between 60 and 70 of the vote in çankaya since 2002 political support elsewhere throughout ankara is minimal the high population within çankaya as well as yenimahalle to an extent has allowed the chp to take overall second place behind the ak party in both local and general elections with the mhp a close third despite the fact that the mhp is politically stronger than the chp in almost every other district overall the ak party enjoys the most support throughout the city the electorate of ankara thus tend to vote in favor of the political right far more so than the other main cities of istanbul and i̇zmir in retrospect the 201314 protests against the ak party government were particularly strong in ankara proving to be fatal on multiple occasions the city suffered from a series of terrorist attacks in 2015 and 2016 most notably on 10 october 2015 17 february 2016 13 march 2016 and 15 july 2016 melih gökçek was the metropolitan mayor

yavaş amid allegations of systematic electoral fraud with the supreme electoral council and courts rejecting his appeals yavaş declared his intention to take the irregularities to the european court of human rights although gökçek was inaugurated for a fifth term most election observers believe that yavaş was the winner of the election gökçek resigned on 28 october 2017 and was replaced by the

to a worldfamous domestic cat breed  the turkish angora called ankara kedisi ankara cat in turkish turkish angoras are one of the ancient naturally occurring cat breeds having originated in ankara and its surrounding region in central anatolia they mostly have a white silky medium to long length coat no undercoat and a fine bone structure there seems to be a connection between the angora cats and persians and the turkish angora is also a distant cousin of the turkish van although they are known for their shimmery white coat there are more than twenty varieties including black blue and reddish fur they come in tabby and tabbywhite along with smoke varieties and are in every color other than pointed lavender and cinnamon all of which would indicate breeding to an outcross eyes may be blue green or amber or even one blue and one amber or green the w gene which is responsible for the white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability and the presence of a blue eye can indicate that the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located however a great many blue and oddeyed white cats have normal hearing and even deaf cats lead a very normal life if kept indoors ears are pointed and large eyes are almond shaped and the head is massive with a two plane profile another characteristic is the tail which is often kept parallel to the back angora goat the angora goat ankara keçisi is a breed of domestic goat that originated in ankara and its surrounding region in central anatolia this breed was first mentioned in the time of moses roughly in 1500 bc the first angora goats were brought to europe by charles v holy roman emperor about 1554 but like later imports were not very successful angora goats were first introduced in the united states in 1849 by james p davis seven adult goats were a gift from sultan abdülmecid i in appreciation for his services and advice on the raising of cotton the fleece taken from an angora goat is called mohair a single goat produces between 5 of hair per year angoras are shorn twice a year unlike sheep which are shorn only once angoras have high nutritional requirements due to their rapid hair growth a poor quality diet will curtail mohair development the united states turkey and south africa are the top producers of mohair for a long period of time angora goats were bred for their white coat in 1998 the colored angora goat breeders association was set up to promote breeding of colored angoras today angora goats produce white black deep black to greys and silver red the color fades significantly as the goat gets older and brownish fiber angora goats were depicted on the reverse of the turkish 50 lira banknotes of 19381952 angora rabbit the angora rabbit ankara tavşanı is a variety of domestic rabbit bred for its long soft hair the angora is one of the oldest types of domestic rabbit originating in ankara and its surrounding region in central anatolia along with the angora cat and angora goat the rabbits were popular pets with french royalty in the mid18th century and spread to other parts of europe by the end of the century they first appeared in the united states in the early 20th century they are bred largely for their long angora wool which may be removed by shearing combing or plucking gently pulling loose wool angoras are bred mainly for their wool because it is silky and soft they have a humorous appearance as they oddly resemble a fur ball most are calm and docile but should be handled carefully grooming is necessary to prevent the fiber from matting and felting on the rabbit a condition called wool block is common in angora rabbits and should be treated quickly sometimes they are shorn in the summer as the long fur can cause the rabbits to overheat international relations

literary arabic known as modern standard arabic which is derived from classical arabic this distinction exists primarily among western linguists arabic speakers themselves generally do not distinguish between modern standard arabic and classical arabic but rather refer to both as ar العربية ٱلفصحى the eloquent arabic or simply ar الفصحى arabic is an official language of 26 states and one disputed territory the third most after english and french one of six official languages of the united nations and is the liturgical language of islam arabic is widely taught in schools and universities around the world and is used to varying degrees in workplaces governments and the media during the middle ages arabic was a major vehicle of culture especially in science mathematics and philosophy as a result many european languages have also borrowed many words from it arabic influence mainly in vocabulary is seen in european languagesmainly spanish and to a lesser extent portuguese catalan and sicilianowing to both the proximity of european and the longlasting arabic cultural and linguistic presence mainly in southern iberia during the alandalus era the maltese language is a semitic language developed from a dialect of arabic and written in the latin alphabet the balkan languages including greek and bulgarian have also acquired through contact with ottoman turkish a significant number of vocabulary of arabic origin arabic has influenced many other languages around the globe throughout its history especially languages of muslim cultures and countries that were conquered by muslims some of the most influenced languages are persian turkish hindustani hindi and urdu kashmiri kurdish bosnian kazakh bengali malay indonesian and malaysian maldivian pashto punjabi albanian armenian azerbaijani sicilian spanish greek bulgarian tagalog sindhi odia hebrew and hausa and some languages in parts of africa such as somali and swahili conversely arabic has borrowed words from other languages including aramaic as well as hebrew latin greek persian and to a lesser extent turkish english french and other semitic languages arabic is spoken by as many as 380 million speakers both native and nonnative in the arab world making it the fifth most spoken language in the world and the fourth most used language on the internet in terms of users it also serves as the liturgical language of more than 19 billion muslims in 2011 bloomberg businessweek ranked arabic the fourth most useful language for business after english standard mandarin chinese and french arabic is written with the arabic alphabet which is an abjad script and is written from right to left although the spoken varieties are sometimes written in ascii latin from left to right with no standardized orthography classification arabic is usually classified as a central semitic language linguists still differ as to the best classification of semitic language subgroups the semitic languages changed significantly between protosemitic and the emergence of central semitic languages particularly in grammar innovations of the central semitic languagesall maintained in arabicinclude there are several features which classical arabic the modern arabic varieties as well as the safaitic and hismaic inscriptions share which are unattested in any other central semitic language variety including the dadanitic and taymanitic languages of the northern hejaz these features are evidence of common descent from a hypothetical ancestor protoarabic the following features of protoarabic can be reconstructed with confidence on the other hand several arabic varieties are closer to other semitic languages and maintain features not found in classical arabic indicating that these varieties cannot have developed from classical arabic thus arabic vernaculars do not descend from classical arabic classical arabic is a sister language rather than their direct ancestor history old arabic arabia had a wide variety of semitic languages in antiquity the term arab was initially used to describe those living in the arabian peninsula as perceived by geographers from ancient greece in the southwest various central semitic languages both belonging to and outside the ancient south arabian family eg southern thamudic were spoken it is believed that the ancestors of the modern south arabian languages noncentral semitic languages were spoken in southern arabia at this time to the north in the oases of northern hejaz dadanitic and taymanitic held some prestige as inscriptional languages in najd and parts of western arabia a language known to scholars as thamudic c is attested in eastern arabia inscriptions in a script derived from asa attest to a language known as hasaitic on the northwestern frontier of arabia various languages known to scholars as thamudic b thamudic d safaitic and hismaic are attested the last two share important isoglosses with later forms of arabic leading scholars to theorize that safaitic and hismaic are early forms of arabic and that they should be considered old arabic linguists generally believe that old arabic a collection of related dialects that constitute the precursor of arabic first emerged during the iron age previously the earliest attestation of old arabic was thought to be a single 1st century ce inscription in sabaic script at qaryat alfaw in southern presentday saudi arabia however this inscription does not participate in several of the key innovations of the arabic language group such as the conversion of semitic mimation to nunation in the singular it is best reassessed as a separate language on the central semitic dialect continuum it was also thought that old arabic coexisted alongsideand then gradually displacedepigraphic ancient north arabian ana which was theorized to have been the regional tongue for many centuries ana despite its name was considered a very distinct language and mutually unintelligible from arabic scholars named its variant dialects after the towns where the inscriptions were discovered dadanitic taymanitic hismaic safaitic however most arguments for a single ana language or language family were based on the shape of the definite article a prefixed h it has been argued that the h is an archaism and not a shared innovation and thus unsuitable for language classification rendering the hypothesis of an ana language family untenable safaitic and hismaic previously considered ana should be considered old arabic due to the fact that they participate in the innovations common to all forms of arabic the earliest attestation of continuous arabic text in an ancestor of the modern arabic script are three lines of poetry by a man named garmallāhe found in en avdat israel and dated to around 125 ce this is followed by the namara inscription an epitaph of the lakhmid king imru alqays bar amro dating to 328 ce found at namaraa syria from the 4th to the 6th centuries the nabataean script evolved into the arabic script recognizable from the early islamic era there are inscriptions in an undotted 17letter arabic script dating to the 6th century ce found at four locations in syria zabad jebel usays harran umm eljimal the oldest surviving papyrus in arabic dates to 643 ce and it uses dots to produce the modern 28letter arabic alphabet the language of that papyrus and of the quran is referred to by linguists as quranic arabic as distinct from its codification soon thereafter into classical arabic classical arabic in late preislamic times a transdialectal and transcommunal variety of arabic emerged in the hejaz which continued living its parallel life after literary arabic had been institutionally standardized in the 2nd and 3rd century of the hijra most strongly in judeochristian texts keeping alive ancient features eliminated from the learned tradition classical arabic this variety and both its classicizing and lay iterations have been termed middle arabic in the past but they are thought to continue an old higazi register it is clear that the orthography of the quran was not developed for the standardized form of classical arabic rather it shows the attempt on the part of writers to record an archaic form of old higaziseptember 2022 in the late 6th century ad a relatively uniform intertribal poetic koine distinct from the spoken vernaculars developed based on the bedouin dialects of najd probably in connection with the court of alḥīra during the first islamic century the majority of arabic poets and arabicwriting persons spoke arabic as their mother tongue their texts although mainly preserved in far later manuscripts contain traces of nonstandardized classical arabic elements in morphology and syntaxseptember

conquests arabic gained vocabulary from middle persian and turkish in the early abbasid period many classical greek terms entered arabic through translations carried out at baghdads house of wisdom by the 8th century knowledge of classical arabic had become an essential prerequisite for rising into the higher classes throughout the islamic world both for muslims and nonmuslims for example maimonides the andalusi jewish philosopher authored works in judeoarabicarabic written in hebrew script development ibn jinni of mosul a pioneer in phonology wrote prolifically in the 10th century on

years prior the maghrebi lexicographer ibn manzur compiled lisān alʿarab لسان العرب tongue of arabs a major reference dictionary of arabic in 1290 neoarabic charles fergusons koine theory claims that the modern arabic dialects collectively descend from a single military koine that sprang up during the islamic conquests this view has been challenged in recent times ahmad aljallad proposes that there were at least two considerably distinct types of arabic on the eve of the conquests northern and central aljallad 2009 the modern dialects emerged from a new contact situation produced following the conquests instead of the emergence of a single or multiple koines the dialects contain several sedimentary layers of borrowed and areal features which they absorbed at different points in their linguistic histories according to veersteegh and bickerton colloquial arabic dialects arose from pidginized arabic formed from contact between arabs and conquered peoples pidginization and subsequent creolization among arabs and arabized peoples could explain relative morphological and phonological simplicity of vernacular arabic compared to classical and msa in around the 11th and 12th centuries in alandalus the zajal and muwashah poetry forms developed in the dialectical arabic of cordoba and the maghreb nahda the nahda was a cultural and especially literary renaissance of the 19th century in which writers sought to fuse arabic and european forms of expression according to james l gelvin nahda writers attempted to simplify the arabic language and script so that it might be accessible to a wider audience in the wake of the industrial revolution and european hegemony and colonialism pioneering arabic presses such as the amiri press established by muhammad ali 1819 dramatically changed the diffusion and consumption of arabic literature and publications rifaa altahtawi proposed the establishment of madrasat alalsun in 1836 and led a translation campaign that highlighted the need for a lexical injection in arabic to suit concepts of the industrial and postindustrial age such as sayyārah سيارة automobile or bākhirah باخرة steamship in response a number of arabic academies modeled after the académie française were established with the aim of developing standardized additions to the arabic lexicon to suit these transformations first in damascus 1919 then in cairo 1932 baghdad 1948 rabat 1960 amman 1977 academy of the arabic language in khartum 1993 and tunis 1993 they review language development monitor new words and approve the inclusion of new words into their published standard dictionaries they also publish old and historical arabic manuscriptsseptember 2022 in 1997 a bureau of arabization standardization was added to the educational cultural and scientific organization of the arab league these academies and organizations have worked toward the arabization of the sciences creating terms in arabic to describe new concepts toward the standardization of these new terms throughout the arabicspeaking world and toward the development of arabic as a world language this gave rise to what western scholars call modern standard arabic from the 1950s arabization became a postcolonial nationalist policy in countries such as tunisia algeria morocco and sudan classical modern standard and spoken arabic modern standard arabic msa largely follows the grammatical standards of classical arabic and uses much of the same vocabulary however it has discarded some grammatical constructions and vocabulary that no longer have any counterpart in the spoken varieties and has adopted certain new constructions and vocabulary from the spoken varieties much of the new vocabulary is used to denote concepts that have arisen in the industrial and postindustrial era especially in modern times due to its grounding in classical arabic modern standard arabic is removed over a millennium from everyday speech which is construed as a multitude of dialects of this language these dialects and modern standard arabic are described by some scholars as not mutually comprehensible the former are usually acquired in families while the latter is taught in formal education settings however there have been studies reporting some degree of comprehension of stories told in the standard variety among preschoolaged children the relation between modern standard arabic and these dialects is sometimes compared to that of classical latin and vulgar latin vernaculars which became romance languages in medieval and early modern europe msa is the variety used in most current printed arabic publications spoken by some of the arabic media across north africa and the middle east and understood by most educated arabic speakers literary arabic and standard arabic فصحى ar are less strictly defined terms that may refer to modern standard arabic or classical arabicseptember 2022 some of the differences between classical arabic ca and modern standard arabic msa are as followsseptember 2022 msa uses much classical vocabulary eg ar to go that is not present in the spoken varieties but deletes classical words that sound obsolete in msa in addition msa has borrowed or coined many terms for concepts that did not exist in quranic times and msa continues to evolve some words have been borrowed from other languagesnotice that transliteration mainly indicates spelling and not real pronunciation eg فلم ar film or ديمقراطية ar democracyseptember 2022 the current preference is to avoid direct borrowings preferring to either use loan translations eg فرع ar branch also used for the branch of a company or organization جناح ar wing is also used for the wing of an airplane building air force etc or to coin new words using forms within existing roots استماتة ar apoptosis using the root موت mwt death put into the xth form or جامعة ar university based on جمع ar to gather unite جمهورية ar republic based on جمهور ar multitude an earlier tendency was to redefine an older word although this has fallen into disuse eg هاتف ar telephone  invisible caller in sufism جريدة ar newspaper  palmleaf stalkseptember 2022 colloquial or dialectal arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties which constitute the everyday spoken language colloquial arabic has many regional variants geographically distant varieties usually differ enough to be mutually unintelligible and some linguists consider them distinct languages however research indicates a high degree of mutual intelligibility between closely related arabic variants for native speakers listening to words sentences and texts and between more distantly related dialects in interactional situationsthe varieties are typically unwritten they are often used in informal spoken media such as soap operas and talk shows as well as occasionally in certain forms of written media such as poetry and printed advertising hassaniya arabic maltese and cypriot arabic are only varieties of modern arabic to have acquired official recognition hassaniya is official in mali and recognized as a minority language in morocco while the senegalese government adopted the latin script to write it maltese is official in predominantly catholic malta and written with the latin script linguists agree that it is a variety of spoken arabic descended from siculoarabic though it has experienced extensive changes as a result of sustained and intensive contact with italoromance varieties and more recently also with english due to a mix of social cultural historical political and indeed linguistic factors many maltese people today consider their language semitic but not a type of arabic cypriot arabic is recognized as a minority language in cyprus status and usage diglossia the sociolinguistic situation of arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossia which is the normal use of two separate varieties of the same language usually in different social situations tawleed is the process of giving a new shade of meaning to an old classical word for example alhatif lexicographically means the one whose sound is heard but whose person remains unseen now the term alhatif is used for a telephone therefore the process of tawleed can express the needs of modern civilization in a manner that would appear to be originally arabic in the case of arabic educated arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their schooltaught standard arabic as well as their native dialects which depending on the region may be mutually unintelligible some of these dialects can be considered to constitute separate languages which may have subdialects of their own when educated arabs of different dialects engage in conversation for example a moroccan speaking with a lebanese many speakers codeswitch back and forth between the dialectal and standard varieties of the language sometimes even within the same sentence the issue of whether arabic is one language or many languages is politically charged in the same way it is for the varieties of chinese hindi and urdu serbian and croatian scots and english etc in contrast to speakers of hindi and urdu who claim they cannot understand each other even when they can speakers of the varieties of arabic will claim they can all understand each other even when they cannot while there is a minimum level of comprehension between all arabic dialects this level can increase or decrease based on geographic proximity for example levantine and gulf speakers understand each other much better than they do speakers from the maghreb the issue of diglossia between spoken and written language is a significant complicating factor a single written form significantly different from any of the spoken varieties learned natively unites a number of sometimes divergent spoken forms for political reasons arabs mostly assert that they all speak a single language despite significant issues of mutual incomprehensibility among differing spoken versions from a linguistic standpoint it is often said that the various spoken varieties of arabic differ among each other collectively about as much as the romance languages this is an apt comparison in a number of ways the period of divergence from a single spoken form is similarperhaps 1500 years for arabic 2000 years for the romance languages also while it is comprehensible to people from the maghreb a linguistically innovative variety such as moroccan arabic is essentially incomprehensible to arabs from the mashriq much as french is incomprehensible to spanish or italian speakers but relatively easily learned by them this suggests that the spoken varieties may linguistically be considered separate languagesseptember 2022 status in the arab world visàvis other languages with the sole example of medieval linguist abu hayyan algharnati  who while a scholar of the arabic language was not ethnically arab  medieval scholars of the arabic language made no efforts at studying comparative linguistics considering all other languages inferior in modern times the educated upper classes in the arab world have taken a nearly opposite view yasir suleiman wrote in 2011 that studying and knowing english or french in most of the middle east and north africa have become a badge of sophistication and modernity and  feigning or asserting weakness or lack of facility in arabic is sometimes paraded as a sign of status class and perversely even education through a mélange of codeswitching practises as a foreign language arabic has been taught worldwide in many elementary and secondary schools especially muslim schools universities around the world have classes that teach arabic as part of their foreign languages middle eastern studies and religious studies courses arabic language schools exist to assist students to learn arabic outside the academic world there are many arabic language schools in the arab world and other muslim countries because the quran is written in arabic and all islamic terms are in arabic millions of muslims both arab and nonarab study the language software and books with tapes are an important part of arabic learning as many of arabic learners may live in places where there are no academic or arabic language school classes available radio series of arabic language classes are also provided from some radio stations a number of websites on the internet provide online classes for all levels as a means of distance education most teach modern standard arabic but some teach regional varieties from numerous countries vocabulary lexicography premodern arabic lexicography the tradition of arabic lexicography extended for about a millennium before the modern period early lexicographers لغويون lughawiyyūn sought to explain words in the quran that were unfamiliar or had a particular contextual meaning and to identify words of nonarabic origin that appear in the quran they gathered shawāhid شواهد instances of attested usage from poetry and the speech of the arabsparticularly the bedouin ʾaʿrāb bedouins أعراب who were perceived to speak the purest most eloquent form of arabicinitiating a process of jamʿulluɣah جمع اللغة compiling the language which took place over the 8th and early 9th centurieskitāb alayn 8th century attributed to alkhalil ibn ahmad alfarahidi is considered the first lexicon to include all arabic roots it sought to exhaust all possible root permutationslater called taqālīb تقاليبcalling those that are actually used mustaʿmal مستعمل and those that are not used muhmal مهمل lisān alʿarab 1290 by ibn manzur gives 9273 roots while tāj alʿarūs 1774 by murtada azzabidi gives 11978 roots this lexicographic tradition was traditionalist and corrective in natureholding that linguistic correctness and eloquence derive from qurʾānic usage jahili poetry and bedouin speechpositioning itself against laḥnulʿāmmah لحن العامة the solecism it viewed as defective western lexicography of arabic in the second half of the 19th century the british arabist edward william lane working with the egyptian scholar ibrāhīm abd alghaffār addasūqī compiled the arabicenglish lexicon by translating material from earlier arabic lexica into english the german arabist hans wehr with contributions from hedwig klein compiled the arabisches wörterbuch für die schriftsprache der gegenwart 1952 later translated into english as a dictionary of modern written arabic 1961 based on established usage especially in literature modern arabic lexicography the academy of the arabic language in cairo sought to publish a historical dictionary of arabic in the vein of the oxford english dictionary tracing the changes of meanings and uses of arabic words over time a first volume of almuʿjam alkabīr was published in 1956 under the leadership of taha hussein the project is not yet complete its 15th volume covering the letter ṣād was published in 2022 loanwords the most important sources of borrowings into preislamic arabic are from the related semitic languages aramaic which used to be the principal international language of communication throughout the ancient near and middle east and ethiopic many cultural religious and political terms have entered arabic from iranian languages notably middle persian parthian and classical persian and hellenistic greek kīmiyāʼ has as origin the greek khymia meaning in that language the melting of metals see roger dachez histoire de la médecine de lantiquité au xxe siècle

languages on arabic is found in lucas  manfredi 2020 influence of arabic on other languages the influence of arabic has been most important in islamic countries because it is the language of the islamic sacred book the quran arabic is also an important source of vocabulary for languages such as amharic azerbaijani baluchi bengali berber bosnian chaldean chechen chittagonian croatian dagestani dhivehi english german gujarati hausa hindi kazakh kurdish kutchi kyrgyz malay malaysian and indonesian pashto persian punjabi rohingya romance languages french catalan italian portuguese sicilian spanish etc saraiki sindhi somali sylheti swahili tagalog tigrinya turkish turkmen urdu uyghur uzbek visayan and wolof as well as other languages in countries where these languages are spoken modern hebrew has been also influenced by arabic especially during the process of revival as msa was used as a source for modern hebrew vocabulary and roots english has many arabic loanwords some directly but most via other mediterranean languages examples of such words include admiral adobe alchemy alcohol algebra algorithm alkaline almanac amber arsenal assassin candy carat cipher coffee cotton ghoul hazard jar kismet lemon loofah magazine mattress sherbet sofa sumac tariff and zenith other languages such as maltese and kinubi derive ultimately from arabic rather than merely borrowing vocabulary or grammatical rules terms borrowed range from religious terminology like berber taẓallit prayer from salat صلاة ar academic terms like uyghur mentiq logic and economic items like english coffee to placeholders like spanish fulano soandso everyday terms like hindustani lekin but or spanish taza and french tasse meaning cup and expressions like catalan a betzef galore in quantity most berber varieties such as kabyle along with swahili borrow some numbers from arabic most islamic religious terms are direct borrowings from arabic such as صلاة ṣalāh prayer and إمام imām prayer leaderseptember 2022 in languages not directly in contact with the arab world arabic loanwords are often transferred indirectly via other languages rather than being transferred directly from arabic for example most arabic loanwords in hindustani and turkish entered through persian older arabic loanwords in hausa were borrowed from kanuri most arabic loanwords in yoruba entered through hausaseptember 2021 arabic words made their way into several west african languages as islam spread across the sahara variants of arabic words such as كتاب kitāb book have spread to the languages of african groups who had no direct contact with arab traders since throughout the islamic world arabic occupied a position similar to that of latin in europe many of the arabic concepts in the fields of science philosophy commerce etc were coined from arabic roots by nonnative arabic speakers notably by aramaic and persian translators and then found their way into other languages this process of using arabic roots especially in kurdish and persian to translate foreign concepts continued through to the 18th and 19th centuries when swaths of arabinhabited lands were under ottoman ruleseptember 2022 spoken varieties filearabic varieties map2023svgthumbcenterupright3geographical distribution of the varieties of arabic per ethnologue and other sources other changes may also have happened classical arabic pronunciation is not thoroughly recorded and different reconstructions of the sound system of protosemitic propose different phonetic values one example is the emphatic consonants which are pharyngealized in modern pronunciations but may have been velarized in the eighth century and glottalized in protosemitic reduction of j and w between vowels occurs in a number of circumstances and is responsible for much of the complexity of thirdweak defective verbs early akkadian transcriptions of arabic names show that this reduction had not yet occurred as of the early part of the 1st millennium bcseptember 2022 the classical arabic language as recorded was a poetic koine that reflected a consciously archaizing dialect chosen based on the tribes of the western part of the arabian peninsula who spoke the most conservative variants of arabic even at the time of muhammed and before other dialects existed with many more changes including the loss of most glottal stops the loss of case endings the reduction of the diphthongs aj and aw into monophthongs eː oː etc most of these changes are present in most or all modern varieties of arabicseptember 2022 an interesting feature of the writing system of the quran and hence of classical arabic is that it contains certain features of muhammads native dialect of mecca corrected through diacritics into the forms of standard classical arabic among these features visible under the corrections are the loss of the glottal stop and a differing development of the reduction of certain final sequences containing j evidently the final awa became aː as in the classical language but final aja became a different sound possibly eː rather than again aː in the classical language this is the apparent source of the alif maqṣūrah restricted alif where a final aja is reconstructed a letter that would normally indicate j or some similar highvowel sound but is taken in this context to be a logical variant of alif and represent the sound aːseptember 2022 literary arabic the colloquial spoken dialects of arabic are learned at home and constitute the native languages of arabic speakers formal modern standard arabic is learned at school although many speakers have a nativelike command of the language it is technically not the native language of any speakers both varieties can be both written and spoken although the colloquial varieties are rarely written down and the formal variety is spoken mostly in formal circumstances eg in radio and tv broadcasts formal lectures parliamentary discussions and to some extent between speakers of different colloquial dialects even when the literary language is spoken it is normally only spoken in its pure form when reading a prepared text out loud and communicating between speakers of different colloquial dialects when speaking extemporaneously ie making up the language on the spot as in a normal discussion among people speakers tend to deviate somewhat from the strict literary language in the direction of the colloquial varieties there is a continuous range of inbetween spoken varieties from nearly pure modern standard arabic msa to a form that still uses msa grammar and vocabulary but with significant colloquial influence to a form of the colloquial language that imports a number of words and grammatical constructions in msa to a form that is close to pure colloquial but with the rough edges the most noticeably vulgar or nonclassical aspects smoothed out to pure colloquial the particular variant or register used depends on the social class and education level of the speakers involved and the level of formality of the speech situation often it will vary within a single encounter eg moving from nearly pure msa to a more mixed language in the process of a radio interview as the interviewee becomes more comfortable with the interviewer this type of variation is characteristic of the diglossia that exists throughout the arabicspeaking worldseptember 2022 although modern standard arabic msa is a unitary language its pronunciation varies somewhat from country to country and from region to region within a country the variation in individual accents of msa speakers tends to mirror corresponding variations in the colloquial speech of the speakers in question but with the distinguishing characteristics moderated somewhat it is important in descriptions of arabic phonology to distinguish between pronunciation of a given colloquial spoken dialect and the pronunciation of msa by these same speakers although they are related they are not the same for example the phoneme that derives from classical arabic ɟ has many different pronunciations in the modern spoken varieties eg  ʒ  j  ɡʲ  ɡ including the proposed original ɟ speakers whose native variety has either dʒ or ʒ will use the same pronunciation when speaking msa even speakers from cairo whose native egyptian arabic has ɡ normally use ɡ when speaking msa the j of persian gulf speakers is the only variant pronunciation which is not found in msa dʒʒ is used instead but may use j in msa for comfortable pronunciation another reason of different pronunciations is influence of colloquial dialects the differentiation of pronunciation of colloquial dialects is the influence from other languages previously spoken and some still presently spoken in the regions such as coptic in egypt berber punic or phoenician in north africa himyaritic modern south arabian and old south arabian in yemen and oman and aramaic and canaanite languages including phoenician in the levant and mesopotamiaseptember 2022 another example many colloquial varieties are known for a type of vowel harmony in which the presence of an emphatic consonant triggers backed allophones of nearby vowels especially of the low vowels aː which are backed to ɑ in these circumstances and very often fronted to æ in all other circumstances in many spoken varieties the backed or emphatic vowel allophones spread a fair distance in both directions from the triggering consonant in some varieties most notably egyptian arabic the emphatic allophones spread throughout the entire word usually including prefixes and suffixes even at a distance of several syllables from the triggering consonant speakers of colloquial varieties with this vowel harmony tend to introduce it into their msa pronunciation as well but usually with a lesser degree of spreading than in the colloquial varieties for example speakers of colloquial varieties with extremely longdistance harmony may allow a moderate but not extreme amount of spreading of the harmonic allophones in their msa speech while speakers of colloquial varieties with moderatedistance harmony may only harmonize immediately adjacent vowels in msaseptember 2022 vowels modern standard arabic has six pure vowels while most modern dialects have eight pure vowels which include the long vowels eː oː with short a i u and corresponding long vowels aː iː uː there are also two diphthongs aj and awseptember 2023 the pronunciation of the vowels differs from speaker to speaker in a way that tends to reflect the pronunciation of the corresponding colloquial variety nonetheless there are some common trends most noticeable is the differing pronunciation of a and aː which tend towards fronted æ a or ɛ in most situations but a back ɑ in the neighborhood of emphatic consonants some accents and dialects such as those of the hejaz region have an open a or a central ä in all situations the vowel a varies towards ə too listen to the final vowel in the recording of ar at the beginning of this article for example the point is arabic has only three short vowel phonemes so those phonemes can have a very wide range of allophones the vowels u and ɪ are often affected somewhat in emphatic neighborhoods as well with generally more back or centralized allophones but the differences are less great than for the low vowels the pronunciation of short u and i tends towards ʊo and ieɨ respectively in many dialectsseptember 2022 the definitions of both emphatic and neighborhood vary in ways that reflect to some extent corresponding variations in the spoken dialects generally the consonants triggering emphatic allophones are the pharyngealized consonants tˤ dˤ sˤ ðˤ q and r if not followed immediately by iː frequently the velar fricatives x ɣ trigger emphatic allophones occasionally also the pharyngeal consonants ʕ ħ the former more than the latter many dialects have multiple emphatic allophones of each vowel depending on the particular nearby consonants in most msa accents emphatic coloring of vowels is limited to vowels immediately adjacent to a triggering consonant although in some it spreads a bit farther eg وقت ar wɑqt time وطن ar wɑtˤɑn homeland وسط المدينة ar æl mæˈdiːnæ downtown also æl mæˈdiːnæ or similarseptember 2022 in a nonemphatic environment the vowel a in the diphthong aj is pronounced æj or ɛj hence سيف ar  sæjf  sɛjf sword but صيف ar sˤɑjf summer however in accents with no emphatic allophones of a eg in the hejaz the pronunciation aj or äj occurs in all situationsseptember 2022 consonants the phoneme dʒ is represented by the arabic letter ar ج and has many standard pronunciations dʒ is characteristic of north algeria iraq and most of the arabian peninsula but with an allophonic ʒ in some positions ʒ occurs in most of the levant and most of north africa and ɡ is standard in egypt coastal yemen as well as eastern and coastal western oman generally this corresponds with the pronunciation in the colloquial dialects in sudan and yemen as well as in some sudanese and yemeni varieties it may be either ɡʲ or ɟ representing the original pronunciation of classical arabic foreign words containing ɡ may be transcribed with ج غ ك ق گ ݣ or ڨ depending on the regional practice in northern egypt where the arabic letter ar ج is normally pronounced ɡ a separate phoneme ʒ which may be transcribed with چ occurs in a small number of mostly nonarabic loanwords eg ʒakitta jacketseptember 2022 x and ɣ خ غ are velar postvelar or uvular in many varieties ħ ʕ ح ع are epiglottal ʢ in west asiaseptember 2022 l is pronounced as velarized ɫ in الله ʔallaːh the name of god qe allah when the word follows a ā u or ū after i or ī it is unvelarized بسم الله bismillāh bismillaːh the emphatic consonant dˤ was actually pronounced ɮˤ or possibly dɮˤeither way a highly unusual sound the medieval arabs actually termed their language ar the language of the ḍād the name of the letter used for this sound since they thought the sound was unique to their language in fact it also exists in a few other minority semitic languages eg mehri arabic has consonants traditionally termed emphatic tˤ dˤ sˤ ðˤ ط ض ص ظ which exhibit simultaneous pharyngealization dˤ sˤ ðˤ as well as varying degrees of velarization dˠ sˠ ðˠ depending on the region so they may be written with the velarized or pharyngealized diacritic  as t d s ð this simultaneous articulation is described as retracted tongue root by phonologists in some transcription systems emphasis is shown by capitalizing the letter for example dˤ is written d in others the letter is underlined or has a dot below it for example ar vowels and consonants can be phonologically short or long long geminate consonants are normally written doubled in latin transcription ie bb dd etc reflecting the presence of the arabic diacritic mark ar which indicates doubled consonants in actual pronunciation doubled consonants are held twice as long as short consonants this consonant lengthening is phonemically contrastive قبل ar he accepted vs قبل ar he kissedseptember 2022 syllable structure arabic has two kinds of syllables open syllables cv and cvvand closed syllables cvc cvvc and cvcc the syllable types with two morae units of time ie cvc and cvv are termed heavy syllables while those with three morae ie cvvc and cvcc are superheavy syllables superheavy syllables in classical arabic occur in only two places at the end of the sentence due to pausal pronunciation and in words such as حار ar hot مادة ar stuff substance تحاجوا ar they disputed with each other where a long ar occurs before two identical consonants a former short vowel between the consonants has been lost in less formal pronunciations of modern standard arabic superheavy syllables are common at the end of words or before clitic suffixes such as ar us our due to the deletion of final short vowelsseptember 2022 in surface pronunciation every vowel must be preceded by a consonant which may include the glottal stop ʔ there are no cases of hiatus within a word where two vowels occur next to each other without an intervening consonant some words do have an underlying vowel at the beginning such as the definite article al or words such as اشترا ar he bought اجتماع ar meeting when actually pronounced one of three things happens stress word stress is not phonemically contrastive in standard arabic it bears a strong relationship to vowel length the basic rules for modern standard arabic are these rules may result in differently stressed syllables when final case endings are pronounced vs the normal situation where they are not pronounced as in the above example of ar library in full pronunciation but ar library in short pronunciationseptember 2022 the restriction on final long vowels does not apply to the spoken dialects where original final long vowels have been shortened and secondary final long vowels have arisen from loss of original final huhiseptember 2022 some dialects have different stress rules in the egyptian arabic dialect a heavy syllable may not carry stress more than two syllables from the end of a word hence ar school ar cairo this also affects the way that modern standard arabic is pronounced in egypt in the arabic of sanaa stress is often retracted ar two houses ar their table ar desks ar sometimes ar their school in this dialect only syllables with long vowels or diphthongs are considered heavy in a twosyllable word the final syllable can be stressed only if the preceding syllable is light and in longer words the final syllable cannot be stressedseptember 2022 colloquial varieties vowels as mentioned above many spoken dialects have a process of emphasis spreading where the emphasis pharyngealization of emphatic consonants spreads forward and back through adjacent syllables pharyngealizing all nearby consonants and triggering the back allophone ɑ in all nearby low vowels the extent of emphasis spreading varies for example in moroccan arabic it spreads as far as the first full vowel ie sound derived from a long vowel or diphthong on either side in many levantine dialects it spreads indefinitely but is blocked by any j or ʃ while in egyptian arabic it usually spreads throughout the entire word including prefixes and suffixes in moroccan arabic i u also have emphatic allophones eɛ and oɔ respectivelyseptember 2022 unstressed short vowels especially i u are deleted in many contexts many sporadic examples of short vowel change have occurred especially ai and interchange iu most levantine dialects merge short i u into ə in most contexts all except directly before a single final consonant in moroccan arabic on the other hand short u triggers labialization of nearby consonants especially velar consonants and uvular consonants and then short a i u all merge into ə which is deleted in many contexts the labialization plus ə is sometimes interpreted as an underlying phoneme ŭ this essentially causes the wholesale loss of the shortlong vowel distinction with the original long vowels aː iː uː remaining as halflong iˑ uˑ phonemically a i u which are used to represent both short and long vowels in borrowings from literary arabicseptember 2022 most spoken dialects have monophthongized original aj aw to eː oː in most circumstances including adjacent to emphatic consonants while keeping them as the original diphthongs in others eg موعد mawʕid in most of the moroccan algerian and tunisian except sahel and southeastern arabic dialects they have subsequently merged into original iː uːseptember 2022 consonants in most dialects there may be more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above for example g is considered a native phoneme in most arabic dialects except in levantine dialects like syrian or lebanese where ج is pronounced ʒ and ق is pronounced ʔ dʒ or ʒ ج is considered a native phoneme in most dialects except in egyptian and a number of yemeni and omani dialects where ج is pronounced g zˤ or ðˤ and dˤ are distinguished in the dialects of egypt sudan the levant and the hejaz they have merged as ðˤ in most dialects of the arabian peninsula iraq and tunisia and have merged as dˤ in morocco and algeria the usage of nonnative p پ and v ڤ depends on the usage of each speaker but they might be more prevalent in some dialects than others the iraqi and gulf arabic has the sound tʃ and writes it and ɡ with the persian letters چ and گ as in گوجة ar plum چمة ar truffle early in the expansion of arabic the separate emphatic phonemes ɮˤ and ðˤ coalesced into a single phoneme ðˤ many dialects such as egyptian levantine and much of the maghreb subsequently lost interdental fricatives converting ð ðˤ into d dˤ most dialects borrow learned words from the standard language using the same pronunciation as for inherited words some dialects without interdental fricatives particularly in egypt and the levant render original ð ðˤ dˤ in borrowed words as z zˤ dˤ another key distinguishing mark of arabic dialects is how they render the original velar and uvular plosives q dʒ protosemitic ɡ and k pharyngealization of the emphatic consonants tends to weaken in many of the spoken varieties and to spread from emphatic consonants to nearby sounds the emphatic allophone ɑ automatically triggers pharyngealization of adjacent sounds in many dialects as a result it may be difficult or impossible to determine whether a given coronal consonant is phonemically emphatic or not especially in dialects with longdistance emphasis spreading a notable exception is the sounds t vs tˤ in moroccan arabic because the former is pronounced as an affricate ts but the latter is not grammar arabic grammarthe grammar of arabic has similarities with the grammar of other semitic languages some of the typical differences between standard arabic فصحى and vernacular varieties are a loss of morphological markings of grammatical case changes in word order a shift toward more analytic morphosyntax loss of grammatical mood and loss of the inflected passive voice literary arabic as in other semitic languages arabic has a complex and unusual morphology ie method of constructing words from a basic root arabic has a nonconcatenative rootandpattern morphology a root consists of a set of bare consonants usually three which are fitted into a discontinuous pattern to form words for example the word for i wrote is constructed by combining the root ar write with the pattern ar i xed to form ar i wrote other verbs meaning i xed will typically have the same pattern but with different consonants eg ar i read ar i ate ar i went although other patterns are possible eg ar i drank ar i said ar i spoke where the subpattern used to signal the past tense may change but the suffix ar is always used from a single root ar numerous words can be formed by applying different patterns nouns and adjectives nouns in literary arabic have three grammatical cases nominative accusative and genitive used when the noun is governed by a preposition three numbers singular dual and plural two genders masculine and feminine and three states indefinite definite and construct the cases of singular nouns other than those that end in long ā are indicated by suffixed short vowels u for nominative a for accusative i for genitive the feminine singular is often marked by ـة at which is pronounced as ah before a pause plural is indicated either through endings the sound plural or internal modification the broken plural definite nouns include all proper nouns all nouns in construct state and all nouns which are prefixed by the definite article الـ al indefinite singular nouns other than those that end in long ā add a final n to the casemarking vowels giving un an or in which is also referred to as nunation or tanwīn adjectives in literary arabic are marked for case number gender and state as for nouns the plural of all nonhuman nouns is always combined with a singular feminine adjective which takes the ـة at suffix pronouns in literary arabic are marked for person number and gender there are two varieties independent pronouns and enclitics enclitic pronouns are attached to the end of a verb noun or preposition and indicate verbal and prepositional objects or possession of nouns the firstperson singular pronoun has a different enclitic form used for verbs ـني nī and for nouns or prepositions ـي ī after consonants ـي ya after vowels nouns verbs pronouns and adjectives agree with each other in all respects nonhuman plural nouns are grammatically considered to be feminine singular a verb in a verbinitial sentence is marked as singular regardless of its semantic number when the subject of the verb is explicitly mentioned as a noun numerals between three and ten show chiasmic agreement in that grammatically masculine numerals have feminine marking and vice versa verbs verbs in literary arabic are marked for person first second or third gender and number they are conjugated in two major paradigms past and nonpast two voices active and passive and six moods indicative imperative subjunctive jussive shorter energetic and longer energetic the fifth and sixth moods the energetics exist only in classical arabic but not in msa there are two participles active and passive and a verbal noun but no infinitive the past and nonpast paradigms are sometimes termed perfective and imperfective indicating the fact that they actually represent a combination of tense and aspect the moods other than the indicative occur only in the nonpast and the future tense is signaled by prefixing سـ ar or سوف ar onto the nonpast the past and nonpast differ in the form of the stem eg past كتبـ ar vs nonpast ـكتبـ ar and use completely different sets of affixes for indicating person number and gender in the past the person number and gender are fused into a single suffixal morpheme while in the nonpast a combination of prefixes primarily encoding person and suffixes primarily encoding gender and number are used the passive voice uses the same personnumbergender affixes but changes the vowels of the stem the following shows a paradigm of a regular arabic verb كتب ar to write in modern standard the energetic mood in either long or short form which have the same meaning is almost never used derivation like other semitic languages and unlike most other languages arabic makes much more use of nonconcatenative morphology applying many templates applied roots to derive words than adding prefixes or suffixes to words for verbs a given root can occur in many different derived verb stems of which there are about fifteen each with one or more characteristic meanings and each with its own templates for the past and nonpast stems active and passive participles and verbal noun these are referred to by western scholars as form i form ii and so on through form xv although forms xi to xv are rare these stems encode grammatical functions such as the causative intensive and reflexive stems sharing the same root consonants represent separate verbs albeit often semantically related and each is the basis for its own conjugational paradigm as a result these derived stems are part of the system of derivational morphology not part of the inflectional system examples of the different verbs formed from the root كتب ar write using حمر ar red for form ix which is limited to colors and physical defects form ii is sometimes used to create transitive denominative verbs verbs built from nouns form v is the equivalent used for intransitive denominatives the associated participles and verbal nouns of a verb are the primary means of forming new lexical nouns in arabic this is similar to the process by which for example the english gerund meeting similar to a verbal noun has turned into a noun referring to a particular type of social often workrelated event where people gather together to have a discussion another lexicalized verbal noun another fairly common means of forming nouns is through one of a limited number of patterns that can be applied directly to roots such as the nouns of location in ma eg ar desk office  ar write ar kitchen  ar cook the only three genuine suffixes are as follows colloquial varieties the spoken dialects have lost the case distinctions and make only limited use of the dual it occurs only on nouns and its use is no longer required in all circumstances they have lost the mood distinctions other than imperative but many have since gained new moods through the use of prefixes most often bi for indicative vs unmarked subjunctive they have also mostly lost the indefinite nunation and the internal passive the following is an example of a regular verb paradigm in egyptian arabic writing system writing system the arabic alphabet derives from the aramaic through nabatean to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of coptic or cyrillic scripts to greek script traditionally there were several differences between the western north african and middle eastern versions of the alphabetin particular the faʼ had a dot underneath and qaf a single dot above in the maghreb and the order of the letters was slightly different at least when they were used as numerals however the old maghrebi variant has been abandoned except for calligraphic purposes in the maghreb itself and remains in use mainly in the quranic schools zaouias of west africa arabic like all other semitic languages except for the latinwritten maltese and the languages with the geez script is written from right to left there are several styles of scripts such as thuluth muhaqqaq tawqi rayhan and notably naskh which is used in print and by computers and ruqʻah which is commonly used for correspondence originally arabic was made up of only rasm without diacritical marks later diacritical points which in arabic are referred to as nuqaṯ were added which allowed readers to distinguish between letters such as b t th n and y finally signs known as tashkil were used for short vowels known as harakat and other uses such as final postnasalized or long vowels calligraphy after khalil ibn ahmad al farahidi finally fixed the arabic script around 786 many styles were developed both for the writing down of the quran and other books and for inscriptions on monuments as decoration arabic calligraphy has not fallen out of use as calligraphy has in the western world and is still considered by arabs as a major art form calligraphers are held in great esteem being cursive by nature unlike the latin script arabic script is used to write down a verse of the quran a hadith or a proverb the composition is often abstract but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal one of the current masters of the genre is hassan massoudyseptember 2022 in modern times the intrinsically calligraphic nature of the written arabic form is haunted by the thought that a typographic approach to the language necessary for digitized unification will not always accurately maintain meanings conveyed through calligraphy romanization there are a number of different standards for the romanization of arabic ie methods of accurately and efficiently representing arabic with the latin script there are various conflicting motivations involved which leads to multiple systems some are interested in transliteration ie representing the spelling of arabic while others focus on transcription ie representing the pronunciation of arabic they differ in that for example the same letter ي is used to represent both a consonant as in you or yet and a vowel as in me or eat some systems eg for scholarly use are intended to accurately and unambiguously represent the phonemes of arabic generally making the phonetics more explicit than the original word in the arabic script these systems are heavily reliant on diacritical marks such as š for the sound equivalently written sh in english other systems eg the baháí orthography are intended to help readers who are neither arabic speakers nor linguists with intuitive pronunciation of arabic names and phrasesnovember 2019 these less scientific systems tend to avoid diacritics and use digraphs like sh and kh these are usually simpler to read but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems and may lead to ambiguities eg whether to interpret sh as a single sound as in gash or a combination of two sounds as in gashouse the alalc romanization solves this problem by separating the two sounds with a prime symbol    eg ashal easier during the last few decades and especially since the 1990s westerninvented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the arab world such as personal computers the world wide web email bulletin board systems irc instant messaging and mobile phone text messaging most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the latin script only and some of them still do not have the arabic script as an optional feature as a result arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the arabic text using the latin script to handle those arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the latin script numerals and other characters were appropriated for example the numeral 3 may be used to represent the arabic letter ع there is no universal name for this type of transliteration but some have named it arabic chat alphabet or im arabic other systems of transliteration exist such as using dots or capitalization to represent the emphatic counterparts of certain consonants for instance using capitalization the letter د may be represented by d its emphatic counterpart ض may be written as d numerals in most of presentday north africa the western arabic numerals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 are used however in egypt and arabicspeaking countries to the east of it the eastern arabic numerals ٠  ١  ٢  ٣  ٤  ٥  ٦  ٧  ٨  ٩ are in use when representing a number in arabic the lowestvalued position is placed on the right so the order of positions is the same as in lefttoright scripts sequences of digits such as telephone numbers are read from left to right but numbers are spoken in the traditional arabic fashion with units and tens reversed from the modern english usage for example 24 is said four and twenty just like in the german language vierundzwanzig and classical hebrew and 1975 is said a thousand and ninehundred and five and seventy or more eloquently a thousand and ninehundred five seventy arabic alphabet and nationalism there have been many instances of national movements to convert arabic script into latin script or to romanize the language currently the only arabic variety to use latin script is maltese lebanon the beirut newspaper la syrie pushed for the change from arabic script to latin letters in 1922 the major head of this movement was louis massignon a french orientalist who brought his concern before the arabic language academy in damascus in 1928 massignons attempt at romanization failed as the academy and population viewed the proposal as an attempt from the western world to take over their country said afghani a member of the academy mentioned that the movement to romanize the script was a zionist plan to dominate lebanon said akl created a latinbased alphabet for lebanese and used it in a newspaper he founded lebnaan as well as in some books he wrote egypt after the period of colonialism in egypt egyptians were looking for a way to reclaim and reemphasize egyptian culture as a result some egyptians pushed for an egyptianization of the arabic language in which the formal arabic and the colloquial arabic would be combined into one language and the latin alphabet would be used there was also the idea of finding a way to use hieroglyphics instead of the latin alphabet but this was seen as too complicated to use a scholar salama musa agreed with the idea of applying a latin alphabet to arabic as he believed that would allow egypt to have a closer relationship with the west he also believed that latin script was key to the success of egypt as it would allow for more advances in science and technology this change in alphabet he believed would solve the problems inherent with arabic such as a lack of written vowels and difficulties writing foreign words that made it difficult for nonnative speakers to learn ahmad lutfi as sayid and muhammad azmi two egyptian intellectuals agreed with musa and supported the push for romanization the idea that romanization was necessary for modernization and growth in egypt continued with abd alaziz fahmi in 1944 he was the chairman for the writing and grammar committee for the arabic language academy of cairo this effort failed as the egyptian people felt a strong cultural tie to the arabic alphabet in particular the older egyptian generations believed that the arabic alphabet had strong connections to arab values and history due to the long history of the arabic alphabet shrivtiel 189 in muslim

lamb without a spot  hitchcock said he could not remember ever having had a playmate one of his favourite stories for interviewers was about his father sending him to the local police station with a note when he was five the policeman looked at the note and locked him in a cell for a few minutes saying this is what we do to naughty boys the experience left him with a lifelong phobia of law

lists his year of birth as 1900 rather than 1899 biographer donald spoto says he was deliberately enrolled as a tenyearold because he was a year behind with his schooling while biographer gene adair

an overwhelming majority of his films include rail or tram scenes in particular the lady vanishes strangers on a train and number seventeen a clapperboard shows the number of the scene and the number of takes and hitchcock would often take the two numbers on the clapperboard and whisper the london tram route names for example if the clapperboard showed scene 23 take 3 he would whisper woodford

that most of the staff were americans with strict job specifications but the english workers were encouraged to try their hand at anything which meant that hitchcock gained experience as a cowriter

film ever made when he returned to england hitchcock was one of the early members of the london film society newly formed in 1925 through the society he became fascinated by the work by soviet filmmakers dziga vertov lev kuleshov sergei eisenstein and vsevolod pudovkin he would also socialise with fellow english filmmakers ivor montagu adrian brunel and walter mycroft hitchcock established himself as a name director with his first thriller the lodger a story of the london fog 1927 the film concerns the hunt for a jack the ripperstyle serial killer who wearing a black cloak and carrying a black bag is murdering young blonde women in london and only on tuesdays a landlady suspects that her lodger is the killer but he turns out to be innocent hitchcock had wanted the leading man to be guilty or for the film at least to end ambiguously but the star was ivor novello a matinée idol and the star system meant that novello could not be the villain hitchcock told truffaut you have to clearly spell it out in big letters he is innocent he had the same problem years later with cary grant in suspicion 1941 released in january 1927 the lodger was a commercial and critical success in the uk upon its release the trade journal bioscope wrote it is possible that this film is the finest british production ever made hitchcock told truffaut that the film was the first of his to be

is a scriptwriter the third is the mother of my daughter pat and the fourth is as fine a cook as ever performed miracles in a domestic kitchen and their names are alma reville reville wrote or cowrote on many of hitchcocks films including shadow of a doubt suspicion and the 39 steps early sound films hitchcock began work on his tenth film blackmail 1929 when its production company british international pictures bip converted its elstree studios to sound the film was the first british talkie this followed the rapid development of sound films in the united states from the use of brief sound segments in the jazz singer 1927 to the first full sound feature lights of new york 1928 blackmail began the hitchcock tradition of using famous landmarks as a backdrop for suspense sequences with the climax taking place on the dome of the british museum it also features one of his longest cameo appearances which shows him being bothered by a small boy as he reads a book on the london underground in the pbs series the men who made the movies hitchcock explained how he used early sound recording as a special element of the film to create tension with a gossipy woman phyllis monkman stressing the word knife in her conversation with the woman suspected of murder during this period hitchcock directed segments for a bip revue elstree calling 1930 and directed a short film an elastic affair 1930 featuring two film weekly scholarship winners an elastic affair is one of the lost films in 1933 hitchcock signed a multifilm contract with gaumontbritish once again working for michael balcon his first film for the company the man who knew too much 1934 was a success his second the 39 steps 1935 was acclaimed in the uk and gained him recognition in the united states it also established the quintessential english hitchcock blonde madeleine carroll as the template for his succession of icecold elegant leading ladies screenwriter robert towne remarked its not much of an exaggeration to say that all contemporary escapist entertainment begins with the 39 steps john buchan author of the thirtynine steps on which the film is loosely based met with hitchcock on set and attended the highprofile premiere at the new gallery cinema in london upon viewing the film the author said it had improved on the book this film was one of the first to introduce the macguffin plot device a term coined by the english screenwriter angus macphail the macguffin is an item or goal the protagonist is pursuing one that otherwise has no narrative value in the 39 steps the macguffin is a stolen set of design plans hitchcock released two spy thrillers in 1936 sabotage was loosely based on joseph conrads novel the secret agent 1907 about a woman who discovers that her husband is a terrorist and secret agent based on two stories in ashenden or the british agent 1928 by w somerset maugham at this time hitchcock also became notorious for pranks against the cast and crew these jokes ranged from simple and innocent to crazy and maniacal for instance he hosted a dinner party where he dyed all the food blue because he claimed there werent enough blue foods he also had a horse delivered to the dressing room of his friend actor gerald du maurier hitchcock followed up with young and innocent in 1937 a crime thriller based on the 1936 novel a shilling for candles by josephine tey starring nova pilbeam and derrick de marney the film was relatively enjoyable for the cast and crew to make to meet distribution purposes in america the films runtime was cut and this included removal of one of hitchcocks favourite scenes a childrens tea party which becomes menacing to the protagonists hitchcocks next major success was the lady vanishes 1938 one of the greatest train movies from the genres golden era according to philip french in which miss froy may whitty a british spy posing as a governess disappears on a train journey through the fictional european country of bandrika the film saw hitchcock receive the 1938 new york film critics circle award for best director benjamin crisler of the new york times wrote in june 1938 three unique and valuable institutions the british have that we in america have not magna carta the tower bridge and alfred hitchcock the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world the film was based on the novel the wheel spins 1936 written by ethel lina white by 1938 hitchcock was aware that he had reached his peak in britain he had received numerous offers from producers in the united states but he turned them all down because he disliked the contractual obligations or thought the projects were repellent however producer david o selznick offered him a concrete proposal to make a film based on the sinking of titanic which was eventually shelved but selznick persuaded hitchcock to come to hollywood in july 1938 hitchcock flew to new york and found that he was already a celebrity he was featured in magazines and gave

food in west hollywood but still carried on his way of life from england he was impressed with hollywoods filmmaking culture expansive budgets and efficiency compared to the limits that he had often faced in britain in june that year life called him the greatest master of melodrama in screen history although hitchcock and selznick respected each other their working arrangements were sometimes difficult selznick suffered from constant financial problems and hitchcock was often unhappy about selznicks creative control and interference over his films selznick was also displeased with hitchcocks method of shooting just what was in the script and nothing more which meant that the film could not be cut and remade differently at a later time as well as complaining about hitchcocks goddamn jigsaw cutting their personalities were mismatched hitchcock was reserved whereas selznick was flamboyant eventually selznick generously lent hitchcock to the larger film studios selznick made only a few films each year as did fellow independent producer samuel goldwyn so he did not always have projects for hitchcock to direct goldwyn had also negotiated with hitchcock on a possible contract only to be outbid by selznick in a later interview hitchcock said selznick was the big producer  producer was king the most flattering thing mr selznick ever said about meand it shows you the amount of controlhe said i was the only director hed trust with a film hitchcock approached american cinema cautiously his first american film was set in england in which the americanness of the characters was incidental rebecca 1940 was set in a hollywood version of englands cornwall and based on a novel by english novelist daphne du maurier selznick insisted on a faithful adaptation of the

thriller foreign correspondent 1940 set in europe based on vincent sheeans book personal history 1935 and produced by walter wanger it was nominated for best picture that year hitchcock felt uneasy living and working in hollywood while britain was at war his concern resulted in a film that overtly supported the british war effort filmed in 1939 it was inspired by the rapidly changing events in europe as covered by an american newspaper reporter played by joel mccrea by mixing footage of european scenes with scenes filmed on a hollywood backlot the film avoided direct references to nazism nazi germany and germans to comply with the motion picture production code at the timedecember 2017 early war years in september 1940 the hitchcocks bought the 200 cornwall ranch near scotts valley

plays johnnie aysgarth an english conman whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his shy young english wife lina mclaidlaw joan fontaine in one scene hitchcock placed a light inside a glass of milk perhaps poisoned that grant is bringing to his wife the light ensures that the audiences attention is on the glass grants character is actually a killer as per written in the book before the fact by francis iles but the studio felt that grants image would be tarnished by that hitchcock therefore settled for an ambiguous finale although he would have preferred to end with the wifes murder

unhappy with the film and asked that his name be removed from the credits to no avail the idea was rewritten as a short story by harry sylvester and published in colliers in 1943 the action sequences

bendix is reading in the boat showing the director in a beforeandafter advertisement for reducoobesity slayer he told truffaut in 1962 hitchcocks typical dinner before his weight loss had been a roast chicken boiled ham potatoes bread vegetables relishes salad dessert a bottle of wine and some brandy to lose weight his diet consisted of black coffee for breakfast and lunch and steak and salad for

hitchcock formed an independent production company transatlantic pictures with his friend sidney bernstein he made two films with transatlantic one of which was his first colour film with rope 1948 hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment as he had done earlier with lifeboat the film appears as a very limited number of continuous shots but it was actually shot in 10 ranging from 4 to 10 minutes each a 10minute length of film was the most that a cameras film magazine could hold at the time some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment hitchcock used those points to hide the cut and began the next take with the camera in the same place the film features james stewart in the leading role and was the first of four films that stewart made with hitchcock it was inspired by the leopold and loeb case of the 1920s critical response at the time was mixed under capricorn 1949 set in 19thcentury

series alfred hitchcock presents with his droll delivery gallows humour and iconic image the series made hitchcock a celebrity the titlesequence of the show pictured a minimalist caricature of his profile he drew it himself it is composed of only nine strokes which his real silhouette then filled the series theme tune was funeral march of a marionette by the french composer charles gounod

collections in his name these included alfred hitchcocks anthology stories they wouldnt let me do on tv and tales my mother never told me in 1956 hsd publications also licensed the directors name to create alfred hitchcocks mystery magazine a monthly digest specialising in crime and detective fiction hitchcocks television series were very profitable and his foreignlanguage versions of books were bringing revenues of up to 100000 a year us from to catch a thief to vertigo in 1955 hitchcock became a united states citizen in the same year his third grace kelly film to catch a thief was released it is set in the french riviera and stars kelly and cary grant grant plays retired thief john robie who becomes the prime suspect for a spate of robberies in the riviera a thrillseeking american heiress played by kelly surmises his true identity and tries to seduce him despite the obvious age disparity between grant and kelly and a lightweight plot the witty script loaded with double entendres and the goodnatured acting proved a commercial success it was hitchcocks last film with kelly she married prince rainier of monaco in 1956 and ended her film career afterward hitchcock then remade his own 1934 film the man who knew too much in 1956 this time the film starred james stewart and doris day who sang the theme song que sera sera which won the academy award for best original song and became a big hit they play a couple whose son is kidnapped to prevent them from interfering with an assassination as in the 1934 film the climax takes place at the royal albert hall the wrong man 1956 hitchcocks final film for warner bros is a lowkey blackandwhite production based on a reallife case of mistaken identity reported in life magazine in 1953 this was the only film of hitchcock to star henry fonda playing a stork club musician mistaken for a liquor store thief who is arrested and tried for robbery while his wife vera miles emotionally collapses under the strain hitchcock told truffaut that his lifelong fear of the police attracted him to the subject and was embedded in many scenes while directing episodes for alfred hitchcock presents during the summer of 1957 hitchcock was admitted to hospital for hernia and gallstones and had to have his gallbladder removed following a successful surgery he immediately returned to work to prepare for his next project vertigo 1958 again starred james stewart with kim novak and barbara bel geddes he had wanted vera miles to play the lead but she was pregnant he told oriana fallaci i was offering her a big part the chance to become a beautiful sophisticated blonde a real actress wed have spent a heap of dollars on it and she has the bad taste to get pregnant i hate pregnant women because then they have children in vertigo stewart plays scottie a former police investigator suffering from acrophobia who becomes obsessed with a woman he has been hired to shadow novak scotties obsession leads to tragedy and this time hitchcock did not opt for a happy ending some critics including donald spoto and roger ebert agree that vertigo is the directors most personal and revealing film dealing with the pygmalionlike obsessions of a man who moulds a woman into the person he desires vertigo explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death than any other work in his filmography vertigo contains a camera technique developed by irmin roberts commonly referred to as a dolly zoom which has been copied by many filmmakers the film premiered at the san sebastián international film festival and hitchcock won the silver seashell prize vertigo is considered a classic but it attracted mixed reviews and poor boxoffice receipts at the time the critic from variety opined that the film was too slow and too long bosley crowther of the new york times thought it was devilishly farfetched but praised the cast performances and hitchcocks direction the picture was also the last collaboration between stewart and hitchcock in the 2002 sight  sound polls it ranked just behind citizen kane 1941 ten years later in the same magazine critics chose it as the best film ever made north by northwest and psycho after vertigo the rest of 1958 was a difficult year for hitchcock during preproduction of north by northwest 1959 which was a slow and agonising process his wife alma was diagnosed with cancer while she was in hospital hitchcock kept himself occupied with his television work and would visit her every day alma underwent surgery and made a full recovery but it caused hitchcock to imagine for the first time life without her hitchcock followed up with three more successful films which are also recognised as among his best north by northwest psycho 1960 and the birds 1963 in north by northwest cary grant portrays roger thornhill a madison avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent he is pursued across the united states by enemy agents including eve kendall eva marie saint at first thornhill believes kendall is helping him but then realises that she is an enemy agent he later learns that she is working undercover for

early death of the heroine and the innocent lives extinguished by a disturbed murderer became the hallmarks of a new horrorfilm genre the film proved popular with audiences with lines stretching outside theatres as viewers waited for the next showing it broke boxoffice records in the united kingdom france south america the united states and canada and was a moderate success in australia for a brief perioddecember 2017 psycho was the most profitable of hitchcocks career and he personally earned in excess of 15 million equivalent to us million in us he subsequently swapped his rights to psycho and his tv anthology for 150000 shares of mca making him the third largest shareholder and his own boss at universal in theory at least although that did not stop studio interferencejanuary 2018 following the first film psycho became an american horror franchise psycho ii psycho iii bates motel psycho iv the beginning and a colour 1998 remake of the original truffaut interview on 13 august 1962 hitchcocks 63rd birthday the french director françois truffaut began a 50hour interview of hitchcock filmed over eight days at universal studios during which hitchcock agreed to answer 500 questions it took four years to transcribe the tapes and organise the images it was published as a book in 1967 which truffaut nicknamed the hitchbook the audio tapes were used as the basis of a documentary in 2015 truffaut sought the interview because it was clear to him that hitchcock was not simply the massmarket entertainer the american media made him out to be it was obvious from his films truffaut wrote that hitchcock had given more thought to the potential of his art than any of his colleagues he compared the interview to oedipus consultation of the oracle the birds the film scholar peter william evans wrote that the birds 1963 and marnie 1964 are regarded as undisputed masterpieces hitchcock had intended to film marnie first and in march 1962 it was announced that grace kelly princess grace of monaco since 1956 would come out of retirement to star in it when kelly asked hitchcock to postpone marnie until 1963 or 1964 he recruited evan hunter author of the blackboard jungle 1954 to develop a screenplay based on a daphne du maurier short story the birds 1952 which hitchcock had republished in his my favorites in suspense 1959 he hired tippi hedren to play the lead role it was her first role she had been a model in new york when hitchcock saw her in october 1961 in an nbc television advert for sego a diet drink i signed her because she is a classic beauty movies dont have them any more grace kelly was the last he insisted without explanation that her first name be written in single quotation marks tippi in the birds melanie daniels a young socialite meets lawyer mitch brenner rod taylor in a bird shop jessica tandy plays his possessive mother hedren visits him in bodega bay where the birds was filmed carrying a pair of lovebirds as a gift suddenly waves of birds start gathering watching and attacking the question what do the birds want is left unanswered hitchcock made the film with equipment from the revue studio which made alfred hitchcock presents he said it was his most technically challenging film using a combination of trained and mechanical birds against a backdrop of wild ones every shot was sketched in advance an hbobbc television film the girl 2012 depicted hedrens experiences on set she said that hitchcock became obsessed with her and sexually harassed her he reportedly isolated her from the rest of the crew had her followed whispered obscenities to her had her handwriting analysed and had a ramp built from his private office directly into her trailer diane baker her costar in marnie said nothing could have been more horrible for me than to arrive on that movie set and to see her being treated the way she was while filming the attack scene in the attic  which took a week to film  she was placed in a caged room while two men wearing elbowlength protective gloves threw live birds at her toward the end of the week to stop the birds flying away from her too soon one leg of each bird was attached by nylon thread to elastic bands sewn inside her clothes she broke down after a bird cut her lower eyelid and filming was halted on doctors orders marnie in june 1962 grace kelly announced that she had decided against appearing in marnie 1964 hedren had signed an exclusive sevenyear 500aweek contract with hitchcock in october 1961 and he decided to cast her in the lead role opposite sean connery in 2016 describing hedrens performance as one of the greatest in the history of cinema richard brody called the film a story of sexual violence inflicted on the character played by hedren the film is to put it simply sick and its so because hitchcock was sick he suffered all his life from furious sexual desire suffered from the lack of its gratification suffered from the inability to transform fantasy into reality and then went ahead and did so virtually by way of his art a 1964 new york times review called it hitchcocks most disappointing film in years citing hedrens and connerys lack of experience an amateurish script and glaringly fake cardboard backdrops in the film marnie edgar hedren steals 10000 from her employer and goes on the run she applies for a job at mark rutlands connery company in philadelphia and steals from there too earlier she is shown having a panic attack during a thunderstorm and fearing the colour red mark tracks her down and blackmails her into marrying him she explains that she does not want to be touched but during the honeymoon mark rapes her marnie and mark discover that marnies mother had been a prostitute when marnie was a child and that while the mother was fighting with a client during a thunderstorm  the mother believed the client had tried to molest marnie  marnie had killed the client to save her mother cured of her fears when she remembers what happened she decides to stay with mark hitchcock told cinematographer robert burks that the camera had to be placed as close as possible to hedren when he filmed her face evan hunter the screenwriter of the birds who was writing marnie too explained to hitchcock that if mark loved marnie he would comfort her not rape her hitchcock reportedly replied evan when he sticks it in her i want that camera right on her face when hunter submitted two versions of the script one without the rape scene hitchcock replaced him with jay presson allen later years 19661980 final films failing health reduced hitchcocks output during the last two decades of his life biographer stephen rebello claimed universal imposed two films on him torn curtain 1966 and topaz 1969 the latter of which is based on a leon uris novel partly set in cuba both were spy thrillers with cold warrelated themes torn curtain with paul newman and julie andrews precipitated the bitter end of the twelveyear collaboration between hitchcock and composer bernard herrmann hitchcock was unhappy with herrmanns score and replaced him with john addison jay livingston and ray evans upon release torn curtain was a box office disappointment and topaz was disliked by both critics and the studio hitchcock returned to britain to make his penultimate film frenzy 1972 based on the novel goodbye piccadilly farewell leicester square 1966 after two espionage films the plot marked a return to the murderthriller genre richard blaney jon finch a volatile barman with a history of explosive anger becomes the prime suspect in the investigation into the necktie murders which are actually committed by his friend bob rusk barry foster this time hitchcock makes the victim and villain kindreds rather than opposites as in strangers on a train in frenzy hitchcock allowed nudity for the first time two scenes show naked women one of whom is being raped and strangled donald spoto called the latter one of the most repellent examples of a detailed murder in the history of film both actors barbara leighhunt and anna massey refused to do the scenes so models were used instead biographers have noted that hitchcock had always pushed the limits of film censorship often managing to fool joseph breen the head of the motion picture production code hitchcock would add subtle hints of improprieties forbidden by censorship until the mid1960s yet patrick mcgilligan wrote that breen and others often realised that hitchcock was inserting such material and were actually amused as well as alarmed by hitchcocks inescapable inferences family plot 1976 was hitchcocks last film it relates the escapades of madam blanche tyler played by barbara harris a fraudulent spiritualist and her taxidriver lover bruce dern making a living from her phony powers while family plot was based on the victor canning novel the rainbird pattern 1972 the novels tone is more sinister screenwriter ernest lehman originally wrote the film under the working title deception with a dark tone but was pushed to a lighter more comical tone by hitchcock where it took the name deceit then finally family plot knighthood and death toward the end of his life hitchcock was working on the script for a spy thriller the short night collaborating with james costigan ernest lehman and david freeman despite preliminary work it was never filmed hitchcocks health was declining and he was worried about his wife who had suffered a stroke the screenplay was eventually published in freemans book the last days of alfred hitchcock 1999 having refused a cbe in 1962 hitchcock was appointed a knight commander of the most excellent order of the british empire kbe in the 1980 new year honours he was too ill to travel to londonhe had a pacemaker and was being given cortisone injections for his arthritisso on 3 january 1980 the british consul general presented him with the papers at universal studios asked by a reporter after the ceremony why it had taken the queen so long hitchcock quipped i suppose it was a matter of carelessness cary grant janet leigh and others attended a luncheon afterwards his last public appearance was on 16 march 1980 when he introduced the next years winner of the american film institute award he died of kidney failure the following month on 29 april in his bel air home donald spoto one of hitchcocks biographers wrote that hitchcock had declined to see a priest but according to jesuit priest mark henninger he and another priest tom sullivan celebrated mass at the filmmakers home and sullivan heard his confession hitchcock was survived by his wife and daughter his funeral was held at good shepherd catholic church in beverly hills on 30 april after which his body was cremated his remains were scattered over the pacific ocean on 10 may 1980 filmmaking style and themes the hitchcockian style includes the use of editing and camera movement to mimic a persons gaze thereby turning viewers into voyeurs and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear the film critic robin wood wrote that the meaning of a hitchcock film is there in the method in the progression from shot to shot a hitchcock film is an organism with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole hitchcocks film production career evolved from smallscale silent films to financially significant sound films hitchcock remarked that he was influenced by early filmmakers george méliès dw griffith and alice guyblaché his silent films between 1925 and 1929 were in the crime and suspense genres but also included melodramas and comedies whilst visual storytelling was pertinent during the silent era even after the arrival of sound hitchcock still relied on visuals in cinema he referred to this emphasis on visual storytelling as pure cinema in britain he honed his craft so that by the time he moved to hollywood the director had perfected his style and camera techniques hitchcock later said that his british work was the sensation of cinema whereas the american phase was when his ideas were fertilised scholar robin wood writes that the directors first two films the pleasure garden and the mountain eagle were influenced by german expressionism afterward he discovered soviet cinema and sergei eisensteins and vsevolod pudovkins theories of montage 1926s the lodger was inspired by both german and soviet aesthetics styles which solidified the rest of his career although hitchcocks work in the 1920s found some success several british reviewers criticised hitchcocks films for being unoriginal and conceited raymond durgnat opined that hitchcocks films were carefully and intelligently constructed but thought they can be shallow and rarely present a coherent worldview earning the title master of suspense the director experimented with ways to generate tension in his work he said my suspense work comes out of creating nightmares for the audience and i play with an audience i make them gasp and surprise them and shock them when you have a nightmare its awfully vivid if youre dreaming that youre being led to the electric chair then youre as happy as can be when you wake up because youre relieved during filming of north by northwest hitchcock explained his reasons for recreating the set of mount rushmore the audience responds in proportion to how realistic you make it one of the dramatic reasons for this type of photography is to get it looking so natural that the audience gets involved and believes for the time being whats going on up there on the screen in a 1963 interview with italian journalist oriana fallaci hitchcock was asked how in spite of appearing to be a pleasant innocuous man he seemed to enjoy making films involving suspense and terrifying crime he respondedim english the english use a lot of imagination with their crimes i dont get such a kick out of anything as much as out of imagining a crime when im writing a story and i come to a crime i think happily now wouldnt it be nice to have him die like this and then even more happily i think at this point people will start yelling it must be because i spent three years studying with the jesuits they used to terrify me to death with everything and now im getting my own back by terrifying other people hitchcocks films from the silent to the sound era contained a number of recurring themes that he is famous for his films explored audience as a voyeur notably in rear window marnie and psycho he understood that human beings enjoy voyeuristic activities and made the audience participate in it through the characters actions of his fiftythree films eleven revolved around stories of mistaken identity where an innocent protagonist is accused of a crime and is pursued by police in most cases it is an ordinary everyday person who finds themselves in a dangerous situation hitchcock told truffaut thats because the theme of the innocent man being accused i feel provides the audience with a greater sense of danger its easier for them to identify with him than with a guilty man on the run one of his constant themes were the struggle of a personality torn between order and chaos known as the notion of double which is a comparison or contrast between two characters or objects the double representing a dark or evil side according to robin wood hitchcock retained a feeling of ambivalence towards homosexuality despite working with gay actors throughout his career donald spoto suggests that hitchcocks sexually repressive childhood may have contributed to his exploration of deviancy during the 1950s the motion picture production code prohibited direct references to homosexuality but the director was known for his subtle references and pushing the boundaries of the censors moreover shadow of a doubt has a double incest theme through the storyline expressed implicitly through images author jane sloan argues that hitchcock was drawn to both conventional and unconventional sexual expression in his work and the theme of marriage was usually presented in a bleak and skeptical manner it was also not until after his mothers death in 1942 that hitchcock portrayed motherly figures as notorious monstermothers the espionage backdrop and murders committed by characters with psychopathic tendencies were common themes too in hitchcocks depiction of villains and murderers they were usually charming and friendly forcing viewers to identify with them the directors strict childhood and jesuit education may have led to his distrust of authoritarian figures such as policemen and politicians a theme which he has explored also he used the macguffinthe use of an object person or event to keep the plot moving along even if it was nonessential to the story some examples include the microfilm in north by northwest and the stolen 40000 in psycho hitchcock appears briefly in most of his own films for example he is seen struggling to get a double bass onto a train strangers on a train walking dogs out of a pet shop the birds fixing a neighbours clock rear window as a shadow family plot sitting at a table in a photograph dial m for murder and riding a bus north by northwest to catch a thief representation of women hitchcocks portrayal of women has been the subject of much scholarly debate bidisha wrote in the guardian in 2010 theres the vamp the tramp the snitch the witch the slink the doublecrosser and best of all the demon mommy dont worry they all get punished in the end in a widely cited essay in 1975 laura mulvey introduced the idea of the male gaze the view of the spectator in hitchcocks films she argued is that of the heterosexual male protagonist the female characters in his films reflected the same qualities over and over again roger ebert wrote in 1996 they were blonde they were icy and remote they were imprisoned in costumes that subtly combined fashion with fetishism they mesmerised the men who often had physical or psychological handicaps sooner or later every hitchcock woman was humiliated hitchcocks films often feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers such as norman bates in psycho in north by northwest roger thornhill cary grant is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy murderous men are after him in the birds the rod taylor character an innocent man finds his world under attack by vicious birds and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother jessica tandy the killer in frenzy has a loathing of women but idolises his mother the villain bruno in strangers on a train hates his father but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother played by marion lorne sebastian claude rains in notorious has a clearly conflicting relationship with his mother who is rightly suspicious of his new bride alicia huberman ingrid bergman relationship with actors hitchcock became known for having remarked that actors should be treated like cattle during the filming of mr  mrs smith 1941 carole lombard brought three cows onto the set wearing the name tags of lombard robert montgomery and gene raymond the stars of the film to surprise him in an episode of the dick cavett show originally broadcast on 8 june 1972 dick cavett stated as fact that hitchcock had once called actors cattle hitchcock responded by saying that at one time he had been accused of calling actors cattle i said that i would never say such an unfeeling rude thing about actors at all what i probably said was that all actors should be treated like cattlein a nice way of course he then described carole lombards joke with a smile hitchcock believed that actors should concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters he told bryan forbes in 1967 i remember discussing with a method actor how he was taught and so forth he said were taught using improvisation we are given an idea and then we are turned loose to develop in any way we want to i said thats not acting thats writing recalling their experiences on lifeboat for charles chandler author of its only a movie alfred hitchcock a personal biography walter slezak said that hitchcock knew more about how to help an actor than any director i ever worked with and hume cronyn dismissed the idea that hitchcock was not concerned with his actors as utterly fallacious describing at length the process of rehearsing and filming lifeboat critics observed that despite his reputation as a man who disliked actors actors who worked with him often gave brilliant performances he used the same actors in many of his films cary grant and james stewart both worked with hitchcock four times and ingrid bergman and grace kelly three james mason said that hitchcock regarded actors as animated props for hitchcock the actors were part of the films setting he told françois truffaut the chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well which is by no means as easy as it sounds he should be willing to be used and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera he must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights writing storyboards and production hitchcock planned his scripts in detail with his writers in writing with hitchcock 2001 steven derosa noted that hitchcock supervised them through every draft asking that they tell the story visually hitchcock told roger ebert in 1969 hitchcocks films were extensively storyboarded to the finest detail he was reported to have never even bothered looking through the viewfinder since he did not need to although in publicity photos he was shown doing so he also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision if a studio asked him to change a film he would claim that it was already shot in a single way and that there were no alternative takes to consider this view of hitchcock as a director who relied more on preproduction than on the actual production itself has been challenged by bill krohn the american correspondent of french film magazine cahiers du cinéma in his book hitchcock at work after investigating script revisions notes to other production personnel written by or to hitchcock and other production material krohn observed that hitchcocks work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned he noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to hitchcock often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films was to a great degree perpetuated by hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios for example the celebrated cropspraying sequence of north by northwest was not storyboarded at all after the scene was filmed the publicity department asked hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film and hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detaildecember 2017 even when storyboards were made scenes that were shot differed from them significantly krohns analysis of the production of hitchcock classics like notorious reveals that hitchcock was flexible enough to change a films conception during its production another example krohn notes is the american remake of the man who knew too much whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule something that as krohn notes was not an uncommon occurrence on many of hitchcocks films including strangers on a train and topaz while hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films he was fully cognisant that the actual filmmaking process often deviated from the bestlaid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines used during many other film productionsdecember 2017 krohns work also sheds light on hitchcocks practice of generally shooting in chronological order which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and more importantly differed from the standard operating procedure of hollywood in the studio system era equally important is hitchcocks tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes this differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how they chose often under the producers aegisdecember 2017 rather they represented hitchcocks tendency to give himself options in the editing room where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work according to krohn this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of hitchcocks personal papers script revisions and the like refute the notion of hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films whose vision of his films did not change during production which krohn notes has remained the central longstanding myth of alfred hitchcock both his fastidiousness and attention to detail also found their way into each film poster for his films hitchcock preferred to work with the best talent of his dayfilm poster designers such as bill gold and saul basswho would produce posters that accurately represented his films legacy awards and honours hitchcock was inducted into the hollywood walk of fame on 8 february 1960 with two stars one for television and a second for motion pictures in 1978 john russell taylor described him as the most universally

2007 the daily telegraph critics poll ranked him britains greatest director david gritten the newspapers film critic wrote unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands hitchcock

similar name in use the word anaconda is derived from the name of a snake from ceylon sri lanka that john ray described in latin in his synopsis methodica animalium 1693 as serpens indicus bubalinus anacandaia zeylonibus ides bubalorum aliorumque jumentorum membra conterens ray used a catalogue of snakes from the leyden museum supplied by dr tancred robinson the description of its habit was based on andreas cleyer who in 1684 described a gigantic snake that crushed large animals by coiling around their bodies and crushing their bones henry yule in his 1886 work hobsonjobson notes that the word became more popular due to a piece of fiction published in 1768 in the scots magazine by a certain r edwin edwin described a tiger being crushed to death by an anaconda when there were never any tigers in sri lanka yule and frank wall noted that the snake was a python and suggested a tamil origin ta meaning elephant killer a sinhalese origin was also suggested by donald ferguson who pointed out that the word si si lightninglarge and si stemtrunk was used in sri lanka for the small whip snake ahaetulla pulverulenta and somehow got misapplied to the python before myths were created the name commonly used for the anaconda in brazil is sucuri sucuriju or sucuriuba distribution and habitat found in tropical south america from ecuador brazil colombia and venezuela south to argentina feeding all five species are aquatic snakes that prey on other aquatic animals including fish river fowl and caiman videos exist of anacondas preying on domestic animals such as goats and sometimes even jaguars that venture too close to the water relationship with humans while encounters between people and anacondas may be dangerous they do not regularly hunt humans nevertheless threat from anacondas is a familiar trope in comics movies and adventure stories often published in pulp magazines or adventure magazines set in the amazon jungle local communities and some european explorers have given accounts of giant anacondas legendary snakes of much greater proportion than any confirmed specimen although charismatic there is little known on the biology of wild anacondas most of our knowledge comes from the work of dr jesús a rivas and his team working in the venezuelan llanos species mating system the mating seasons in eunectes varies both between species and within species depending on locality although the trend appears to be the dry season the green anaconda e murinus is the most wellstudied species of eunectes in terms of their mating system followed by the yellow anaconda e notaeus unfortunately e deschauenseei and e beniensis are much less common making the specific details of their mating systems less well understood sexual dimorphism sexual size dimorphism in eunectes is the opposite of most other vertebrates females are larger than males in most snakes and green anacondas e murinus have one of the most extreme size differences where females average roughly 32 and males average only around 7 this size difference has several benefits for both sexes large size in females leads to higher fecundity and larger offspring as a result male mate choice favours larger females large size is also favoured in males because larger males tend to be more successful at reproducing both because of their size advantage in endurance rivalry and their advantage in sperm competition because larger males are able to produce more sperm one reason that males are so much smaller in eunectes is that large males can be confused for females which interferes with their ability to mate when smaller males mistakenly coil them in breeding balls as a result there is an optimum size for males where they are large enough to successfully compete but not large enough to risk other males trying to mate with them breeding balls during the mating season female anacondas release pheromones to attract males for breeding which can result in polyandrous breeding balls these breeding balls have been observed in e murinus e notaeus and e deschauenseei and likely also occur in e beniensis in the green anaconda e murinus up to 13 males have been observed in a breeding ball which have been recorded to last two weeks on average in anaconda breeding balls several males coil around one female and attempt to position themselves as close to her cloaca as possible where they use their pelvic spurs to tickle and encourage her to allow penetration since there are often many males present and only one male can mate with the female at a time the success of a male often depends on his persistence and endurance because physical combat is not a part of the eunectes mating ritual apart from firmly pushing against other males in an attempt to secure the best position on the female sexual cannibalism cannibalism is quite easy in anacondas since females are so much larger than males but sexual cannibalism has only been confirmed in e murinus females gain the direct benefit of a postcopulatory highprotein meal when they consume their mates along with the indirect benefit of additional resources to use for the formation of offspring cannibalism in general outside of the breeding season has been confirmed in all but e deschauenseei although it is likely that it occurs in all eunectes species asexual reproduction although sexual reproduction is by far the most common in eunectes e murinus has been observed to undergo facultative parthenogenesis in both cases the females had lived in isolation from other anacondas for over eight years and dna analysis showed that the few fully formed offspring were genetically identical to the mothers although this is not commonly observed it is likely possible in all species of eunectes and several other species of boidae indigenous mythology according to the founding myth of the huni kuin a man named yube fell in love with an anaconda woman and was turned into an anaconda as well he began to live with her in the deep world of waters in this world yube discovered a hallucinogenic drink with healing powers and access to knowledge one day without telling his anaconda wife yube decided to return to the land of men and resume his old human form the myth also explains the origin of cipó or ayahuasca  a hallucinogenic drink taken ritualistically by the huni kuin see also notes references further reading external links altaic languages categories altaic languages agglutinative languages central asia proposed language families altaic æ is a controversial proposed language family that would include the turkic mongolic and tungusic language families and possibly also the japonic and koreanic languages73 the hypothetical language family has long been rejected by most comparative linguists although it continues to be supported by a small but stable scholarly minority speakers of the constituent languages are currently scattered over most of asia north of 35 n and in some eastern parts of europe extending in longitude from the balkan peninsula to japanjuly 2023 the group is named after the altai mountain range in the center of asia the altaic family was first proposed in the 18th century it was widely accepted until the 1960s and is still listed in many encyclopedias and handbooks and references to altaic as a language family continue to percolate to modern sources through these older sources since the 1950s most comparative linguists have rejected the proposal after supposed cognates were found not to be valid hypothesized sound shifts were not found and turkic and mongolic languages were found to be converging rather than diverging over the centuries the relationship between the altaic languages is now generally accepted to be the result of a sprachbund rather than common ancestry with the languages showing influence from prolonged contact the continued use of the term altaic to refer to the various iterations of an altaic theory the altaic sprachbund and infrequently as a general term for the region has resulted in confusion around the status of the altaic hypothesis with the end result being many altaicists adopting the name transeurasian for modifications of the family proposal to avoid confusion this confusion is compounded by literature that refers to altaic as an accepted hypothesis which historically was the case altaic has maintained a limited degree of scholarly support in contrast to some other early macrofamily proposals continued research on altaic is still being undertaken by a core group of academic linguists but their research has not found wider support in particular it has support from the institute of linguistics of the russian academy of sciences and remains influential as a substratum of turanism where a hypothetical common linguistic ancestor has been used in part as a basis for a multiethnic nationalist movement earliest attestations the earliest attested expressions in prototurkic are recorded in various chinese sources anna dybo identifies in shizi 330 bce and the book of han 111 ce several dozen prototurkic exotisms in chinese han transcriptions lanhai wei and hui li reconstruct the name of the xiōngnú ruling house as pt alayundluğ alajuntˈluγ piebald horse clan the earliest known texts in a turkic language are the orkhon inscriptions 720735 ad3 they were deciphered in 1893 by the danish linguist vilhelm thomsen in a scholarly race with his rival the germanrussian linguist wilhelm radloff however radloff was the first to publish the inscriptions the first tungusic language to be attested is jurchen the language of the ancestors of the manchus a writing system for it was devised in 1119 ad and an inscription using this system is known from 1185 see list of jurchen inscriptions the earliest mongolic language of which we have written evidence is known as middle mongol it is first attested by an inscription dated to 1224 or 1225 ad the stele of yisüngge and by the secret history of the mongols written in 1228 see mongolic languages the earliest paramongolic text is the memorial for yelü yanning written in the khitan large script and dated to 986 ad however the inscription of hüis tolgoi discovered in 1975 and analysed as being in an early form of mongolic has been dated to 604620 ad the bugut inscription dates back to 584 ad japanese is first attested in the form of names contained in a few short inscriptions in classical chinese from the 5th century ad such as found on the inariyama sword the first substantial text in japanese however is the kojiki which dates from 712 ad it is followed by the nihon shoki completed in 720 and then by the manyōshū which dates from c 771785 but includes material that is from about 400 years earlier4 the most important text for the study of early korean is the hyangga a collection of 25 poems of which some go back to the three kingdoms period 57 bc668 ad but are preserved in an orthography that only goes back to the 9th century ad60 korean is copiously attested from the mid15th century on in the phonetically precise hangul system of writing61 history of the altaic family concept origins the earliest known reference to a unified language group of turkic mongolic and tungusic languages is from the 1692 work of nicolaes witsen which may be based on a 1661 work of abu alghazi bahadur genealogy of the turkmens a proposed grouping of the turkic mongolic and tungusic languages was published in 1730 by philip johan von strahlenberg a swedish officer who traveled in the eastern russian empire while a prisoner of war after the great northern warpage 125 however he may not have intended to imply a closer relationship among those languages later proposals to include the korean and japanese languages into a macroaltaic family have always been controversial the original proposal was sometimes called microaltaic by retronymy most proponents of altaic continue to support the inclusion of korean but fewer do for japanese some proposals also included ainuic but this is not widely accepted even among altaicists themselves a common ancestral protoaltaic language for the macro family has been tentatively reconstructed by sergei starostin and others microaltaic includes about 66 living languages to which macroaltaic would add korean jeju japanese and the ryukyuan languages for a total of about 74 depending on what is considered a language and what is considered a dialect these numbers do not include earlier states of languages such as middle mongol old korean or old japanese uraloaltaic hypothesis in 1844 the finnish philologist matthias castrén proposed a broader grouping which later came to be called the uralaltaic family which included turkic mongolian and manchutungus tungusic as an altaic branch and also the finnougric and samoyedic languages as the uralic branch though castrén himself used the terms tataric and chudic126127 the name altaic referred to the altai mountains in eastcentral asia which are approximately the center of the geographic range of the three main families the name uralic referred to the ural mountains while the uralaltaic family hypothesis can still be found in some encyclopedias atlases and similar general references since the 1960s it has been heavily criticized even linguists who accept the basic altaic family such as sergei starostin completely discard the inclusion of the uralic branch89 the term continues to be used for the central eurasian typological grammatical and lexical convergence zone indeed uralaltaic may be preferable to altaic in this sense for example juha janhunen states that speaking of altaic instead of uralaltaic is a misconception for there are no areal or typological features that are specific to altaic without uralic korean and japanese languages in 1857 the austrian scholar anton boller suggested adding japanese to the uralaltaic family34 in the 1920s gj ramstedt and ed polivanov advocated the inclusion of korean decades later in his 1952 book ramstedt rejected the uralaltaic hypothesis but again included korean in altaic an inclusion followed by most leading altaicists supporters of the theory to date his book contained the first comprehensive attempt to identify regular correspondences among the sound systems within the altaic language families in 1960 nicholas poppe published what was in effect a heavily revised version of ramstedts volume on phonology that has since set the standard in altaic studies poppe considered the issue of the relationship of korean to turkicmongolictungusic not settled148 in his view there were three possibilities 1 korean did not belong with the other three genealogically but had been influenced by an altaic substratum 2 korean was related to the other three at the same level they were related to each other 3 korean had split off from the other three before they underwent a series of characteristic changes roy andrew millers 1971 book japanese and the other altaic languages convinced most altaicists that japanese also belonged to altaic since then the macroaltaic has been generally assumed to include turkic mongolic tungusic korean and japanese in 1990 unger advocated a family consisting of tungusic korean and japonic languages but not turkic or mongolic however many linguists dispute the alleged affinities of korean and japanese to the other three groups some authors instead tried to connect japanese to the austronesian languages89 in 2017 martine robbeets proposed that japanese and possibly korean originated as a hybrid language she proposed that the ancestral home of the turkic mongolic and tungusic languages was somewhere in northwestern manchuria a group of those protoaltaic transeurasian speakers would have migrated south into the modern liaoning province where they would have been mostly assimilated by an agricultural community with an austronesianlike language the fusion of the two languages would have resulted in protojapanese and protokorean in a typological study that does not directly evaluate the validity of the altaic hypothesis yurayong and szeto 2020 discuss for koreanic and japonic the stages of convergence to the altaic typological model and subsequent divergence from that model which resulted in the present typological similarity between koreanic and japonic they state that both are still so different from the core altaic languages that we can even speak of an independent japanesekorean type of grammar given also that there is neither a strong proof of common protoaltaic lexical items nor solid regular sound correspondences but rather only lexical and structural borrowings between languages of the altaic typology our results indirectly speak in favour of a paleoasiatic origin of the japonic and koreanic languages the ainu language in 1962 john c street proposed an alternative classification with turkicmongolictungusic in one grouping and koreanjapaneseainu in another joined in what he designated as the north asiatic family the inclusion of ainu was adopted also by james patrie in 1982 the turkicmongolictungusic and koreanjapaneseainu groupings were also posited in 20002002 by joseph greenberg however he treated them as independent members of a larger family which he termed eurasiatic the inclusion of ainu is not widely accepted by altaicists in fact no convincing genealogical relationship between ainu and any other language family has been demonstrated and it is generally regarded as a language isolate early criticism and rejection starting in the late 1950s some linguists became increasingly critical of even the minimal altaic family hypothesis disputing the alleged evidence of genetic connection between turkic mongolic and tungusic languages among the earlier critics were gerard clauson 1956 gerhard doerfer 1963 and alexander shcherbak they claimed that the words and features shared by turkic mongolic and tungusic languages were for the most part borrowings and that the rest could be attributed to chance resemblances in 1988 doerfer again rejected all the genetic claims over these major groups modern controversy a major continuing supporter of the altaic hypothesis has been sergei starostin who published a comparative lexical analysis of the altaic languages in 1991 he concluded that the analysis supported the altaic grouping although it was older than most other language families in eurasia such as indoeuropean or finnougric and this is the reason why the modern altaic languages preserve few common elements in 1991 and again in 1996 roy miller defended the altaic hypothesis and claimed that the criticisms of clauson and doerfer apply exclusively to the lexical correspondences whereas the most pressing evidence for the theory is the similarities in verbal morphology in 2003 claus schönig published a critical overview of the history of the altaic hypothesis up to that time siding with the earlier criticisms of clauson doerfer and shcherbak in 2003 starostin anna dybo and oleg mudrak published the etymological dictionary of the altaic languages which expanded the 1991 lexical lists and added other phonological and grammatical arguments starostins book was criticized by stefan georg in 2004 and 2005 and by alexander vovin in 2005 other defenses of the theory in response to the criticisms of georg and vovin were published by starostin in 2005 blažek in 2006 robbeets in 2007 and dybo and g starostin in 2008 in 2010 lars johanson echoed millers 1996 rebuttal to the critics and called for a muting of the polemic list of supporters and critics of the altaic hypothesis the list below comprises linguists who have worked specifically on the altaic problem since the publication of the first volume of ramstedts einführung in 1952 the dates given are those of works concerning altaic for supporters of the theory the version of altaic they favor is given at the end of the entry if other than the prevailing one of turkicmongolictungusickoreanjapanese major supporters major critics advocates of alternative hypotheses transeurasian renaming in robbeets and johanson 2010 there was a proposal to replace the name altaic with the name transeurasian while altaic has sometimes included japonic koreanic and other languages or families but only on the consideration of particular authors transeurasian was specifically intended to always include turkic mongolic tungusic japonic and koreanic robbeets and johanson gave as their reasoning for the new term 1 to avoid confusion between the different uses of altaic as to which group of languages is included 2 to reduce the counterproductive polarization between proaltaists and antialtaists 3 to broaden the applicability of the term because the suffix ic implies affinity while an leaves room for an areal hypothesis and 4 to eliminate the reference to the altai mountains as a potential homeland in robbeets and savelyev ed 2020 there was a concerted effort to distinguish altaic as a subgroup of transeurasian consisting only of turkic mongolic and tungusic while retaining transeurasian as altaic plus japonic and koreanic arguments for the altaic grouping phonological and grammatical features the original arguments for grouping the microaltaic languages within a uraloaltaic family were based on such shared features as vowel harmony and agglutination according to roy miller the most pressing evidence for the theory is the similarities in verbal morphology the etymological dictionary by starostin and others 2003 proposes a set of sound change laws that would explain the evolution from protoaltaic to the descendant languages for example although most of todays altaic languages have vowel harmony protoaltaic as reconstructed by them lacked it instead various vowel assimilations between the first and second syllables of words occurred in turkic mongolic tungusic korean and japonic they also included a number of grammatical correspondences between the languages shared lexicon starostin claimed in 1991 that the members of the proposed altaic group shared about 1520 of apparent cognates within a 110word swadeshyakhontov list in particular turkicmongolic 20 turkictungusic 18 turkickorean 17 mongolictungusic 22 mongolickorean 16 and tungusickorean 21 the 2003 etymological dictionary includes a list of 2800 proposed cognate sets as well as a few important changes to the reconstruction of protoaltaic the authors tried hard to distinguish loans between turkic and mongolic and between mongolic and tungusic from cognates and suggest words that occur in turkic and tungusic but not in mongolic all other combinations between the five branches also occur in the book it lists 144 items of shared basic vocabulary including words for such items as eye ear neck bone blood water stone sun and two robbeets and bouckaert 2018 use bayesian phylolinguistic methods to argue for the coherence of the narrow altaic languages turkic mongolic and tungusic together with japonic and koreanic which they refer to as the transeurasian languages their results include the following phylogenetic tree martine robbeets et al 2021 argues that early transeurasian speakers were originally agriculturalists in northeastern asia only becoming pastoralists later on the analysis conducted by kassian et al 2021 on a 110item word list specifically developed for each of the languagesprototurkic protomongolic prototungusic middle korean and protojaponic indicated support for the altaic macrofamily while acknowledging that considering prehistoric contacts as an alternative explanation for the results is plausible they deem such a scenario less likely for turkic and japonic languages this assessment is based on the substantial geographical distances involved which can only be explained if a mutual relationship is assumed against the grouping weakness of lexical and typological data according to g clauson 1956 g doerfer 1963 and a shcherbak 1963 many of the typological features of the supposed altaic languages particularly agglutinative strongly suffixing morphology and subjectobjectverb sov word order often occur together in languages those critics also argued that the words and features shared by turkic mongolic and tungusic languages were for the most part borrowings and that the rest could be attributed to chance resemblances they noted that there was little vocabulary shared by turkic and tungusic languages though more shared with mongolic languages they reasoned that if all three families had a common ancestor we should expect losses to happen at random and not only at the geographical margins of the family and that the observed pattern is consistent with borrowing according to c schönig 2003 after accounting for areal effects the shared lexicon that could have a common genetic origin was reduced to a small number of monosyllabic lexical roots including the personal pronouns and a few other deictic and auxiliary items whose sharing could be explained in other ways not the kind of sharing expected in cases of genetic relationship the sprachbund hypothesis instead of a common genetic origin clauson doerfer and shcherbak proposed in 19561966 that turkic mongolic and tungusic languages form a sprachbund a set of languages with similarities due to convergence through intensive borrowing and long contact rather than common origin asya pereltsvaig further observed in 2011 that in general genetically related languages and families tend to diverge over time the earlier forms are more similar than modern forms however she claims that an analysis of the earliest written records of mongolic and turkic languages shows the opposite suggesting that they do not share a common traceable ancestor but rather have become more similar through language contact and areal effects hypothesis about the original homeland the prehistory of the peoples speaking the altaic languages is largely unknown whereas for certain other language families such as the speakers of indoeuropean uralic and austronesian it is possible to frame substantial hypotheses in the case of the proposed altaic family much remains to be done some scholars have hypothesised a possible uralic and altaic homeland in the central asian steppes chaubey and van driem propose that the dispersal of ancient altaic language communities is reflected by the early holocene dissemination of haplogroup c2 m217 if the paternal lineage c2 m217 is correlated with altaic linguistic affinity as appears to be the case for turkic mongolic and tungusic then japanese is no father tongue and neither is korean this ychromosomal haplogroup accounts for 11 of korean paternal lineages and the frequency of the lineage is even more reduced in japan yet this molecular marker may still be a tracer for the introduction of altaic language to the archipelago where the paternal lineage has persisted albeit in a frequency of just 6 juha janhunen hypothesized that the ancestral languages of turkic mongolic tungusic korean and japanese were spoken in a relatively small area comprising presentday north korea southern manchuria and southeastern mongolia however janhunen is sceptical about an affiliation of japanese to altaic while andrás rónatas remarked that a relationship between altaic and japanese if it ever existed must be more remote than the relationship of any two of the indoeuropean languages77 ramsey stated that the genetic relationship between korean and japanese if it in fact exists is probably more complex and distant than we can imagine on the basis of our present state of knowledge supporters of the altaic hypothesis formerly set the date of the protoaltaic language at around 4000 bc but today at around 5000 bc or 6000 bc this would make altaic a language family older than indoeuropean around 3000 to 4000 bc according to mainstream hypotheses but considerably younger than afroasiatic c 10000 bc33 or 11000 to 16000 bc3536 according to different sources see also references citations sources further reading external links austrian german

dialects which are traditionally spoken but rarely written in austria it has been standardized with the publishing of the österreichisches wörterbuch in 1951 history austrian german has its beginning in the mid18th century when empress maria theresa and her son joseph ii introduced compulsory schooling in 1774 and several reforms of administration in their multilingual habsburg empire at the time the written standard was oberdeutsche schreibsprache upper german written language which was highly influenced by the bavarian and alemannic dialects of austria another option was to create a new standard based on the southern german dialects as proposed by the linguist johann siegmund popowitsch instead they decided for pragmatic reasons to adopt the alreadystandardized chancellery language of saxony sächsische kanzleisprache or meißner kanzleideutsch which was based on the administrative language of the nonaustrian area of meißen and dresden austria high german hochdeutsch in österreich

the process of introducing the new written standard was led by joseph von sonnenfels since 1951 the standardized form of austrian german for official governmental use and in schools has been defined

understanding wiener absichtserklärung signed in vienna in 1996 the eszett or sharp s ß is used in austria as in germany but unlike in switzerland distinctions in vocabulary persist for example in culinary terms for which communication with germans is frequently difficult and administrative and legal language because of austrias exclusion from the development of a german nationstate in the late

austrian german spoken by most austrians which is distinct from that of germany or switzerland in the field of german dialectology the notion of standard austrian german has been both debated and defended by german linguists since the 1970s a one standard german axiom effectively preventing the development of newer standards of german has recently been offered as a characteristic of the field former spoken standard until 1918 the spoken standard in austria was the schönbrunner deutsch a sociolect spoken by the imperial habsburg family and the nobility of austriahungary the sociolect a variety of standard german is influenced by viennese german and other austrobavarian dialects spoken in eastern austria but is slightly nasalized special written forms for many years austria had a special form of the language for official government documents that is known as österreichische kanzleisprache or austrian chancellery language it is a very traditional form of the language probably derived from medieval deeds and documents and has a very complex structure and vocabulary generally reserved for such documents for most speakers even native speakers this form of the language is generally difficult to understand as it contains many highlyspecialised terms for diplomatic internal official and military matters there are no regional variations because the special written form has been used mainly by a government that has now for centuries been based in vienna österreichische kanzleisprache is now used less and less because of various administrative reforms that reduced the number of traditional civil servants beamte as a result standard austrian german is replacing it in government and administrative texts european union when austria became a member of the european union 23 foodrelated terms were listed in its accession agreement as having the same legal status as the equivalent terms used in germany for example the words for potato tomato and brussels sprouts examples in vocabulary austrian german is the only variety of a pluricentric language recognized under international law or eu primary law grammar verbs in austria as in the germanspeaking parts of switzerland and in southern germany verbs that express a state tend to use sein as the auxiliary verb in the perfect as well as verbs of movement verbs which fall into this category include sitzen to sit liegen to lie and in parts of styria and carinthia schlafen to sleep therefore the perfect of these verbs would be ich bin gesessen ich bin gelegen and ich bin geschlafen respectively in germany the words stehen to stand and gestehen to confess are identical in the present perfect habe gestanden the austrian variant avoids that potential ambiguity bin gestanden from stehen to stand and habe gestanden from gestehen to confess der verbrecher ist vor dem richter gestanden und hat gestanden in addition the preterite simple past is very rarely used in austria especially in the spoken language with the exception of some modal verbs ich sollte ich wollte vocabulary there are many official terms that differ in austrian german from their usage in most parts of germany words used in austria are jänner january rather than januar feber seldom february along with februar heuer this year along with dieses jahr stiege stairs along with treppen rauchfang chimney instead of schornstein many administrative legal and political terms and many food terms including the following there are however some false friends between the two regional varieties dialects classification regional accents in addition to the standard variety in everyday life most austrians speak one of a number of upper german dialects while strong forms of the various dialects are not fully mutually intelligible to northern germans communication is much easier in bavaria especially rural areas where the bavarian dialect still predominates as the mother tongue the central austrobavarian dialects are more intelligible to speakers of standard german than the southern austrobavarian dialects of tyrol viennese the austrobavarian dialect of vienna is seen for many in germany as quintessentially austrian the people of graz the capital of styria speak yet another dialect which is not very styrian and more easily understood by people from other parts of austria than other styrian dialects for example from western styria simple words in the various dialects are very similar but pronunciation is distinct for each and after listening to a few spoken words it may be possible for an austrian to realise which dialect is being spoken however in regard to the dialects of the deeper valleys of the tyrol other tyroleans are often unable to understand them speakers from the different provinces of austria can easily be distinguished from each other by their particular accents probably more so than bavarians those of carinthia styria vienna upper austria and the tyrol being very characteristic speakers from those regions even those speaking standard german can usually be easily identified by their accent even by an untrained listener several of the dialects have been influenced by contact with nongermanic linguistic groups such as the dialect of carinthia where in the past many speakers were bilingual and in the southeastern portions of the state many still are even today with slovene and the dialect of vienna which has been influenced by immigration during the austrohungarian period particularly from what is today the czech republic the german dialects of south tyrol have been influenced by local romance languages particularly noticeable with the many loanwords from italian and ladin the geographic borderlines between the different accents isoglosses coincide strongly with the borders of the states and also with the border with bavaria with bavarians having a markedly different rhythm of speech in spite of the linguistic similarities references notes citations works

an appropriate collection ie set of shoes this makes it possible to define a choice function directly for an infinite collection of pairs of socks assumed to have no distinguishing features there is no obvious way to make a function that forms a set out of selecting one sock from each pair without invoking the axiom of choice although originally controversial the axiom of choice is now used without reservation by most mathematicians and is included in the standard form of axiomatic set theory zermelofraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice zfc one motivation for this is that a number of generally accepted mathematical results such as tychonoffs theorem require the axiom of choice for their proofs contemporary set theorists also study axioms that are not compatible with the axiom of choice such as the axiom of determinacy the axiom of choice is avoided in some varieties of constructive mathematics although there are varieties of constructive mathematics in which the axiom of choice is embraced statement a choice function also called selector or selection is a function f defined on a collection x of nonempty sets such that for every set a in x fa is an element of a with this concept the axiom can be stated formally this may be expressed as follows each choice function on a collection x of nonempty sets is an element of the cartesian product of the sets in x this is not the most general situation of a cartesian product of a family of sets where a given set can occur more than once as a factor however one can focus on elements of such a product that select the same element every time a given set appears as factor and such elements correspond to an element of the cartesian product of all distinct sets in the family the axiom of choice asserts the existence of such elements it is therefore equivalent to nomenclature in this article and other discussions of the axiom of choice the following abbreviations are common variants there are many other equivalent statements of the axiom of choice these are equivalent in the sense that in the presence of other basic axioms of set theory they imply the axiom of choice and are implied by it one variation avoids the use of choice functions by in effect replacing each choice function with its range this can be formalized in firstorder logic as note that p  q  r is logically equivalent to p  q  r in english this firstorder sentence reads this guarantees for any partition of a set x the existence of a subset c of x containing exactly one element from each part of the partition another equivalent axiom only considers collections x that are essentially powersets of other sets authors who use this formulation often speak of the choice function on a but this is a slightly different notion of choice function its domain is the power set of a with the empty set removed and so makes sense for any set a whereas with the definition used elsewhere in this article the domain of a choice function on a collection of sets is that collection and so only makes sense for sets of sets with this alternate notion of choice function the axiom of choice can be compactly stated as which is equivalent to the negation of the axiom can thus be expressed as restriction to finite sets the usual statement of the axiom of choice does not specify whether the collection of nonempty sets is finite or infinite and thus implies that every finite collection of nonempty sets has a choice function however that particular case is a theorem of the zermelofraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice zf it is easily proved by the principle of finite induction in the even simpler case of a collection of one set a choice function just corresponds to an element so this instance of the axiom of choice says that every nonempty set has an element this holds trivially the axiom of choice can be seen as asserting the generalization of this property already evident for finite collections to arbitrary collections usage until the late 19th century the axiom of choice was often used implicitly although it had not yet been formally stated for example after having established that the set x contains only nonempty sets a mathematician might have said let fs be one of the members of s for all s in x to define a function f in general it is impossible to prove that f exists without the axiom of choice but this seems to have gone unnoticed until zermelo examples the nature of the individual nonempty sets in the collection may make it possible to avoid the axiom of choice even for certain infinite collections for example suppose that each member of the collection x is a nonempty subset of the natural numbers every such subset has a smallest element so to specify our choice function we can simply say that it maps each set to the least element of that set this gives us a definite choice of an element from each set and makes it unnecessary to add the axiom of choice to our axioms of set theory the difficulty appears when there is no natural choice of elements from each set if we cannot make explicit choices how do we know that our selection forms a legitimate set as defined by the other zf axioms of set theory for example suppose that x is the set of all nonempty subsets of the real numbers first we might try to proceed as if x were finite if we try to choose an element from each set then because x is infinite our choice procedure will never come to an end and consequently we shall never be able to produce a choice function for all of x next we might try specifying the least element from each set but some subsets of the real numbers do not have least elements for example the open interval 01 does not have a least element if x is in 01 then so is x2 and x2 is always strictly smaller than x so this attempt also fails additionally consider for instance the unit circle s and the action on s by a group g consisting of all rational rotations that is rotations by angles which are rational multiples of π here g is countable while s is uncountable hence s breaks up into uncountably many orbits under g using the axiom of choice we could pick a single point from each orbit obtaining an uncountable subset x of s with the property that all of its translates by g are disjoint from x the set of those translates partitions the circle into a countable collection of disjoint sets which are all pairwise congruent since x is not measurable for any rotationinvariant countably additive finite measure on s finding an algorithm to form a set from selecting a point in each orbit requires that one add the axiom of choice to our axioms of set theory see nonmeasurable set for more details in classical arithmetic the natural numbers are wellordered for every nonempty subset of the natural numbers there is a unique least element under the natural ordering in this way one may specify a set from any given subset one might say even though the usual ordering of the real numbers does not work it may be possible to find a different ordering of the real numbers which is a wellordering then our choice function can choose the least element of every set under our unusual ordering the problem then becomes that of constructing a wellordering which turns out to require the axiom of choice for its existence every set can be wellordered if and only if the axiom of choice holds criticism and acceptance a proof requiring the axiom of choice may establish the existence of an object without explicitly defining the object in the language of set theory for example while the axiom of choice implies that there is a wellordering of the real numbers there are models of set theory with the axiom of choice in which no individual wellordering of the reals is definable similarly although a subset of the real numbers that is not lebesgue measurable can be proved to exist using the axiom of choice it is consistent that no such set is definable the axiom of choice proves the existence of these intangibles objects that are proved to exist but which cannot be explicitly constructed which may conflict with some philosophical principles because there is no canonical wellordering of all sets a construction that relies on a wellordering may not produce a canonical result even if a canonical result is desired as is often the case in category theory this has been used as an argument against the use of the axiom of choice another argument against the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of objects that may seem counterintuitive one example is the banachtarski paradox which says that it is possible to decompose the 3dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and using only rotations and translations reassemble the pieces into two solid balls each with the same volume as the original the pieces in this decomposition constructed using the axiom of choice are nonmeasurable sets moreover paradoxical consequences of the axiom of choice for the nosignaling principle in physics have recently been pointed out despite these seemingly paradoxical results most mathematicians accept the axiom of choice as a valid principle for proving new results in mathematics but the debate is interesting enough that it is considered notable when a theorem in zfc zf plus ac is logically equivalent with just the zf axioms to the axiom of choice and mathematicians look for results that require the axiom of choice to be false though this type of deduction is less common than the type that requires the axiom of choice to be true theorems of zf hold true in any model of that theory regardless of the truth or falsity of the axiom of choice in that particular model the implications of choice below including weaker versions of the axiom itself are listed because they are not theorems of zf the banachtarski paradox for example is neither provable nor disprovable from zf alone it is impossible to construct the required decomposition of the unit ball in zf but also impossible to prove there is no such decomposition such statements can be rephrased as conditional statementsfor example if ac holds then the decomposition in the banachtarski paradox exists such conditional statements are provable in zf when the original statements are provable from zf and the axiom of choice in constructive mathematics as discussed above in the classical theory of zfc the axiom of choice enables nonconstructive proofs in which the existence of a type of object is proved without an explicit instance being constructed in fact in set theory and topos theory diaconescus theorem shows that the axiom of choice implies the law of excluded middle the principle is thus not available in constructive set theory where nonclassical logic is employed the situation is different when the principle is formulated in martinlöf type theory there and higherorder heyting arithmetic the appropriate statement of the axiom of choice is depending on approach included as an axiom or provable as a theorem a cause for this difference is that the axiom of choice in type theory does not have the extensionality properties that the axiom of choice in constructive set theory does the type theoretical context is discussed further below different choice principles have been thoroughly studied in the constructive contexts and the principles status varies between different school and varieties of the constructive mathematics some results in constructive set theory use the axiom of countable choice or the axiom of dependent choice which do not imply the law of the excluded middle errett bishop who is notable for developing a framework for constructive analysis argued that an axiom of choice was constructively acceptable saying although the axiom of countable choice in particular is commonly used in constructive mathematics its use has also been questioned independence in 1938 kurt gödel showed that the negation of the axiom of choice is not a theorem of zf by constructing an inner model the constructible universe that satisfies zfc thus showing that zfc is consistent if zf itself is consistent in 1963 paul cohen employed the technique of forcing developed for this purpose to show that assuming zf is consistent the axiom of choice itself is not a theorem of zf he did this by constructing a much more complex model that satisfies zfc zf with the negation of ac added as axiom and thus showing that zfc is consistent together these results establish that the axiom of choice is logically independent of zf the assumption that zf is consistent is harmless because adding another axiom to an already inconsistent system cannot make the situation worse because of independence the decision whether to use the axiom of choice or its negation in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory it must be made on other grounds one argument in favor of using the axiom of choice is that it is convenient because it allows one to prove some simplifying propositions that otherwise could not be proved many theorems provable using choice are of an elegant general character the cardinalities of any two sets are comparable every nontrivial ring with unity has a maximal ideal every vector space has a basis every connected graph has a spanning tree and every product of compact spaces is compact among many others without the axiom of choice these theorems may not hold for mathematical objects of large cardinalitymay 2023 the proof of the independence result also shows that a wide class of mathematical statements including all statements that can be phrased in the language of peano arithmetic are provable in zf if and only if they are provable in zfc statements in this class include the statement that p  np the riemann hypothesis and many other unsolved mathematical problems when attempting to solve problems in this class it makes no difference whether zf or zfc is employed if the only question is the existence of a proof it is possible however that there is a shorter proof of a theorem from zfc than from zf the axiom of choice is not the only significant statement that is independent of zf for example the generalized continuum hypothesis gch is not only independent of zf but also independent of zfc however zf plus gch implies ac making gch a strictly stronger claim than ac even though they are both independent of zf stronger axioms the axiom of constructibility and the generalized continuum hypothesis each imply the axiom of choice and so are strictly stronger than it in class theories such as von neumannbernaysgödel set theory and morsekelley set theory there is an axiom called the axiom of global choice that is stronger than the axiom of choice for sets because it also applies to proper classes the axiom of global choice follows from the axiom of limitation of size tarskis axiom which is used in tarskigrothendieck set theory and states in the vernacular that every set belongs to some grothendieck universe is stronger than the axiom of choice equivalents there are important statements that assuming the axioms of zf but neither ac nor ac are equivalent to the axiom of choice the most important among them are zorns lemma and the wellordering theorem in fact zermelo initially introduced the axiom of choice in order to formalize his proof of the wellordering theorem category theory several results in category theory invoke the axiom of choice for their proof these results might be weaker than equivalent to or stronger than the axiom of choice depending on the strength of the technical foundations for example if one defines categories in terms of sets that is as sets of objects and morphisms usually called a small category or even locally small categories whose homobjects are sets then there is no category of all sets and so it is difficult for a categorytheoretic formulation to apply to all sets on the other hand other foundational descriptions of category theory are considerably stronger and an identical categorytheoretic statement of choice may be stronger than the standard formulation à la class theory mentioned above examples of categorytheoretic statements which require choice include weaker forms there are several weaker statements that are not equivalent to the axiom of choice but are closely related one example is the axiom of dependent choice dc a still weaker example is the axiom of countable choice acω or cc which states that a choice function exists for any countable set of nonempty sets these axioms are sufficient for many proofs in elementary mathematical analysis and are consistent with some principles such as the lebesgue measurability of all sets of reals that are disprovable from the full axiom of choice given an ordinal parameter α  ω2  for every set s with rank less than α s is wellorderable given an ordinal parameter α  1  for every set s with hartogs number less than ωα s is wellorderable as the ordinal parameter is increased these approximate the full axiom of choice more and more closely other choice axioms weaker than axiom of choice include the boolean prime ideal theorem and the axiom of uniformization the former is equivalent in zf to tarskis 1930 ultrafilter lemma every filter is a subset of some ultrafilter results requiring ac or weaker forms but weaker than it one of the most interesting aspects of the axiom of choice is the large number of places in mathematics where it shows up here are some statements that require the axiom of choice in the sense that they are not provable from zf but are provable from zfc zf plus ac equivalently these statements are true in all models of zfc but false in some models of zf possibly equivalent implications of ac there are several historically important settheoretic statements implied by ac whose equivalence to ac is open zermelo cited the partition principle which was formulated before ac itself as a justification for believing ac in 1906 russell declared pp to be equivalent but whether the partition principle implies ac is the oldest open problem in set theory and the equivalences of the other statements are similarly hard old open problems in every known model of zf where choice fails these statements fail too but it is unknown whether they can hold without choice stronger forms of the negation of ac if we abbreviate by bp the claim that every set of real numbers has the property of baire then bp is stronger than ac which asserts the nonexistence of any choice function on perhaps only a single set of nonempty sets strengthened negations may be compatible with weakened forms of ac for example zf  dc  bp is consistent if zf is it is also consistent with zf  dc that every set of reals is lebesgue measurable but this consistency result due to robert m solovay cannot be proved in zfc itself but requires a mild large cardinal assumption the existence of an inaccessible cardinal the much stronger axiom of determinacy or ad implies that every set of reals is lebesgue measurable has the property of baire and has the perfect set property all three of these results are refuted by ac itself zf  dc  ad is consistent provided that a sufficiently strong large cardinal axiom is consistent the existence of infinitely many woodin cardinals quines system of axiomatic set theory new foundations nf takes its name from the title new foundations for mathematical logic of the 1937 article that introduced it in the nf axiomatic system the axiom of choice can be disproved statements consistent with the negation of ac there are models of zermelofraenkel set theory in which the axiom of choice is false we shall abbreviate zermelofraenkel set theory plus the negation of the axiom of choice by zfc for certain models of zfc it is possible to validate the negation of some standard zfc theorems as any model of zfc is also a model of zf it is the case that for each of the following statements there exists a model of zf in which that statement is true for proofs see jech additionally by imposing definability conditions on sets in the sense of descriptive set theory one can often prove restricted versions of the axiom of choice from axioms incompatible with general choice this appears for example in the moschovakis coding lemma axiom of choice in type theory in type theory a different kind of statement is known as the axiom of choice this form begins with two types σ and τ and a relation r between objects of type σ and objects of type τ the axiom of choice states that if for each x of type σ there exists a y of type τ such that rxy then there is a function f from objects of type σ to objects of type τ such that rxfx holds for all x of type σ unlike in set theory the axiom of choice in type theory is typically stated as an axiom scheme in which r varies over all formulas or over all formulas of a particular logical form quotations this is a joke although the three are mathematically equivalent many mathematicians find the axiom of choice intuitive the wellordering principle counterintuitive and zorns lemma too complex for any intuition the observation here is that one can define a function to select from an infinite number of pairs of shoes for example by choosing the left shoe from each pair without the axiom of choice one cannot assert that such a function exists for pairs of socks because left and right socks are presumably indistinguishable polishamerican mathematician jan mycielski relates this anecdote in a 2006 article in the notices of the ams this quote comes from the famous april fools day article in the computer recreations column of the scientific american april 1989 notes references external links attila categories attila the hun 5thcentury hunnic kings 5thcentury monarchs in europe 406 births 453 deaths deaths from choking genocide perpetrators attilid dynasty attila ə ə or ˈ at 406453 frequently called attila the hun was the ruler of the huns from 434 until his death in march 453 he was also the leader of an empire consisting of huns ostrogoths alans and bulgars among others in central and eastern europe as nephews to rugila attila and his elder brother bleda succeeded him to the throne in 435 ruling jointly until the death of bleda in 445 during his reign attila was one of the most feared enemies of the western and eastern roman empires he crossed the danube twice and plundered the balkans but was unable to take constantinople in 441 he led an invasion of the eastern roman byzantine empire the success of which emboldened him to invade the west he also attempted to conquer roman gaul modern france crossing the rhine in 451 and marching as far as aurelianum orléans before being stopped in the battle of the catalaunian plains he subsequently invaded italy devastating the northern provinces but was unable to take rome he planned for further campaigns against the romans but died in 453 after attilas death his close adviser ardaric of the gepids led a germanic revolt against hunnic rule after which the hunnic empire quickly collapsed attila lived on as a character in germanic heroic legend etymology many scholars have argued that the name attila derives from east germanic origin attila is formed from the gothic or gepidic noun atta father by means of the diminutive suffix ila meaning little father compare wulfila from wulfs wolf and ila ie little wolf the gothic etymology was first proposed by jacob and wilhelm grimm in the early 19th century maenchenhelfen notes that this derivation of the name offers neither phonetic nor semantic difficulties and gerhard doerfer notes that the name is simply correct gothic alexander savelyev and choongwon jeong 2020 similarly state that attilas name must have been gothic in origin the name has sometimes been interpreted as a germanization of a name of hunnic origin other scholars have argued for a turkic origin of the name omeljan pritsak considered ἀττίλα attíla a composite titlename which derived from turkic es great old and til sea ocean and the suffix a the stressed back syllabic til assimilated the front member es so it became as it is a nominative in form of attíl  etsíl  es tíl with the meaning the oceanic universal ruler j j mikkola connected it with turkic āt name fame as another turkic possibility h althof 1902 considered it was related to turkish atli horseman cavalier or turkish at horse and dil tongue maenchenhelfen argues that pritsaks derivation is ingenious but for many reasons unacceptable while dismissing mikkolas as too farfetched to be taken seriously m snædal similarly notes that none of these proposals has achieved wide acceptance criticizing the proposals of finding turkic or other etymologies for attila doerfer notes that king george vi of the united kingdom had a name of greek origin and süleyman the magnificent had a name of arabic origin yet that does not make them greeks or arabs it is therefore plausible that attila would have a name not of hunnic origin historian hyun jin kim however has argued that the turkic etymology is more probable m snædal in a paper that rejects the germanic derivation but notes the problems with the existing proposed turkic etymologies argues that attilas name could have originated from turkicmongolian at adyyagta gelding warhorse and turkish atlı horseman cavalier meaning possessor of geldings provider of warhorses historiography and source the historiography of attila is faced with a major challenge in that the only complete sources are written in greek and latin by the enemies of the huns attilas contemporaries left many testimonials of his life but only fragments of these remain priscus was a byzantine diplomat and historian who wrote in greek and he was both a witness to and an actor in the story of attila as a member of the embassy of theodosius ii at the hunnic court in 449 he was obviously biased by his political position but his writing is a major source for information on the life of attila and he is the only person known to have recorded a physical description of him he wrote a history of the late roman empire in eight books covering the period from 430 to 476 only fragments of priscus work remain it was cited extensively by 6thcentury historians procopius and jordanes especially in jordanes the origin and deeds of the goths which contains numerous references to priscuss history and it is also an important source of information about the hunnic empire and its neighbors he describes the legacy of attila and the hunnic people for a century after attilas death marcellinus comes a chancellor of justinian during the same era also describes the relations between the huns and the eastern roman empire numerous ecclesiastical writings contain useful but scattered information sometimes difficult to authenticate or distorted by years of handcopying between the 6th and 17th centuries the hungarian writers of the 12th century wished to portray the huns in a positive light as their glorious ancestors and so repressed certain historical elements and added their own legends the literature and knowledge of the huns themselves was transmitted orally by means of epics and chanted poems that were handed down from generation to generation indirectly fragments of this oral history have reached us via the literature of the scandinavians and germans neighbors of the huns who wrote between the 9th and 13th centuries attila is a major character in many medieval epics such as the nibelungenlied as well as various eddas and sagas archaeological investigation has uncovered some details about the lifestyle art and warfare of the huns there are a few traces of battles and sieges but the tomb of attila and the location of his capital have not yet been found early life and background the huns were a group of eurasian nomads appearing from east of the volga who migrated further into western europe c 370 and built up an enormous empire there their main military techniques were mounted archery and javelin throwing they were in the process of developing settlements before their arrival in western europe yet the huns were a society of pastoral warriors whose primary form of nourishment was meat and milk products of their herds the origin and language of the huns has been the subject of debate for centuries according to some theories their leaders at least may have spoken a turkic language perhaps closest to the modern chuvash language according to the encyclopedia of european peoples the huns especially those who migrated to the west may have been a combination of central asian turkic mongolic and ugric stocks attilas father mundzuk was the brother of kings octar and ruga who reigned jointly over the hunnic empire in the early fifth century this form of diarchy was recurrent with the huns but historians are unsure whether it was institutionalized merely customary or an occasional occurrence his family was from a noble lineage but it is uncertain whether they constituted a royal dynasty attilas birthdate is debated journalist éric deschodt and writer herman schreiber have proposed a date of 395 however historian iaroslav lebedynsky and archaeologist katalin escher prefer an estimate between the 390s and the first decade of the fifth century several historians have proposed 406 as the date attila grew up in a rapidly changing world his people were nomads who had only recently arrived in europe they crossed the volga river during the 370s and annexed the territory of the alans then attacked the gothic kingdom between the carpathian mountains and the danube they were a very mobile people whose mounted archers had acquired a reputation for invincibility and the germanic tribes seemed unable to withstand them vast populations fleeing the huns moved from germania into the roman empire in the west and south and along the banks of the rhine and danube in 376 the goths crossed the danube initially submitting to the romans but soon rebelling against emperor valens whom they killed in the battle of adrianople in 378 large numbers of vandals alans suebi and burgundians crossed the rhine and invaded roman gaul on december 31 406 to escape the huns the roman empire had been split in half since 395 and was ruled by two distinct governments one based in ravenna in the west and the other in constantinople in the east the roman emperors both east and west were generally from the theodosian family in attilas lifetime despite several power struggles the huns dominated a vast territory with nebulous borders determined by the will of a constellation of ethnically varied peoples some were assimilated to hunnic nationality whereas many retained their own identities and rulers but acknowledged the suzerainty of the king of the huns the huns were also the indirect source of many of the romans problems driving various germanic tribes into roman territory yet relations between the two empires were cordial the romans used the huns as mercenaries against the germans and even in their civil wars thus the usurper joannes was able to recruit thousands of huns for his army against valentinian iii in 424 it was aëtius later patrician of the west who managed this operation they exchanged ambassadors and hostages the alliance lasting from 401 to 450 and permitting the romans numerous military victories the huns considered the romans to be paying them tribute whereas the romans preferred to view this as payment for services rendered the huns had become a great power by the time that attila came of age during the reign of his uncle ruga to the point that nestorius the patriarch of constantinople deplored the situation with these words they have become both masters and slaves of the romans campaigns against the eastern roman empire the death of rugila also known as rua or ruga in 434 left the sons of his brother mundzuk attila and bleda in control of the united hun tribes at the time of the two brothers accession the hun tribes were bargaining with eastern roman emperor theodosius iis envoys for the return of several renegades who had taken refuge within the eastern roman empire possibly hunnic nobles who disagreed with the brothers assumption of leadership the following year attila and bleda met with the imperial legation at margus požarevac all seated on horseback in the hunnic manner and negotiated an advantageous treaty the romans agreed to return the fugitives to double their previous tribute of 350 roman pounds c 115 kg of gold to open their markets to hunnish traders and to pay a ransom of eight solidi for each roman taken prisoner by the huns the huns satisfied with the treaty decamped from the roman empire and returned to their home in the great hungarian plain perhaps to consolidate and strengthen their empire theodosius used this opportunity to strengthen the walls of constantinople building the citys first sea wall and to build up his border defenses along the danube the huns remained out of roman sight for the next few years while they invaded the sassanid empire they were defeated in armenia by the sassanids abandoned their invasion and turned their attentions back to europe in 440 they reappeared in force on the borders of the roman empire attacking the merchants at the market on the north bank of the danube that had been established by the treaty of 435 crossing the danube they laid waste to the cities of illyricum and forts on the river including according to priscus viminacium a city of moesia their advance began at margus where they demanded that the romans turn over a bishop who had retained property that attila regarded as his while the romans discussed the bishops fate he slipped away secretly to the huns and betrayed the city to them while the huns attacked citystates along the danube the vandals led by geiseric captured the western roman province of africa and its capital of carthage africa was the richest province of the western empire and a main source of food for rome the sassanid shah yazdegerd ii invaded armenia in 441january 2021 the romans stripped the balkan area of forces sending them to sicily in order to mount an expedition against the vandals in africa this left attila and bleda a clear path through illyricum into the balkans which they invaded in 441 the hunnish army sacked margus and viminacium and then took singidunum belgrade and sirmium during 442 theodosius recalled his troops from sicily and ordered a large issue of new coins to finance operations against the huns he believed that he could defeat the huns and refused the hunnish kings demands attila responded with a campaign in 443 for the first time as far as the romans knew his forces were equipped with battering rams and rolling siege towers with which they successfully assaulted the military centers of ratiara and naissus niš and massacred the inhabitants priscus said when we arrived at naissus we found the city deserted as though it had been sacked only a few sick persons lay in the churches we halted at a short distance from the river in an open space for all the ground adjacent to the bank was full of the bones of men slain in war advancing along the nišava river the huns next took serdica sofia philippopolis plovdiv and arcadiopolis lüleburgaz they encountered and destroyed a roman army outside constantinople but were stopped by the double walls of the eastern capital they defeated a second army near callipolis gelibolu theodosius unable to make effective armed resistance admitted defeat sending the magister militum per orientem anatolius to negotiate peace terms the terms were harsher than the previous treaty the emperor agreed to hand over 6000 roman pounds c 2000 kg of gold as punishment for having disobeyed the terms of the treaty during the invasion the yearly tribute was tripled rising to 2100 roman pounds c 700 kg in gold and the ransom for each roman prisoner rose to 12 solidi their demands were met for a time and the hun kings withdrew into the interior of their empire bleda died following the huns withdrawal from byzantium probably around 445 attila then took the throne for himself becoming the sole ruler of the huns solitary kingship in 447 attila again rode south into the eastern roman empire through moesia the roman army under gothic magister militum arnegisclus met him in the battle of the utus and was defeated though not without inflicting heavy losses the huns were left unopposed and rampaged through the balkans as far as thermopylae constantinople itself was saved by the isaurian troops of magister militum per orientem zeno and protected by the intervention of prefect constantinus who organized the reconstruction of the walls that had been previously damaged by earthquakes and in some places to construct a new line of fortification in front of the old callinicus in his life of saint hypatius wrote in the west in 450 attila proclaimed his intent to attack the visigoth kingdom of toulouse by making an alliance with emperor valentinian iii he had previously been on good terms with the western roman empire and its influential general flavius aëtius aëtius had spent a brief exile among the huns in 433 and the troops that attila provided against the goths and bagaudae had helped earn him the largely honorary title of magister militum in the west the gifts and diplomatic efforts of geiseric who opposed and feared the visigoths may also have influenced attilas plans however valentinians sister was honoria who had sent the hunnish king a plea for helpand her engagement ringin order to escape her forced betrothal to a roman senator in the spring of 450 honoria may not have intended a proposal of marriage but attila chose to interpret her message as such he accepted asking for half of the western empire as dowry when valentinian discovered the plan only the influence of his mother galla placidia convinced him to exile honoria rather than killing her he also wrote to attila strenuously denying the legitimacy of the supposed marriage proposal attila sent an emissary to ravenna to proclaim that honoria was innocent that the proposal had been legitimate and that he would come to claim what was rightfully his attila interfered in a succession struggle after the death of a frankish ruler attila supported the elder son while aëtius supported the younger the location and identity of these kings is not known and subject to conjecture attila gathered his vassalsgepids ostrogoths rugians scirians heruls thuringians alans burgundians among othersand began his march west in 451 he arrived in belgica with an army exaggerated by jordanes to half a million strong on april 7 he captured metz he also captured strasbourg  other cities attacked can be determined by the hagiographic vitae written to commemorate their bishops nicasius was slaughtered before the altar of his church in rheims servatus is alleged to have saved tongeren with his prayers as saint genevieve is said to have saved paris lupus bishop of troyes is also credited with saving his city by meeting attila in person aëtius moved to oppose attila gathering troops from among the franks the burgundians and the celts a mission by avitus and attilas continued westward advance convinced the visigoth king theodoric i theodorid to ally with the romans the combined armies reached orléans ahead of attila thus checking and turning back the hunnish advance aëtius gave chase and caught the huns at a place usually assumed to be near catalaunum modern châlonsenchampagne attila decided to fight the romans on plains where he could use his cavalry the two armies clashed in the battle of the catalaunian plains the outcome of which is commonly considered to be a strategic victory for the visigothicroman alliance theodoric was killed in the fighting and aëtius failed to press his advantage according to edward gibbon and edward creasy because he feared the consequences of an overwhelming visigothic triumph as much as he did a defeat from aëtius point of view the best outcome was what occurred theodoric died attila was in retreat and disarray and the romans had the benefit of appearing victorious invasion of italy and death attila returned in 452 to renew his marriage claim with honoria invading and ravaging italy along the way communities became established in what would later become venice as a result of these attacks when the residents fled to small islands in the venetian lagoon his army sacked numerous cities and razed aquileia so completely that it was afterwards hard to recognize its original site aëtius lacked the strength to offer battle but managed to harass and slow attilas advance with only a shadow force attila finally halted at the river po by this point disease and starvation may have taken hold in attilas camp thus hindering his war efforts and potentially contributing to the cessation of invasion emperor valentinian iii sent three envoys the high civilian officers gennadius avienus and trigetius as well as pope leo i who met attila at mincio in the vicinity of mantua and obtained from him the promise that he would withdraw from italy and negotiate peace with the emperor prosper of aquitaine gives a short description of the historic meeting but gives all the credit to leo for the successful negotiation priscus reports that superstitious fear of the fate of alaric gave him pauseas alaric died shortly after sacking rome in 410 italy had suffered from a terrible famine in 451 and her crops were faring little better in 452 attilas devastating invasion of the plains of northern italy this year did not improve the harvest to advance on rome would have required supplies which were not available in italy and taking the city would not have improved attilas supply situation therefore it was more profitable for attila to conclude peace and retreat to his homeland furthermore an east roman force had crossed the danube under the command of another officer also named aetiuswho had participated in the council of chalcedon the previous yearand proceeded to defeat the huns who had been left behind by attila to safeguard their home territories attila hence faced heavy human and natural pressures to retire from italy without ever setting foot south of the po as hydatius writes in his chronica minora death in the eastern roman empire emperor marcian succeeded theodosius ii and stopped paying tribute to the huns attila withdrew from italy to his palace across the danube while making plans to strike at constantinople once more to reclaim tribute however he died in the early months of 453 the conventional account from priscus says that attila was at a feast celebrating his latest marriage this time to the beautiful young ildico the name suggests gothic or ostrogoth origins in the midst of the revels however he suffered severe bleeding and died he may have had a nosebleed and choked to death in a stupor or he may have succumbed to internal bleeding possibly due to ruptured esophageal varices esophageal varices are dilated veins that form in the lower part of the esophagus often caused by years of excessive alcohol consumption they are fragile and can easily rupture leading to death by hemorrhage another account of his death was first recorded 80 years after the events by roman chronicler marcellinus comes it reports that attila king of the huns and ravager of the provinces of europe was pierced by the hand and blade of his wife one modern analyst suggests that he was assassinated but most reject these accounts as no more than hearsay preferring instead the account given by attilas contemporary priscus recounted in the 6th century by jordanes descendants attilas sons ellac dengizich and ernak in their rash eagerness to rule they all alike destroyed his empire they were clamoring that the nations should be divided among them equally and that warlike kings with their peoples should be apportioned to them by lot like a family estate against the treatment as slaves of the basest condition a germanic alliance led by the gepid ruler ardaric who was noted for great loyalty to attila revolted and fought with the huns in pannonia in the battle of nedao 454 ad attilas eldest son ellac was killed in that battle attilas sons regarding the goths as deserters from their rule came against them as though they were seeking fugitive slaves attacked ostrogothic coruler valamir who also fought alongside ardaric and attila at the catalaunian plains but were repelled and some group of huns moved to scythia probably those of ernak his brother dengizich attempted a renewed invasion across the danube in 468 ad but was defeated at the battle of bassianae by the ostrogoths dengizich was killed by romangothic general anagast the following year after which the hunnic dominion ended attilas many children and relatives are known by name and some even by deeds but soon valid genealogical sources all but dried up and there seems to be no verifiable way to trace attilas descendants this has not stopped many genealogists from attempting to reconstruct a valid line of descent for various medieval rulers one of the most credible claims has been that of the nominalia of the bulgarian khans for mythological avitohol and irnik from the dulo clan of the bulgars the hungarian árpád dynasty also claimed to be a direct descendant of attila medieval hungarian chronicles from the hungarian royal court like gesta hungarorum gesta hunnorum et hungarorum chronicon pictum buda chronicle chronica hungarorum claimed that the árpád dynasty and the aba clan are the descendants of attila appearance and character there is no surviving firsthand account of attilas appearance but there is a possible secondhand source provided by jordanes who cites a description given by priscus some scholars have suggested that these features are typically east asian because in combination they fit the physical type of people from eastern asia so attilas ancestors may have come from there other historians have suggested that the same features may have been typical of some scythian people later folklore and iconography the name has many variants in several languages atli and atle in old norse etzel in middle high german nibelungenlied ætla in old english attila atilla and etele in hungarian attila is the most popular attila atilla atilay or atila in turkish and adil and edil in kazakh or adil samesimilar or edil to use in mongolian attila and hun tradition in the medieval hungarian royal court the basic premise of the hungarian medieval chronicle tradition that the huns ie the hungarians coming out twice from scythia the guiding principle of the chronicles was the hunhungarian continuity the hungarian state founder royal dynasty the árpád dynasty claimed to be a direct descendant of the great hun leader attila medieval hungarian chronicles claimed that grand prince árpád of hungary was the descendants of attila árpád grand prince of the hungarians says in the gesta hungarorumthe land stretching between the danube and the tisza used to belong to my forefather the mighty attila king matthias of hungary 14581490 was happy to be described as the second attila the chronica hungarorum by johannes thuróczy set the goal of glorifying attila which was undeservedly neglected moreover he introduced the famous scourge of god characterization to the later hungarian writers because the earlier chronicles remained hidden for a long time thuróczy worked hard to endear attila the hun king with an effort far surpassing his predecessor chroniclers he made attila a model for his victorious ruler king matthias of hungary who had attilas abilities with this he almost brought the hammer of the world to life legends about attila and the sword of mars jordanes embellished the report of priscus reporting that attila had possessed the holy war sword of the scythians which was given to him by mars and made him a prince of the entire world lampert of hersfelds contemporary chronicles report that shortly before the year 1071 the sword of attila had been presented to otto of nordheim by the exiled queen of hungary anastasia of kiev this sword a cavalry sabre now in the kunsthistorisches museum in vienna appears to be the work of hungarian goldsmiths of the ninth or tenth century legends about attila and his meeting with pope leo i an anonymous chronicler of the medieval period represented the meeting of pope leo and atilla as attended also by saint peter and saint paul a miraculous tale calculated to meet the taste of the time this apotheosis was later portrayed artistically by the renaissance artist raphael and sculptor algardi whom eighteenthcentury historian edward gibbon praised for establishing one of the noblest legends of ecclesiastical tradition according to a version of this narrative related in the chronicon pictum a mediaeval hungarian chronicle the pope promised attila that if he left rome in peace one of his successors would receive a holy crown which has been understood as referring to the holy crown of hungary attila in germanic heroic legend some histories and chronicles describe attila as a great and noble king and he plays major roles in three norse texts atlakviða volsunga saga and atlamál the polish chronicle represents attilas name as aquila frutolf of michelsberg and otto of freising pointed out that some songs as vulgar fables and made theoderic the great attila and ermanaric contemporaries when any reader of jordanes knew that this was not the case this refers to the socalled historical poems about dietrich von bern theoderic in which etzel german for attila is dietrichs refuge in exile from his wicked uncle ermenrich ermanaric etzel is most prominent in the poems dietrichs flucht and the rabenschlacht etzel also appears as kriemhilds second noble husband in the nibelungenlied in which kriemhild causes the destruction of both the hunnish kingdom and that of her burgundian relatives early modern and modern reception in 1812 ludwig van beethoven conceived the idea of writing an opera about attila and approached august von kotzebue to write the libretto it was however never written in 1846 giuseppe verdi wrote the opera loosely based on episodes in attilas invasion of italy in world war i allied propaganda referred to germans as the huns based on a 1900 speech by emperor wilhelm ii praising attila the huns military prowess according to jawaharlal nehrus glimpses of world history der spiegel commented on 6 november 1948 that the sword of attila was hanging menacingly over austria american writer cecelia holland wrote the death of attila 1973 a historical novel in which attila appears as a powerful background figure whose life and death deeply affect the protagonists a young hunnic warrior and a germanic one in modern hungary and in turkey attila and its turkish variation atilla are commonly used as a male first name in hungary several public places are named after attila for instance in budapest there are 10 attila streets one of which is an important street behind the buda castle when the turkish armed forces invaded cyprus in 1974 the operations were named after attila the attila plan the 1954 universal international film sign of the pagan starred jack palance as attila see also notes sources external links
